As leafy green vegetables are commonly consumed without additional processing, it is important to evaluate interventions to reduce the presence of human pathogens in these products. Feline calicivirus was used as a model for small round structured viruses on lettuce. The lettuce was inoculated by immersion to simulate contamination from irrigation or wash water. The inoculated lettuce was then exposed to electron beam irradiation at various dose levels to determine survival. The D₁₀-value of the calicivirus on lettuce was determined to be 2.95 kGy. Irradiation to reduce bacterial pathogens on cut lettuce could also reduce the risk associated with small round structured viruses on lettuce."

Elevated concentrations of inorganic arsenic and chromium were found both in the test plants and in the soil around the factory. Multivariate statistical analysis of the results indicated that the dominating pathway of arsenic and chromium from the factory to the leafy vegetables grown nearby was by direct atmospheric deposition, while arsenic in the root crops originated from both the soil and the atmosphere. Consumption of vegetables grown near the source would result in an increased intake of inorganic arsenic, but the intake via the total diet was estimated to be below the provisional tolerable daily intake for inorganic arsenic established by FAO/WHO."

In this context, phenotypic and genotypic signatures have been used since early ages in agriculture to obtain better produce, and can be used today as a strategy to reduce the risk of outbreaks through plant breeding. In this mini-review, we provide an updated view and perspectives on to what extent the selection of biological markers can be used to select safer cultivars of vegetable crops such as tomato (the most studied), leafy greens and cabbage.

The pesticide residues were determined using the multiresidue QuEChERS method by gas chromatography as well as high-performance liquid chromatography. The results indicated that 27% of the total samples contained pesticide residues above the maximum residue limits of each active ingredient. The maximum estimated daily intake obtained for carbon disulphide (CS2), methamidophos, azoxystrobin and cypermethrin were 0.57, 0.07, 0.06 and 0.05 mg kg-1, respectively, which was higher than their acceptable daily intake. It is concluded that inhabitants of the North Central agricultural area of Chile are not exposed to health risks through the consumption of leafy vegetables with the exception of methamidophos. Nevertheless, the high levels of methamidophos detected in leafy vegetables could be considered a potential chronic health risk."

The soil available phosphorous content was increased to 10-17 mg/kg, and the accumulation and developed chemical forms of Cd were analyzed. (3) Results: The experimental results showed that addition of phosphorous to Wa and Eh promoted the growth of water spinach. Accumulation and upward translocation of Cd were also increased in the phosphorus treatment compared with the control. The addition of phosphorus increased the percentage of Cd compartmentalized in undissolved Cd phosphate, which revealed that the mobility and toxicity of Cd were reduced in the phosphorus treatment. However, most of the water spinach was not edible because the vegetable-induced hazard quotient, which was calculated using three methods, showed hazardous potential in general."

Experimental evidence shows that Cd uptake, although it decreases with increasing pH from acid to neutral soils, increases again in alkaline soils, confirming recent finding from other workers. The concentration of Zn in the soil also significantly affects the uptake of Cd, although this is not included in the current prediction models either. The effect of Zn on the uptake of Cd by plants is greater in slightly alkaline soils (pH 7.7) than in slightly acidic or neutral soils. High concentrations of Zn in soil (1000 mg/kg), which are often associated with elevated Cd levels, further increase the Cd concentration factor to values 12 times higher than that predicted by the CLEA model.

Burning of waste can result in the emission of potentially toxic compounds. Although the incineration plants must comply with strict conditions concerning emission control, public concern on the possible impact on human health and the environment still exists. Multiple year (2004-2013) biomonitoring programs were set up around three waste incinerators for early detection of possible effects of stack emissions on the quality of crops and agricultural products. The results showed that the emissions did not affect the quality of crops and cow milk. Concentrations of heavy metals, PAHs and dioxins/PCBs were generally similar to background levels and did not exceed standards for maximum allowable concentrations in foodstuffs (e. g. vegetables and cow milk). Some exceedances of the fluoride standard for cattle feed were found almost every year in the maximum deposition areas of two incinerators. Biomonitoring with leafy vegetables can be used to monitor the real impact of these emissions on agricultural crops and to communicate with all stakeholders."

Among the 35 agricultural plants investigated, microcystins were most phytotoxic to durum wheat, corn, white mustard and garden cress. Leafy vegetables such as dill, parsley and cabbage could bioconcentrate ∼3 times more microcystins in their edible parts than other agricultural plants.

A mix of three Salmonella strains (Reading, Newport, and Typhimurium) was inoculated onto basil leaves and pesto and survived during the experimental period. Whereas the mix of Salmonella survived in pesto stored at 4°C for 4 days, Salmonella was recovered from inoculated leaves for up to 18 days at 20 to 22°C. Although the steady decline of Salmonella on leaves and in pesto suggests a lack of growth, it appears that pesto is a hostile environment for Salmonella because the rate of decline in pesto was faster (0.29 log CFU/g/day) than on leaves (0.11 log CFU/g/day). These findings suggest that the dilution of contaminated ingredients and the bactericidal effect of the pesto environment helped to further reduce the level of enteric organisms during storage, which may have applications for food safety."

Results showed that metals are more likely to accumulate in fruit vegetables (8.8, 63.8 and 47.8 mg/kg DW for Ni, Cu, and Zn, respectively), followed by leafy vegetables (6.5, 60.9 and 42.6 mg/kg DW for Ni, Cu, and Zn, respectively) and finally root vegetables (5.4, 40.0 and 27.3 mg/kg DW for Ni, Cu, and Zn, respectively). The levels of the metals match with those reported for similar vegetables from some other parts of the world. For all foodstuffs, EDI and THQ were below the threshold values for Cu (EDI 11.30; THQ 0.283) and Zn (EDI 6.86; THQ 0.023), while they exceeded the thresholds for Ni (EDI 20.71; THQ 1.035), indicating an obvious health risk over a life time of exposure."

PTE concentration decreased in both roots and shoots of all leafy vegetables grown on zeolite amended soils, especially at high amendment dose (10%). The uptake of PTEs mainly depended on plant species, PTE type and amendment dose. With the exception of Zn in spinach, the bioaccumulation factor for roots was higher than for shoots. Generally, lettuce displayed the highest PTE bioaccumulation capacity, followed by spinach and parsley.

Leafy greens, including cabbage, are fresh foods rarely heated before consumption, which enables foodborne illness. The need for improved safety of fresh food drives the demand for nonthermal food processes to decrease the risk of pathogens while maintaining fresh quality. This study examines the efficacy of electron-beam (e-beam) irradiation in decreasing indigenous microflora on fresh-cut cabbage and determines the optimal dosage to pasteurize fresh-cut cabbage inoculated with Escherichia coli K-12. Fresh-cut cabbage (100 g) was inoculated with ∼8 log E. coli K-12 and e-beam irradiated at doses of 0, 1.0, 2.3, or 4.0 kGy. At 2.3 kGy there was <1.0 log indigenous microflora remaining, indicating greater than a 4.0-log reduction by e-beam. At a 4.0-kGy dose there was >7-log reduction of E. coli K-12 in the fresh-cut cabbage. The D(10)-value for E. coli K-12 in fresh-cut cabbage was 0.564 kGy. E-beam irradiation is thus a viable nonthermal treatment that extends the shelf life and increases the safety of fresh cabbage by reducing or eliminating indigenous microflora and unwanted pathogens."

Populations of E. coli O157:H7 were assessed in fresh-cut lettuce stored at 4, 8, 13 and 16 °C using 6-8 replicates in each analysis point in order to capture experimental variability. The pathogen was able to grow at temperatures ≥8 °C, although at low temperatures, growth data presented a high variability between replicates. Indeed, at 8 °C after 15 days, some replicates did not show growth while other replicates did present an increase. A growth primary model was fitted to the raw growth data to estimate lag time and maximum growth rate. The prediction and confidence bands for the fitted growth models were estimated based on Monte-Carlo method. The estimated maximum growth rates (log cfu/day) corresponded to 0.14 (95% CI: 0.06-0.31), 0.55 (95% CI: 0.17-1.20) and 1.43 (95% CI: 0.82-2.15) for 8, 13 and 16 °C, respectively.

Cadmium bioaccessibility in the gastric phase for yellow soil (YS) cabbage (40.84%) and calcareous soil (CS) cabbage (21.54%) was significantly higher than small intestinal phase with the corresponding values of 21.2% and 11.11%, respectively. Cadmium bioavailability was higher in YS cabbage (5.27%-14.66%) than in CS cabbage (1.12%-9.64%). Cadmium concentrations (>0.74 μg) transported from YS and CS cabbage were able to induce oxidative (MDA, H2O2) stress by inhibiting antioxidant (SOD, GPx) enzyme activities in human liver cells (HL-7702). Additionally the study revealed that the ingestion of Cd contaminated Chinese cabbage grown in acidic soil (yellow soil) weakened the antioxidant defense system under all levels of contamination (2, 6, and 9 mg·kg(-1)) which ultimately escalated the oxidative stress in liver cells; however, in case of CS cabbage, a marked oxidative stress was observed only at 9 mg kg(-1) Cd level of soil. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor Cd concentrations in leafy vegetables grown on acidic soils to minimize human health risk."

The results showed that lower levels of Li in soil (20 mg Li kg-1) improve the growth of spinach plants, while a higher concentration of applied Li enhanced the pigment contents. Higher concentrations of Li in soil interfered with potassium and calcium uptake in plants. Moreover, increasing Li concentration resulted in higher activities of antioxidant enzymes activity in spinach shoots. From these results, it is concluded that spinach shoot accumulated higher concentrations of Li without showing any visual toxicity symptoms. Therefore, the study concludes that Li ion was mostly deposited in leaves rather than in roots which may cause potential human health risk on the consumption of Li-contaminated plants.

The accumulated DEHP amount in the edible part and roots of SHQ increased as the DEHP concentration in the soil increased. DEHP accumulation was higher in the roots than in the edible part of the plant. The root concentration factors and bioaccumulation factors for DEHP in SHQ were 0.13-2.49 and 0.03-2.00, respectively. The DEHP translocation factors were below 1.0, indicating that DEHP preferentially accumulated in plant roots. The DEHP risk index in the edible part of SHQ in relation to the human body and in terms of dietary exposure risk assessment was also below 1.0, indicating a low health risk. High DEHP concentrations caused 1) inhibition of SHQ growth, 2) an increase in SHQ chlorophyll and malondialdehyde contents and 3) a decrease in soluble sugar and vitamin contents. Low DEHP concentrations stimulated total superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and catalase activities, while high DEHP levels showed an inhibitory effect. DEHP presence in soil affected not only SHQ growth but also quality. Our results provide the data needed for the proper assessment of food safety and the ecological impact of DEHP contamination in agricultural soils."

The consumption habits of the studied population were extracted from the 2010 National Alimentary Survey of Chile. In most cases, the concentrations of trace elements in the edible tissues of vegetables (lettuce, spinach, garlic, onion, carrot, potato, sweet corn, and tomato) were higher in the mining-agricultural area than those in the control area.

Specifically, the arsenic concentrations in the edible tissues of lettuce and spinach were 8.2- and 5.4-fold higher, respectively, in the mining-agricultural area than in the control area. Lettuce was the vegetable of concern due to its relatively high consumption and relatively high concentration of trace elements.

Probabilistic models were also simulated with @RISK™, integrating the fitted monophasic and biphasic models in order to analyze their impact on the estimate of the extent of die-off subsequent to a contamination event in the field.

This study aims to understand the genetic basis underlying the variation in Cd accumulation among B. rapa vegetables. Cd uptake and translocation in 64 B. rapa accessions were compared. The role of the heavy metal ATPase gene BrHMA3 in the variation of Cd accumulation was investigated. BrHMA3 encodes a tonoplast-localized Cd transporter. Five full-length and four truncated haplotypes of the BrHMA3 coding sequence were identified, explaining >80% of the variation in the Cd root to shoot translocation among the 64 accessions and in F2 progeny. Truncated BrHMA3 haplotypes had a 2.3 and 9.3 times higher shoot Cd concentration and Cd translocation ratio, respectively, than full-length haplotypes. When expressed in yeast and Arabidopsis thaliana, full-length BrHMA3 showed activity consistent with a Cd transport function, whereas truncated BrHMA3 did not. Variation in the BrHMA3 promoter sequence had little effect on Cd translocation. Variation in the BrHMA3 coding sequence is a key determinant of Cd translocation to and accumulation in the leaves of B. rapa. Strong alleles of BrHMA3 can be used to breed for B. rapa vegetables that are low in Cd in their edible portions."

Next, we focus on the contamination and persistence of these viruses within three high-risk food commodities-leafy greens, soft red fruits and bivalve mollusks. As opposed to detailing the specific routes by which these foods can be contaminated with enteric viruses, we have chosen to focus on their persistence and specific interactions within the food itself. Therefore, the processes of attachment and internalization of the viruses in foods have been emphasized. Looking forward, the implications of these specific interactions of human enteric viruses with leafy greens, soft red fruits and bivalve mollusks are briefly considered within the context of future prevention and control strategies."

Therefore, there is a high chance of being exposed to pesticide residues of vegetables. The objective of this study was to investigate pesticide residues in leafy vegetables, stalk and stem vegetables from South Korea. A total of 8496 samples were mainly collected from Gwangju and Jeonnam area (the largest production region of leafy vegetables, stalk and stem vegetables) in South Korea from 2010 to 2014. A total of 230 pesticides were used for multi-residue analysis of pesticides. Among 8496 samples, 61 different pesticides (1029 times) were detected in 890 samples, of which 118 samples (1.4%) exceeded the Korea maximum residue limits (MRLs). Samples exceeding the MRLs were mostly found in leafy vegetables (brassica lee ssp. namai, leafy lettuce, spinach, perilla leaves, crown daisy, marsh mallow, aster scaber, pimpinella brachycarpa) and Chinese chive. Procymidone, dimethomorph and azoxystrobin were the most frequently found pesticides. A risk assessment of pesticides exceeding the MRLs was evaluated by calculating the estimated daily intake (EDI) and the acceptable daily intake (ADI). The ratio of EDI to ADI was 0.003-30.4%."

Electrostatic application of organic acids has been shown to be effective as a postharvest safety intervention to reduce E. coli O157:H7 on leafy greens. The effect of LAB electrostatically applied and sprinkler irrigated once over a 4 week growth cycle was evaluated against E. coli O157:H7 on spinach. The results indicated that E. coli O157:H7 when applied once during the 4 week growth cycle will survive in the soil and spinach leaves at harvest. LAB applied electrostatically and by sprinkler irrigation water on the soil and/or leaf surface within the first 4 weeks of the growing cycle resulted in a significant reduction (almost a 3 log10 reduction) of E. coli O157:H7 both on the leaf and in the soil at harvest, regardless of the application time (P < 0.01). LAB surface treatments have the potential to improve the safety of leafy green plants as a preharvest food safety intervention when combined with good agricultural practices."

A total of 174 samples of vegetables (117) and farm environment (57) were analysed to determine enterobacterial contamination and presence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Enterobacterial counts above the detection limit were found in 82.9% vegetable samples and 36.8% environmental samples. The average count was 4.2 log cfu/g or mL, with a maximum value of 6.2 log cfu/g in a parsley sample. Leafy vegetables showed statistically significant higher mean counts than other vegetables. A total of 15 ESBL-producing isolates were obtained from vegetables (14) and water (1) samples and were identified as Serratia fonticola (11) and Rahnella aquatilis (4). Five isolates of S. fonticola were considered multi-drug resistant.

Since vermicompost affects the bioavailability of TMs, the objective of this study was to evaluate its effects on the accumulation of growth of TMs in leafy vegetables. (2) Methods: Two TM-contaminated soils and different types of pak choi and lettuce were used and amended with vermicompost. Besides soil properties, the study assessed vermicompost's influence on the growth, accumulation, and chemical forms of TMs and on the health risks posed by oral intake. (3) Results: Vermicompost could increase the content of soil organic matter, available phosphorus, exchangeable magnesium, and exchangeable potassium, thus promoting the growth of leafy vegetables. The accumulation of four TMs in crops under vermicompost was reduced compared to the control, especially for the concentration of cadmium, which decreased by 60-75%. The vermicompost's influence on changing the chemical form of TMs depended on the TM concentrations, type of TM, and crop species; moreover, blanching effectively reduced the concentrations of TMs in high-mobility chemical forms. Although vermicompost mostly reduced the amount of cadmium consumed via oral intake, cadmium still posed the highest health risk compared to the other three TMs."

The possibility of PBDEs translocation into sweet potato vines from soil samples was evaluated. To prevent the PBDEs from air through that factory, the pot experiments were performed in a greenhouse, which showed that the PBDEs concentration of 24 congeners (tri- through deca-BDE) in the sweet potato vine after 14-days cultivation was 29.90 ng/g, 40-times higher than that in the contaminated soil. After another 14-days, the PBDE concentration decreased to 12.30 ng/g as high-brominated PBDEs were transformed to medium- and/or low-brominated PBDEs in the sweet potato vine. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) values exceeded 20.0 for most of the deca-, nona-, and octa-BDEs but BCFs were below 18.9 for the rest of the medium- and low-brominated PBDEs.

For both pathogens the distribution of log10Trs from lettuce to knife was towards low values. Conversely log10Trs from knife to lettuce ranged from -2.1 to -0.1 for E. coli O157:H7 and -2.0 to 0 for L. monocytogenes, and indicated a more variable phenomenon. Regarding consecutive cuts, a rapid initial transfer was followed by an asymptotic tail at low populations moving to lettuce or residing on knife. E. coli O157:H7 was transferred at slower rates than L. monocytogenes.

The results of the study can provide information regarding cross contamination events in a common household. The constructed model could be a useful tool for the risk-assessment during preparation of leafy-green salads."

When the microbiological risk is already present, preventive measures to limit actual contamination events or pathogen survival are considered intervention strategies. In codes of practice the focus is mainly put on explaining preventive measures. However, it is also important to establish more focused intervention strategies. This review is centered mainly on leafy vegetables as the commodity identified as the highest priority in terms of fresh produce microbial safety from a global perspective. There is no unique preventive measure or intervention strategy that could be applied at one point of the food chain. We should encourage growers of leafy greens to establish procedures based on the HACCP principles at the level of primary production. The traceability of leafy vegetables along the chain is an essential element in ensuring food safety. Thus, in dealing with the food safety issues associated with fresh produce it is clear that a multidisciplinary farm to fork strategy is required."

Literature data on behaviour of this pathogen on fresh-cut lettuce and spinach was taken from published graphs by digitization, published tables or from personal communications.

Variability in the published data was incorporated into the growth model by the use of weighted regression and the 95% prediction limits. A log-linear die-off function was fitted to the data from 13 studies, and the resulting rate constants were fitted to a shifted lognormal distribution (Mean: 0.013; Standard Deviation, 0.010; Shift, 0.001).

In green leafy vegetables, 363 pesticides were analyzed using a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) sample preparation, followed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for 311 residues and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) for 52 residues. The method was in-house validated at two fortification levels, and satisfactory recoveries and precisions were achieved for all residues. No quantifiable residues were found in 35% of the samples, whereas 43 residues belonging to 24 different chemical classes were detected in 130 green leafy vegetables. Among the green leafy vegetables, the highest occurrence frequency was recorded in the rocket, followed by dill and parsley. In 46% of the green leafy vegetables, the residue levels exceeded European Union Maximum Residue Levels (EU MRLs). The most frequently detected pesticides were pendimethalin (22.5%), diuron (38.7%) and pymetrozine (52.5%) in dill, rocket and parsley, respectively."

In this study, a proof-of-concept model was engineered for a phage-based Escherichia coli detection system. We engineered the coliphage T7 to express alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to serve as the signal for E. coli detection. Wild type phoA (T7ALP) and a dominant-active allele, phoA D153G D330N (T7ALP*) was inserted into the T7 genome, with engineered constructs selected by CRISPR-mediated cleavage of unaltered chromosomes and confirmed by PCR. Engineered phages and E. coli target cells were co-incubated for 16 hours to produce lysates with liberated ALP correlated with input cell concentrations. A colorimetric assay used p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) to demonstrate significant ALP production by T7ALP and T7ALP* compared to the vector control (T7EV) (p≤ 0.05). Furthermore, T7ALP* produced 2.5-fold more signal than T7ALP (p≤ 0.05) at pH 10.

Understanding the response of vegetables to Cd stress and applying management strategies may help to reduce the Cd uptake by vegetables. The aim of the present review is to summarize the knowledge concerning the uptake and toxic effects of Cd in vegetables and the different management strategies to combat Cd stress in vegetables. Leafy vegetables grown in Cd contaminated soils potentially accumulate higher concentrations of Cd, posing a threat to food commodities. The Cd toxicity decreases seed germination, growth, biomass and quality of vegetables. This reduces the photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and alteration in mineral nutrition. Toxicity of Cd toxicity also interferes with vegetable biochemistry causing oxidative stress and resulting in decreased antioxidant enzyme activities. Several management options have been employed for the reduction of Cd uptake and toxicity in vegetables. The exogenous application of plant growth regulators, proper mineral nutrition, and the use of organic and inorganic amendments might be useful for reducing Cd toxicity in vegetables. The use of low Cd accumulating vegetable cultivars in conjunction with insolubilizing amendments and proper agricultural practices might be a useful technique for reducing Cd exposure in the food chain."

SEPS-SC015 also increased viral resistance to sodium hypochlorite inactivation by treatment with 30 and 300 ppm bleach at 26 °C for 10 min. However, SEPS-SC015 was not effective at protecting these viruses under UV inactivation. Binding of TuV to SC015 bacteria and SEPS-SC015, visualized using transmission electron microscopy, suggests that protection might be related to direct interaction between SEPS-SC015 and viral particles.

Moreover, distance to village and metal industry had negative impacts on the Mn level in soil. It is necessary to control the pH of soil in tea plantations which are close to villages or metal industries, as well as, to search more appropriate areas, where are far away from villages or metal industries, to plant tea should be taken into consideration. In addition, 17.57% of the samples have higher concentration of Pb than the maximum limits was found in tea plantation of Lishui. Heavy metals (Cr) standards regarding leafy vegetables is used for reference in this study, as there are no maximum levels of contaminants (MLC) in tea. It is significant to construct a targeted standard of heavy metals contents that could applicable throughout the world for reduce the health risks to the consumers."

In this study, two Oryza sativa variants, a hybrid (BG358), a traditional (Suwandel) variety, and a leafy green vegetable crop, Ipomoea aquatica, were exposed under laboratory conditions to natural blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa sampled from a hypereutrophic lake contaminated with MC-LR (3,197.37 ± 1.04 µg/L). Field samples of O. sativa and I. aquatica were collected from farmlands that had been irrigated from a reservoir, containing MC-LR (180 µg/L). MC-LR was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography followed by photodiode-array detection (HPLC-PDA). From the laboratory study, we calculated the potential human health exposure from BG358, Suwandel and I. aquatica as 2.84 ± 0.01, 0.22 ± 0.01, and 0.06 ± 0.01 µg/kg of body weight/day, respectively, whereas the potential health exposures from BG358, Suwandel and I. aquatica collected from the field were 0.10 ± 0.01, 0.009 ± 0.005, and 0.03 ± 0.01 µg/kg of body weight/day, respectively. In certain instances, the results exceeded the World Health Organization's (WHO) tolerable daily intake of MC-LR, posing a potential health risk to humans.

In this study, a DBP-degrading endophytic Bacillus siamensis strain T7 was immobilized in rice husk-derived biochar for bioremediation of DBP-polluted agricultural soils. The effects of this microbe-biochar composite on the soil prokaryotic community and the mechanism by which it regulates DBP degradation, were also investigated. A supplement of T7-biochar composite not only significantly boosted DBP biodegradation in soil by raising the DBP degradation rate constant and half-life from 0.1979 d-1 and 2.3131 d to 0.2434 d-1 and 2.1062 d, respectively, but also impeded DBP uptake by leafy vegetables. The general bioremediation effect of T7-biochar alliance excelled pure T7 suspensions and biochar, by trapping more DBP and boosting its complete degradation in soil. Besides, the combination of strain T7 and biochar can increase the proportion of some beneficial bacteria and boost the functional diversity of soil prokaryotic community, then to a certain extent may reverse the negative effect of DBP pollution on the agricultural soils. These results indicate that the rice-husk-derived biochar is a proper media when utilizing functional microbes into environmental treatment. Overall, T7-biochar composite is a promising soil modifier for soil bioremediation and the production of DBP-free crops."

However, it is efficient in taking up As and Cd from soils and accumulating them in the edible parts. Therefore, it is of significance to reduce its As and Cd content, especially in contaminated soil. In this study, pot experiments were conducted to investigate the ability of As-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata in reducing As and Cd uptake by water spinach under different phosphorus treatments. P. vittata was grown for 60 d in a contaminated-soil amended with P fertilizer (+P) or phosphate rock (+PR), followed by water spinach cultivation for another 30 d. Plant biomass, As and Cd contents in plants and soils, and soil pH were analyzed. We found that, P. vittata coupled with PR decreased the As concentration in water spinach shoots by 42%, probably due to As uptake by P. vittata. Moreover, P. vittata decreased the Cd accumulation in water spinach by 24-44%, probably due to pH increase of 0.47-0.61 after P. vittata cultivation.

The risk assessment model considered five modules: in field, washing step, retail storage, home storage and dose-response. Fifty thousand iterations of a @Risk model built in Excel were run for each of sixty scenarios. These scenarios considered different initial pathogen concentrations, fractions of contaminated produce and chlorine concentrations. For chlorine, seven pre-set concentrations (0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 150 and 250mg/L) and three triangular distributions were considered [RiskTriang(0,5,10mg/L), RiskTriang(0,80,250mg/L) and RiskTriang(10,120,250mg/L)]. The outputs were risk of infection, estimated number of illnesses and estimated percent of illnesses arising from cross-contamination. The QMRA model indicated quantitatively that higher chlorine concentrations resulted in lower risk of illness. When simulation was done with <5mg/L of chlorine, most (>96%) of the illnesses arose from cross-contamination, but when a triangular distribution with 10, 120 and 250mg/L of chlorine was simulated, no illnesses arising from cross-contamination were predicted. Proper control of the sanitizer in the washing step is essential to reduce initial contamination and avoid cross-contamination."

One hundred samples of spinach, dill, cilantro, and cress from the production sites of Shiraz, Iran, and its outskirts were, therefore, examined for lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co) content. The potential health risks of these metals to local residents via the consumption of leafy vegetables were also estimated. The mean concentrations of Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Ni, and Co were 3.21, 0.28, 4.55, 40.44, 3.11, and 1.86 mg/kg dry weight, respectively. The Pb level exceeded the permissible limit of 0.3 mg/kg in 44.7% of vegetable samples. The other elements were, however, within FAO/WHO standards. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Ni, and Co from leafy vegetables was 0.10, 0.01, 0.14, 1.26, 0.10, and 0.06 μg/kg body weight/day, respectively. At the mean and 97.5 percentile levels, all health risk index (HRI) values were less than the safe limit (< 1). Thus, within the area this study was focused on, leafy vegetables did not make a major contribution to the dietary intake of the elements which could be mainly attributed to the low vegetable consumption by the study population (20 g/day). Nevertheless, the lead content of the vegetables should be viewed with some concern. Regular monitoring of heavy metal contamination of foodstuff is recommended to control the sources of contaminants in the food chain."

The potential exposure risks were then evaluated. Overall, pesticide contamination is the most serious risk in the first three months of the calendar year (Jan–Mar); thereafter the levels of contamination tend to decrease. There were 6325 samples (31.97%) that contained pesticide residues, and 768 samples (3.88%) that exceeded the maximum residue limits (MRLs). The highest residue rates and those exceeding MRLs rate were found in celery. Leafy vegetables and legume vegetables were more contaminated than other vegetable groups. The most frequently detected pesticide was procymidone (6.43%). Some banned or restricted pesticides such as HCB, DDT and carbofuran were detected. The highest detected concentration was in cypermethrin (7.40mg/kg). The target hazard quotient (THQ) of all pesticides was <1, and the hazard index (HI) was 0.0872. The results supported that pesticide residues in vegetables may not pose a serious threat to public health in Xinjiang, despite a high detection rate.

However, little is known whether these genes can be used to produce safe foods from plants grown on mercury-contaminated land. We have used Arabidopsis and tobacco as model plants for leafy vegetables, and tomato and rice as representative fruit and grain crops to investigate whether merA and merB expression allows for production of safe foods from mercury-contaminated soils. Our results show that grown on heavily contaminated land with mercury, merA and merB expressing transgenic plants can produce vegetables, fruits and grains safe for human and animal consumption, while the wild-type plants cannot. The merA and merB transgenic plants can also efficiently remove mercury from soil. With increasing mercury contamination problems for the agricultural land worldwide, the use of the merA and merB genes can help produce safe food from mercury-polluted land and also remediate contaminated soils."

We determined chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) concentrations in the soil-plant system from agricultural fields of Siran Valley, Mansehra, Pakistan, to assess their potential health risk. Although the concentrations of the heavy metals in soils were within the permissible limits for agricultural soils, heavy metal concentrations in many of the vegetables exceeded the recommended safe values. Among the six leafy vegetables tested, all had greater than safe limits for As, four also for Cr and two also for Cd. As level was greater than safe limits in all five fruit and flower vegetables, two had Cr, and one had Pb also at unsafe levels. Among the five tuber, bulb, and root vegetables, As was higher than safe limits in all and Cd in one. The transfer factor in all three categories of vegetables followed the descending order Cd > As > Cr > Pb. Daily intake of metals were within limit set by USEPA for all heavy metals except As. The health risk indices for Cr, As, Cd, and Pb indicated that values greater than 1 for As suggest that the vegetables studied here pose a risk of chronic arsenic poisoning, but other heavy metals do not pose such a risk.

The HI values were all below 1, which indicates that there is a low risk of greenhouse vegetable consumption. Soil threshold values (STVs) of heavy metals in GVP system were established according to the health risk assessment. The relatively lower transfer factors of rootstalk and fruit vegetables and higher STVs suggest that these types of vegetables are more suitable for cultivation in greenhouse soils.

Young plants (12 days) were harvested at 1, 10, 20, and 30 days postexposure. No samples were positive for E. coli O157:H7 after direct plating of serial dilutions. Enrichment of all samples from young plants exposed to contaminated soil, manure-amended soil, and irrigation water demonstrated that approximately 21% (113 of 552) of plants were positive for E. coli O157:H7. Approximately 30% (36 of 120) of the mature plants initially irrigated with or grown in contaminated soil (including manure-amended soil) for 15 days were positive for E. coli O157:H7. Based on sterilization of surface tissue, E. coli O157:H7 was in protected locations of lettuce tissue. The results suggest that lettuce exposed to, and grown in the presence of, low numbers of E. coli O157:H7 may become contaminated and thus present a human health risk."

Generally, in the vegetables highest concentrations were detected for Fe, followed by Zn, Mn and Pb. Among the vegetables, highest concentrations of Zn, Cu and Cr were found in Solanum nigrum, while Stellaria media showed the elevated levels of Fe and Cd. Nevertheless, maximum concentrations of Mn and Pb were found in Convolvulus arvensis and Amaranthus viridis, respectively. In the case of soil, highest levels were observed for Fe, followed by Mn, Zn, Pb, Cr and Cu. Translocation of trace metals from soil to the vegetables exhibited highest values for Cd, followed by Zn. Multivariate principal component analysis showed significant anthropogenic contributions of the Pb, Cr, Zn, Cd and Fe in the vegetables. Health risk assessment was evaluated in terms of health risk index, target hazard quotient and hazard index which showed that the intake of some trace metals through vegetables was higher than the recommended values, consequently consumption of the vegetables may be associated with non-carcinogenic health risks. Nonetheless, elevated levels of Cr and Pb were also found to be associated with lifetime carcinogenic risk to the consumers."

E. coli O157:H7 cells stressed by acid, cold, starvation, or NaCl exposure, as well as unstressed cells, were inoculated on the surfaces of rocket salad leaves at 4°C. The effectiveness of two sanitizers (200 ppm of chlorine and 80 ppm of peroxyacetic acid) and deionized water for decontaminating the leaves treated with stressed and unstressed E. coli O157:H7 were evaluated during storage at 10 or 25°C for 0.5, 1, 3, and 7 days. It was found that washing with 80 ppm of peroxyacetic acid was more effective and reduced unstressed and stressed cells of E. coli O157:H7 by about 1 log CFU per leaf on the leaves. There was no apparent difference in the ability of stressed and unstressed cells to survive surface disinfection with the tested agents. Treatments to reduce viable E. coli O157:H7 cells on rocket leaves stored at 25°C were more effective than when used on those stored at 10°C.

The overall goal of this study was to evaluate the risk of vacuum cooling-induced infiltration of Escherichia coli O157:H7 into lettuce using multiphoton microscopy. Multiphoton imaging was chosen as the method to locate E. coli O157:H7 within an intact lettuce leaf due to its high spatial resolution, low background fluorescence, and near-infrared (NIR) excitation source compared to those of conventional confocal microscopy. The variables vacuum cooling, surface moisture, and leaf side were evaluated in a three-way factorial study with E. coli O157:H7 on lettuce. A total of 188 image stacks were collected. The images were analyzed for E. coli O157:H7 association with stomata and E. coli O157:H7 infiltration. The quantitative imaging data were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results indicate that the low-moisture condition led to an increased risk of microbial association with stomata (P < 0.05). Additionally, the interaction between vacuum cooling levels and moisture levels led to an increased risk of infiltration (P < 0.05). This study also demonstrates the potential of multiphoton imaging for improving sensitivity and resolution of imaging-based measurements of microbial interactions with intact leaf structures, including infiltration."

SN10 was therefore used to determine the reduction of toxicity of Chinese leafy vegetables grown in the presence of PbOx in the soil. When compared to control, SN10 treated pots showed improved plant growth characters, i. e. shoot length (5.85 ± 0.56 cm), average leaf area (5.5 ± 0.44 cm2) and root length (7.2 ± 0.45 cm), as established by the plant growth attributes and the results obtained are statistically significant (at P ≤ 0.05) (for a period of 30 days). Furthermore, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electronic Microscopy-Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) studies revealed that PbOx was successfully transformed into a less toxic, water-insoluble precipitate of Pb-bearing carbonate, Phosgenite.

While the order of the ratio of shoot Cd to root Cd (SR ratio) was exactly the opposite of that of TI. In lettuce root, activity of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase decreased significantly under Cd stress.

Retailers selling leafy vegetables are increasingly targeting zero-risk production systems and the associated requirements for irrigation water quality have become more stringent in regulations and quality assurance schemes (QAS) followed by growers. Growers can identify water sources that are contaminated with potential pathogens through a monitoring regime and only use water free of pathogens, but the low prevalence of pathogens makes the use of faecal indicators, particularly E. coli, a more practical approach. Where growers have to utilise water sources of moderate quality, they can reduce the risk of contamination of the edible portion of the crop (i. e. , the leaves) by treating irrigation water before use through physical or chemical disinfection systems, or avoid contact between the leaves and irrigation water through the use of drip or furrow irrigation, or the use of hydroponic growing systems.

Thus, the present study was conducted to examine antimicrobial resistance, including MDR, in diarrhoeagenic E. coli (DEC) and Salmonella isolates obtained from leafy greens from rural and urban areas of India. Of the collected samples (830), 14.1 and 6.5% yielded 117 E. coli (40 DEC and 77 non-DEC) and 54 Salmonella isolates, respectively. Among the DEC pathotypes, enteroaggregative E. coli was the most prevalent (10.2 %), followed by enteropathogenic E. coli (9.4 %), enteroinvasive E. coli (7.6 %) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (6.8 %). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of all bacterial isolates with respect to drugs categorized as critically or highly important in both human and veterinary medicine revealed moderate to high (30-90%) resistance for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, gentamycin and colistin, but relatively low resistance (>30 %) for ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and fosfomycin. Notably, all DEC and more than 90% non-DEC or Salmonella isolates were found to be multidrug-resistant to drugs of both human and animal importance. Overall, the results of the present study suggest that leafy greens are potential reservoirs or sources of multidrug-resistant DEC and Salmonella strains in the rural or urban areas of India."

No fruit samples contained detectable L. monocytogenes. Overall, a total of 21 L. monocytogenes isolates (2.9% of samples) were recovered from a range of products, including dry coleslaw mix (80% shredded cabbage and 20% shredded carrot), bean sprouts, and leafy vegetables such iceberg, romaine, and radicchio lettuce and mixed salad leaves (curly endive, escarole, and radicchio leaves). Dry coleslaw mix appeared to have the highest incidence of Listeria contamination (20%) compared with other products. Listeria contamination was more frequent (P < 0.05) during the summer and autumn months than during the winter and spring months. The 21 L. monocytogenes isolates were subsequently subtyped by genomic macrorestriction techniques using ApaI with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). PFGE of digested DNA produced bands of 79 to 518 kb. Four PFGE profiles were identified, and approximately 50% of the isolates were associated with profile 1. This study indicates that fresh-cut vegetables packaged under a modified atmosphere can support growth of numerous species of Listeria, including L. monocytogenes."

When pathogens internalize in leafy vegetables, the method of identification and quantitative measurement would be called into question. This study was aimed to use Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy integrated with an attenuated total reflectance kit for quantification of Escherichia coli K-12 internalized in baby spinach. The bacteria were inoculated into vascular and intracellar tissues of spinach leaves by syringe injection and the distribution of internalized E. coli K-12 cells was confirmed under scanning electron microscopy (SEM). FTIR measurement following the preparation of bacterial suspension from spinach leaves with high speed pulverizing enabled to detect the absorbance peaks in the amide II region between 1590 and 1490 cm⁻¹ as a fingerprint for the microbes. It was found that the estimated concentrations of E. coli K-12 agreed well with the concentrations determined by plate counting with R² values of 0.98 and 0.97 in peptone water and spinach extracts, respectively. The results demonstrated that FTIR can identify and quantify E. coli K-12 in baby spinach extracts at a limit of detection of approximately 100 CFU/mL in 5 min.

In this study, agricultural soil and vegetable samples were collected from the Yangtze River Delta (approximately 211,700 km2), one of the most developed regions in China, to determine the contamination characteristics of priority PAEs. The total concentrations of six PAEs ranged from 5.42 to 1580 ng·g-1 dry weight in soils and from 10.9 to 16,400 ng·g-1 dry weight in vegetables. Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) accounted for 88.3% and 61.9% of the total PAEs in soils and vegetables, respectively. The spatial distribution of PAEs in the soils was as follows: Shanghai city (70.8-1583 ng·g-1 dw) > Anhui province (46.8-1530 ng·g-1 dw) > Jiangsu province (14.4-558 ng·g-1 dw) > Zhejiang province (5.40-488 ng·g-1 dw). Non-cancer risks exist for adults and children in 6.5% and 7.8% of the sites, respectively. Carcinogenic risks were regarded unacceptable in 5.6% and 1.3% of the sites for adults and children, respectively. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) of PAEs showed positive correlation with lipid content of vegetables. A basic reference of the lipid-content threshold to guarantee the safety of leafy vegetables was proposed based on partition-limited model. We suggested to cultivate vegetables with lipid content <0.21% in most heavily contaminated area in the region. This study provides information for effectively controlling PAEs contamination in soil-plant system in developed districts."

Washing iceberg lettuce with 500 ppm oregano oil for 1, 5, and 10 min reduced the population of Salmonella spp. by (respectively) 1.3, 1.65, and 2.28 log cfu/g following the most challenging inoculation conditions, an inoculum drying period of 2 h under moving air. Across all inoculation conditions, increasing the treatment time significantly increased the reductions in the populations of Salmonella spp. (P < 0.05). Browning and softening of the lettuce leaf surface was observed after 10 min of treatment with oregano oil. For each treatment time, attachment times and drying under static compared with moving air did not significantly affect the antimicrobial efficacy of the various oregano oil treatments (P > 0.05). The results obtained in this study suggest that oregano oil can effectively reduce populations of Salmonella attached to lettuce leaf surfaces. The use of essential oils as an antimicrobial treatment can help to ensure the safety of leafy green products. As used in this study, oregano oil effectively reduced Salmonella spp. , even after the pathogen had dried onto the lettuce leaves. Treatments that incorporate oregano oil therefore hold promise as a biocide treatment for process and packaged lettuce."

The accessions were surface inoculated with a bacterial suspension containing 1 × 107 cells/mL and the attachment was measured 1.5 h after inoculation. Significant differences in attachment were detected between the accessions for p ≤ 0.05. The three most and the three least susceptible accessions were selected and characterized for leaf micro-morphological traits (stomata density and size, surface roughness) and water content. Scanning electron microscopy was used to analyse the stomatal parameters. Roughness was measured by an innovative portable 3D digital microscope. No significant correlation between the attachment of E. coli ATCC 35218 and stomatal parameters was detected, while the attachment was positively correlated with roughness and water content. The E. coli ATCC 35218 population in surface-inoculated leaves was also measured after a UV treatment, which was found to be less effective in reducing bacterial contamination in the rougher leaves. This result suggested that roughness offers UV protection, further highlighting its impact on the microbiological safety of baby leafy greens."

The IC50 indicates that PMMANPs were more toxic than PMMAMPs. Combine-pollution experiments demonstrated that the GI, biomass, root length, and sprout length of the rapeseed under the combined treatment were lower than those subjected to As(V) or PMMANPs single treatment. Analysis of variance showed that the interaction effects of PMMANPs and As(V) for GI and root length were significant, and there was synergistic interaction between PMMANPs and As(V) on rapeseed germination. PMMANPs promoted the accumulation of As in sprouts under high As(V) concentrations (40 and 60 mg/L). The activities of lipase in rapeseed generally increased under single and combined treatments of As(V) and PMMANPs, and while α-amylase activities first increased and then decreased with the increase of PMMANPs.

Although the use for soil fertilizer is a cost-effective solution, it has been found that repeated use of biogas slurry that contains high heavy metal contents can cause pollution to the soil-plant system and risk to human health. The objective of this study was to investigate effects of biogas slurry on the soil-plant system and the human health. We analyzed the heavy metal concentrations (including As, Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr and Cd) in 106 soil samples and 58 plant samples in a farmland amended with biogas slurry in Taihu basin, China. Based on the test results, we assessed the potential human health risk when biogas slurry containing heavy metals was used as a soil fertilizer. The test results indicated that the Cd and Pb concentrations in soils exceeded the contamination limits and Cd exhibited the highest soil-to-root migration potential. Among the 11 plants analyzed, Kalimeris indica had the highest heavy metal absorption capacity. The leafy vegetables showed higher uptake of heavy metals than non-leafy vegetables. The non-carcinogenic risks mainly resulted from As, Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn through plant ingestion exposure. The integrated carcinogenic risks were associated with Cr, As and Cd in which Cr showed the highest risk while Cd showed the lowest risk. Among all the heavy metals analyzed, As and Cd appeared to have a lifetime health threat, which thus should be attenuated during production of biogas slurry to mitigate the heavy metal contamination."

This paper focuses on the pros and cons of previously published QMRAs as well as on the proposal of an alternative approach based on the use of a quantitative microbial contamination modelling to investigate how the selection of the irrigation water sources affect the E. coli loads in leafy greens at harvest. The modified model describes the final E. coli levels of baby spinach when different water sources with different contamination levels are applied and the impact of seasonality. Substantial differences were observed between the irrigation water sources while seasonality only had small effects on the simulated levels of E. coli in the harvested baby spinach. Based on the results, the produce grown using irrigation water from drainage ditches show E. coli levels above threshold levels (2 log CFU/g) while less than 1% of baby spinach irrigated with water obtained from water reservoirs where above this limit. The use of this QMEA model will help growers in the decision-making process to reduce microbial contamination of leafy greens."

Dietary lead intake was estimated by age group (3-6, 7-17, 18-59, and ≥60 years), and relevant health risks were assessed using the margin of exposure (MOE) method. The mean and 95th percentiles (P95) of dietary lead intake were respectively 0.7466 and 2.4525 μg/kg body weight per day for preschool children aged 3-6 years; 0.4739 and 1.5522 μg/kg bw/day for school children aged 7-17 years; 0.3759 and 1.1832 μg/kg bw/day for adults aged 18-59 years; and 0.4031 and 1.3589 μg/kg bw/day for adults aged ≥60 years. The MOE value was less than 1 for preschool children at the mean exposure level and for all age groups at the P95 exposure level. Rice and its products, leafy vegetables, and wheat flour and its products were found to be the primary food sources of lead exposure.

We addressed these risks by quantifying Pb and As in soils and produce from a suburban farm in New Jersey, USA and examining the ability of phosphate-bearing amendments (bone meal, triple super phosphate, manure compost and raised bed soil) in combination with Fe and/or Mn amendments to stabilize these metals and prevent their movement into vegetables. Common produce (tomato, carrot, lettuce, and radish) was grown in soils with 133-307 mg Pb kg-1 and 19-73 mg As kg-1. Our results suggest that vegetables produced on these soils can have Pb and As at levels above health and safety standards, especially root and leafy green vegetables. Phosphate-bearing amendments can reduce extractable Pb but can increase extractable As in soils, and can have similar effects on vegetables. Iron amendment increased both extractable Pb and As, likely due to the presence of elemental sulfur in the Fe amendment, which lowered soil pH, while Mn amendment had the opposite effect. Most of the Pb and As in vegetables appear to be associated with soil particles adhered to the vegetables, and the contribution from uptake was relatively small except for plots treated with Fe-amendments and for carrots. Thus, proper crop selection, rigorous cleaning, and dust and dirt control are critical to reduce the risk of contaminant exposure through the consumption of garden produce."

Pumpkin leaves (Cucurbita sp. ) were spontaneously fermented using the submerged method with 3% NaCl and 3% sucrose. Controls were set up, consisting of leaves with no additions. During fermentation, samples of both treatments were taken at 0, 24, 48, 72 and 168 h to monitor pH and characterize the microbial population through culture-based and molecular-based analyses. Variations between fresh and treated leaves in B-group vitamins, carotenoids, polyphenols, and phytic acid were evaluated. Data revealed that the treatment with addition of NaCl and sucrose hindered the growth of undesired microorganisms; in controls, unwanted microorganisms dominated the bacterial community until 168 h, while in treated samples Lactobacillaceae predominated. Furthermore, the content in folate, β-carotene and lutein increased in treated leaves compared to the fresh ones, while phytic acid diminished indicating an amelioration in the nutritional value of the final product.

The risk model explicitly assumes that all contamination arises from exposure in the field. Extracted data, models, and user inputs were entered into an Excel spreadsheet, and the modeling software @RISK was used to perform Monte Carlo simulations. The model predicts that cut leafy greens that are temperature abused will support the growth of E. coli O157:H7, and populations of the organism may increase by as much a 1 log CFU/day under optimal temperature conditions. When the risk model used a starting level of -1 log CFU/g, with 0.1% of incoming servings contaminated, the predicted numbers of cells per serving were within the range of best available estimates of pathogen levels during the outbreak. The model predicts that levels in the field of -1 log CFU/g and 0.1% prevalence could have resulted in an outbreak approximately the size of the 2006 E. coli O157:H7 outbreak. This quantitative microbial risk assessment model represents a preliminary framework that identifies available data and provides initial risk estimates for pathogenic E. coli in leafy greens.

Specifically, six food groups (leafy vegetables, nonleafy vegetables, fruits, pulses, cereals, and milk), drinking water, and lead air concentration were considered for estimating lead intake. Results indicated highest lead content in leafy vegetables followed by pulses. Fruits showed low lead content and drinking water lead levels were always within tolerable limits.

Using field soil that should have an active indigenous microbial community, internalized populations in lettuce roots were 0.8 to 1.6 log CFU/g after exposure to soil containing E. coli O157:H7 at 5.6 to 6.1 log CFU/g. Internalization of E. coli O157:H7 into leafy green plant roots was higher when E. coli O157:H7 populations in soil were increased to 7 or 8 log CFU/g or when the soil was saturated with water. No differences were noted in the extent to which internalization of E. coli O157:H7 occurred in spinach, lettuce, or parsley roots; however, in saturated soil, maximum levels in parsley occurred later than did those in spinach or lettuce. Translocation of E. coli O157:H7 from roots to leaves was rare; therefore, decreases observed in root populations over time were likely the result of inactivation within the plant tissue. Shiga toxin-negative (nontoxigenic) E. coli O157:H7 isolates were more stable than were virulent isolates in soil, but the degree of internalization of E. coli O157:H7 into roots did not differ between isolate type.

The concentration of the heavy metals As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn in soil and food crops were analyzed and assessed in two study areas. There were greater accumulation of heavy metals in soils from Central Shaanxi (CS) than that from Northern Shaanxi (NS). However, heavy metal concentrations in leafy vegetables were higher in NS compared to CS, particularly Cr accumulation in leafy vegetables. Overall, leafy vegetables contained higher concentrations of heavy metals than fresh fruits and fruit vegetables from both areas. The heavy metal transfer factors (TF) for fresh fruits and fruit vegetables were as follows: Cu > Zn > Cd > Cr > As > Pb. However, in leafy vegetables, Cd had a higher TF value than the other metals tested. The target hazard quotient (THQ) values were less than 1 for fruits and vegetables, except for As in leafy vegetables from NS. The THQ values indicated that As contamination was the most serious concern, followed by Cu > Zn > Cd > Pb > Cr in both areas. The soil threshold value (STV) based on THQ showed that the level of As in leafy vegetables grown in alkaline soil was 10.85, which was inferior to the current standards.

Fresh-cut lettuce is potentially at high risk of causing foodborne illnesses, as it is generally consumed without cooking. Quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRAs) are gaining more attention as an effective tool to assess and control potential risks associated with foodborne pathogens. This study developed a QMRA model for E. coli O157:H7 in fresh-cut lettuce and evaluated the effects of different potential intervention strategies on the reduction of public health risks. The fresh-cut lettuce production and supply chain was modeled from field production, with both irrigation water and soil as initial contamination sources, to consumption at home. The baseline model (with no interventions) predicted a mean probability of 1 illness per 10 million servings and a mean of 2,160 illness cases per year in the United States. All intervention strategies evaluated (chlorine, ultrasound and organic acid, irradiation, bacteriophage, and consumer washing) significantly reduced the estimated mean number of illness cases when compared with the baseline model prediction (from 11.4- to 17.9-fold reduction). Sensitivity analyses indicated that retail and home storage temperature were the most important factors affecting the predicted number of illness cases. The developed QMRA model provided a framework for estimating risk associated with consumption of E. coli O157:H7-contaminated fresh-cut lettuce and can guide the evaluation and development of intervention strategies aimed at reducing such risk."

The phenotypic characteristics, accumulation of hazardous materials and rhizosphere properties of two ecotypes of water spinach in response to water stress were investigated. Flooding significantly enhanced plant growth and decreased Cd and nitrate concentrations in the shoot and root of both ecotypes of water spinach. Flooding extensively changed the physicochemical properties and biological processes in the rhizosphere, including increased pH and activities of urease and acid phosphatase, and decreased availability of Cd and nitrate and activity of nitrate reductase. Furthermore, flooding increased rhizosphere bacteria community diversity (including richness and evenness) and changed their community structure. Denitrifying bacteria (Clostridiales, Azoarcus and Pseudomonas), toxic metal resistant microorganisms (Rhodosporillaceae, Rhizobiales and Geobacter) were enriched in the rhizosphere under flooding conditions, and the plant growth-promoting taxa (Sphingomonadaceae) were preferentially colonized in the high accumulator (HA) rhizosphere region. These results indicated that flooding treatments result in biochemical and microbiological changes in soil, especially in the rhizosphere and reduced the availability of Cd and nitrate to plants, thus decreasing their uptake by water spinach.

Most fly isolates were the same predominant pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types found in feedlot surface manure and leafy greens, suggesting a possible role for flies in transmitting E. coli O157:H7 to the leafy greens. However, further research is needed to clarify this role and to determine set-back distances between cattle production facilities and produce crops that will reduce the risk for pathogen contamination by challenging mechanisms like flies."

Biofilm-associated pathogens are relatively resistant to chemical treatments, but little is known about their response to irradiation. Leaves of Romaine lettuce and baby spinach were dip inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 and stored at 4 degrees C for various times (0, 24, 48, 72 h) to allow biofilms to form. After each time, leaves were treated with either a 3-min wash with a sodium hypochlorite solution (0, 300, or 600 ppm) or increasing doses of irradiation (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1 kGy). Viable bacteria were recovered and enumerated. Chlorine washes were generally only moderately effective, and resulted in maximal reductions of 1.3 log CFU/g for baby spinach and 1.8 log CFU/g for Romaine. Increasing time in storage prior to chemical treatment had no effect on spinach, and had an inconsistent effect on 600 ppm applied to Romaine. Allowing time for formation of biofilm-like aggregations reduced the efficacy of irradiation. D(10) values (the dose required for a 1 log reduction) significantly increased with increasing storage time, up to 48 h postinoculation. From 0 h of storage, D(10) increased from 0.19 kGy to a maximum of 0.40 to 0.43 kGy for Romaine and 0.52 to 0.54 kGy for spinach. SEM showed developing biofilms on both types of leaves during storage. Bacterial colonization of the stomata was extensive on spinach, but not on Romaine. These results indicate that the protection of bacteria on the leaf surface by biofilm formation and stomatal colonization can reduce the antimicrobial efficacy of irradiation on leafy green vegetables."

With the mean concentrations of As, Cd, Pb and Cr being 0.24, 0.20, 0.32 and 1.28 mg kg-1, the As, Cd and Pb concentrations were within the limits of 0.2-0.5 mg kg-1 based on Chinese National Standards and the WHO/FAO, but Cr concentration was 2.6-times greater than the limit of 0.5 mg kg-1. Based on an in vitro bioaccessibility assay of the Solubility Bioaccessibility Research Consortium (SBRC), As bioaccessibility was the lowest at 11% while those of Cd, Pb and Cr were much greater at 68-87%. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of metals through cabbage ingestion was similar for children and adults. Among the four metals, only Cr's EDI at 2.29-1.87 exceeded 1 based on total and bioaccessible concentrations. The high Cr concentration at 1.28 mg kg-1 coupled with its high bioaccessibility at 67.5% makes Cr of concern in cabbage. However, human gastrointestinal cells exposed to the gastric digesta with high bioaccessible heavy metals and risky EDI, showed no obvious cytotoxicity, indicating that existing models based on total or bioaccessible heavy metals may overestimate their human health risk. Taken together, to accurately assess the human health risk of heavy metals in cabbage, both total/bioaccessible concentrations and the gastrointestinal cell responses should be considered."

Plants were grown in mesocosms under different temperature conditions (24°C and 30°C) and the growing substrate was inoculated using contaminated irrigation water (7logCFU/mL). E. coli O157:H7 could be internalized in the leaves of the tested leafy vegetables through the roots and persist up to the harvesting time with negligible differences between 24°C and 30°C. Significant decreases in pathogen titers were observed over time in the growing substrate on which the plants grew, until the last sampling time. In contrast, L. monocytogenes internalized and persisted only in lettuce mesocosms at 24°C. Neither pathogen was observed in basil leaves. Similarly, in basil growing substrates, enteric bacteria were undetectable at the end of the experiments, suggesting that basil plants may produce and release antimicrobial compounds active against both bacteria in root exudates. These results suggest that enteric bacteria are able to persist within baby salad leaves up to market representing a risk for consumer's health."

Recent studies of the food microbiome have revealed the vast genetic diversity of bacteria associated with fresh produce. However, no work has been done to apply metagenomic methods to tackle viruses associated with fresh produce for addressing food safety. Thus, there is a little knowledge about the presence and diversity of viruses associated with fresh produce from farm-to-fork. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed viruses on commercial romaine and iceberg lettuces in fields and a produce distribution center using a shotgun metagenomic sequencing targeting both RNA and DNA viruses. Commercial lettuce harbors an immense assemblage of viruses that infect a wide range of hosts. As expected, plant pathogenic viruses dominated these communities. Sequences of rotaviruses and picobirnaviruses were also identified in both field-harvest and retail lettuce samples, suggesting an emerging foodborne transmission threat that has yet to be fully recognized. The identification of human and animal viruses in lettuce samples in the field emphasizes the importance of preventing viral contamination on leafy greens starting at the field. Although there are still some inherent experimental and bioinformatics challenges in applying viral metagenomic approaches for food safety testing, this work will facilitate further application of this unprecedented deep sequencing method to food samples."

The estimated daily intake value of each TM estimated for each crop was found to be below the tolerable daily intake value. The target hazard quotients of all TMs in all crops did not exceed the acceptable non-carcinogenic risk level. However, hazard index (HI) value (1.57) in tomato was found to be above the threshold value of 1, indicating non-carcinogenic risks for consumers due to the intake of combined TMs in tomato. The THQ values of As, Co and Pb contributed 46.4%, 24.5% and 16.4% of the HI value of tomato, respectively. High daily consumption amount of tomato likely resulted in high HI value.

These techniques, based on Monte Carlo Risk Assessment (MCRA) software and on the programming language R, were employed for the risk assessment of cadmium for Austrian adults, enabling the validation and the critical comparison of the two approaches. Harmonisation and optimisation of procedures, refinement of exposure assessment skills and confidence in the results were the main benefits. Data amount and validity were identified as critical parameters, influencing the precision of the results. Cadmium was selected as a case study due to its toxicological properties, its ubiquitous presence in food and the availability of Austrian occurrence data. Similar exposure and risk estimates were generated through MCRA and R in alternative optimistic and pessimistic exposure scenarios, suggesting low levels of concern, except for vegetarians, whose upper tail exposures are close to the established Tolerable Weekly Intake. However, as occurrence data gaps have been identified as the major element of uncertainty, the estimated exposure and risk levels are characterised as underestimated.

This study applies a physiology based extraction technique (PBET) to mimic digestion of these vegetables to determine the fraction of essential (Fe and Zn) and non-essential elements (Cd, Cr and Pb) that are made available for absorption after ingestion. Prior to the application of the PBET, the vegetables were cooked adopting indigenous Swazi cooking methods. Cooking mobilized most of the metals out of the vegetable mass, and the final substrate concentrations are: raw > cooked > supernatant for all the metals, and the order of average metal leaching was: Pb (82.2%) >Cr (70.6%) >Zn (67.5%) >Fe (60.2%) >Cd (53.6%). This meant that the bioavailable concentrations are significantly lower than in the original vegetable mass, if only the solid mass is consumed. Bioaccessibility was higher in the gastric tract than in the intestinal phases of the PBET for all the metals in all the vegetables. Risk assessment protocols employed on the non-essential elements (Cr, Cd and Pb) showed that the associated risks of ingesting metal contaminated vegetables are higher for children, than they are for adults, based on the target hazard quotient (THQ) index. However, the overall health risk associated with ingestion of these metals is low, for both children and adults, based on the HR index. Conclusively, this study expounds on the nutritional and risk benefits associated with ingesting naturally grown vegetables."

High exposure to these metals can result in adverse health effects such as neurodegenerative diseases. In non-occupationally exposed subjects, diet is the primary source of exposure. In this study, we aimed at estimating dietary aluminum and tin intake in an Italian adult population. We measured aluminum and tin concentrations through inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry in 908 food samples. We also estimated dietary intake of these two metals, by using a validated semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire administered to 719 subjects (319 men and 400 women) recruited from the general population of the Emilia Romagna region, Northern Italy. We found the highest aluminum levels in legumes, sweets, and cereals, while the highest tin levels were in sweets, meat and seafood. The estimated median daily dietary intake of aluminum was 4.1 mg/day (Interquartile range - IQR: 3.3-5.2), with a major contribution from beverages (28.6%), cereals (16.9%), and leafy vegetables (15.2%). As for tin, we estimated a median intake of 66.8 μg/day (IQR: 46.7-93.7), with a major contribution from vegetables (mainly tomatoes) (24.9%), fruit (15.5%), aged cheese (12.2%), and processed meat (10.4%).

These mechanisms and consumer demand determine the storage and delay times of products. The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess the difference between simulating supply chain logistics (MOD) and assuming fixed storage times (FIX) in microbial risk estimation for the supply chain of fresh-cut leafy green vegetables destined for working-canteen salad bars. The results of the FIX model were previously published (E. Franz, S. O. Tromp, H. Rijgersberg, and H. J. van der Fels-Klerx, J. Food Prot. 73:274-285, 2010). Pathogen growth was modeled using stochastic discrete-event simulation of the applied logistics concept. The public health effects were assessed by conducting an exposure assessment and risk characterization. The relative growths of Escherichia coli O157 (17%) and Salmonella enterica (15%) were identical in the MOD and FIX models. In contrast, the relative growth of Listeria monocytogenes was considerably higher in the MOD model (1,156%) than in the FIX model (194%). The probability of L. monocytogenes infection in The Netherlands was higher in the MOD model (5.18×10(-8)) than in the FIX model (1.23×10(-8)). The risk of listeriosis-induced fetal mortality in the perinatal population increased from 1.24×10(-4) (FIX) to 1.66×10(-4) (MOD). Modeling the probabilistic nature of supply chain logistics is of additional value for microbial risk assessments regarding psychrotrophic pathogens in food products for which time and temperature are the postharvest preventive measures in guaranteeing food safety."

However, no correlation between E. coli and any specific waterborne pathogen(s) has been reported. We conducted this monitoring study in an agricultural watershed to (i) evaluate spatial and temporal fluctuations in E. coli populations and virulence genes associated with pathogenic E. coli and (ii) investigate whether a relationship could be established between E. coli and virulence genes. The virulence genes targeted for analysis were the eae and stx genes, encoding for intimin and Shiga-like toxins, respectively; they were detected with PCR methods. E. coli concentrations and eae and stx prevalence varied both spatially and temporally. In general, both were higher in agricultural than in forested areas and were higher in the summer and fall seasons than in winter. The eae and stx genes were prevalent throughout the watershed. However, in the absence of actual isolates, no conclusions could be drawn regarding the prevalence of specific pathogenic E. coli. No correlation was observed between E. coli concentrations and virulence genes; lower E. coli concentrations were not necessarily associated with decreased prevalence of eae and stx genes. These results suggest that the LGMA standards might not adequately address the issue of waterborne contamination, and that alternative criteria might be required."

No STEC was isolated. In all, 10% of samples were positive for E. coli: 6% of leafy greens, 18% of irrigation water, 10% of soil, 38% of sediment, and 27% of compost samples. Farming system was not a significant factor for levels of E. coli or aerobic mesophiles on leafy greens but was a significant factor for total coliforms (TC) (P < 0.001), with higher counts from organic farm samples. Growing season was a factor for aerobic mesophiles on leafy greens (P = 0.004), with higher levels in fall than in spring. Water source was a factor for all indicator bacteria (P < 0.001), and end-of-line groundwater had marginally higher TC counts than source samples (P = 0.059).

Based on first-order Monte Carlo simulations, the average number of cases per year in The Netherlands associated the consumption leafy greens in salads from salad bars was 166, 187, and 0.3 for E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, and L. monocytogenes, respectively. The ranges of the average number of annual cases as estimated by second-order Monte Carlo simulation (with prevalence and number of visitors as uncertain variables) were 42 to 551 for E. coli O157:H7, 81 to 281 for Salmonella, and 0.1 to 0.9 for L. monocytogenes. This study included an integration of modeling pathogen growth in the supply chain of fresh leafy vegetables destined for restaurant salad bars using software designed to model and design logistics and modeling the public health effects using probabilistic risk assessment software."

The Fresh Express Produce Safety Research Initiative was launched in 2007 with $2 million in unrestricted funds from industry and independent direction and oversight from a scientific advisory panel consisting of nationally recognized food safety experts from academia and government agencies. The program had two main objectives: (i) to fund rigorous, innovative, and multidisciplinary research addressing the safety of lettuce, spinach, and other leafy greens and (ii) to share research findings as widely and quickly as possible to support the development of advanced safeguards within the fresh-cut produce industry. Sixty-five proposals were submitted in response to a publicly announced request for proposals and were competitively evaluated. Nine research projects were funded to examine underlying factors involved in Escherichia coli O157:H7 contamination of lettuce, spinach, and other leafy greens and potential strategies for preventing the spread of foodborne pathogens. Results of the studies, published in the Journal of Food Protection, help to identify promising directions for future research into potential sources and entry points of contamination and specific factors associated with harvesting, processing, transporting, and storing produce that allow contaminants to persist and proliferate. The program provides a model for leveraging the strengths of industry, academia, and government to address high-priority issues quickly and directly through applied research. This model can be productively extended to other pathogens and other leafy and nonleafy produce."

We determined the limit of STEC detection by qPCR to be 30 CFU/reaction, which is equivalent to 105 CFU/ml in the enrichment. By using Oxford Nanopore's EPI2ME WIMP workflow and de novo assembly with Flye followed by taxon classification with a k-mer analysis software (Kraken2), E. coli O157:H7 could be detected at 103 CFU/ml (68 reads) and a complete fragmented E. coli O157:H7 metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) was obtained at 105-108 CFU/ml. Using a custom script to extract the E. coli reads, a completely closed MAG was obtained at 107-108 CFU/ml and a complete, fragmented MAG was obtained at 105-106 CFU/ml. In silico virulence detection for E. coli MAGs for 105-108 CFU/ml showed that the virulotype was indistinguishable from the spiked E. coli O157:H7 strain. We further identified the bacterial species in the un-spiked enrichment, including antimicrobial resistance genes, which could have important implications to food safety.

Separate lettuce plants (Lactuca sativa var. capitata) were irrigated with water spiked with Log10 7 cfu/mL of each of the two strains and survival assessed via direct enumeration, enrichment and qPCR. In parallel, individual 20 L water microcosms were spiked with Log10 7 cfu/mL of the individual strains and sampled at similar time points.

Opportunistically, the survival and distribution of naturally contaminating pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 (EcO157), in a single packaged lot following commercial postharvest handling and washing, was also evaluated. From the main study outcomes, differences in the applied inoculum dose of 100-fold, resulted in indistinguishable population densities of approximately Log 1.1 CFU g-1 by 14 days post-inoculation (DPI). Composite leaf samples of 150 g and the inclusion of the spinach petiole resulted in the greatest numerical sensitivity of detection of attEcO157 when compared to 25 and 150 g samples without petioles (P < 0.05). Differences in population density and protected-site survival and potential leaf internalization were observed between growing seasons and locations in California (P < 0.05). A Double Weibull model best described and identified two distinct populations with different inactivation rates of the inoculated attEcO157. Linear die-off rates varied between 0.14 and 0.29 Log/Day irrespective of location. Detection of EcO157- stx1-negative and stx2-positive, resulting from a natural contamination event, was observed in 11 of 26 quarantined commercial units of washed spinach by applying the 150 g sample mass protocol. The capacity to detect EcO157 varied between commercial test kits and non-commercial qPCR. Our findings suggest the need for modifications to routine pathogen sampling protocols employed for lot acceptance of spinach and other leafy greens."

Less is known about health risks that arise under these conditions. This study aimed to discuss the pollution of Cd with natural sources, and to investigate the concentration of Cd in food crops and the urine of inhabitants in an area of southwestern China. The results showed that the arable soils are moderately contaminated by Cd (I(geo)=1.51) relative to the local background, with a high ecological risk (Er=218). The chemical fractions of Cd in soils with natural sources are probably controlled by parent materials and mostly in residual phase. The average Cd concentrations were 0.68 mg kg(-1) (fresh weight) in local vegetables, 0.04 mg kg(-1) in rice, and 0.14 μg L(-1) in water. Leafy vegetable tends to accumulate more Cd than the other crops. The calculated Target Hazard Quotient (THQ) had a much higher value (4.33) for Cd, suggesting that Cd represents a significant potential risk to the local population. The urinary Cd concentrations (mean at 3.92 μg L(-1) for male and 4.85 μg L(-1) for female) of inhabitants in the study area were significantly higher (p<0.05) than those from the control area (mean at 0.8 μg L(-1) for male and 0.42 μg L(-1) for female). Male and female test subjects had similar urinary Cd levels (p>0.05), but age seemed to lead to an increase in Cd in the urine. These findings show that naturally-occurring Cd in local soils is taken up appreciably by local food crops, and that dietary exposure of Cd through vegetable ingestion is a major exposure pathway for local populations, and a potential risk to public health in the study area."

Nevertheless fresh leafy green vegetables and their RTE salads are recognized as a source of food poisoning outbreaks in many parts of the world. However, this increased proportion of outbreaks cannot be completely explained by increased consumption and enhanced surveillance of them. Both in Europe and in the USA, recent foodborne illness outbreaks have revealed links between some pathogens and some leafy green vegetables such as mostly lettuces and spinaches and their RTE salads since fresh leafy green vegetables carry the potential risk of microbiological contamination due to the usage of untreated irrigation water, inappropriate organic fertilizers, wildlife or other sources that can occur anywhere from the farm to the fork such as failure during harvesting, handling, processing and packaging. Among a wide range of pathogens causing foodborne illnesses, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp. , and Listeria monocytogenes are the most common pathogens that contaminate leafy green vegetables. Children, the elderly, pregnant women and immunocompromised people are the most at risk for developing complications from foodborne illness as a result of eating contaminated leafy greens or their RTE salads. These outbreaks are mostly restaurant associated or they sometimes spread across several countries by international trade routes. This review summarizes current observations concerning the contaminated leafy green vegetables and their RTE salads as important vehicles for the transmission of some foodborne pathogens to humans."

The aim of this work was to investigate the fate of E. coli O157:H7 on the phyllosphere of lettuce under low temperature and to evaluate the potential hazard of viable but nonculturable (VBNC) cells induced under such stressful conditions. First, we studied the survival of six bacterial strains following prolonged storage in water at low temperature (4°C) and selected two strains with different nonculturable responses for the construction of E. coli O157:H7 Tn7gfp transformants in order to quantitatively assess the occurrence of human pathogens on the plant surface. Under a suboptimal growth temperature (16°C), both E. coli O157:H7 strains maintained culturability on lettuce leaves, but under more stressful conditions (8°C), the bacterial populations evolved toward the VBNC state. The strain-dependent nonculturable response was more evident in the experiments with different inoculum doses (10(9) and 10(6) E. coli O157:H7 bacteria per g of leaf) when strain BRMSID 188 lost culturability after 15 days and strain ATCC 43895 lost culturability within 7 days, regardless of the inoculum dose. However, the number of cells entering the VBNC state in high-cell-density inoculum (approximately 55%) was lower than in low-cell-density inoculum (approximately 70%). We recorded the presence of verotoxin for 3 days in samples that contained a VBNC population of 4 to 5 log(10) cells but did not detect culturable cells. These findings indicate that E. coli O157:H7 VBNC cells are induced on lettuce plants, and this may have implications regarding food safety."

Shredded lettuce was inoculated with 5.58 and 3.98 log CFU E. coli O157:H7 per g and stored at 4 and 15°C, respectively, for up to 10 days. Lettuce was packaged under treatment A (modified atmosphere packaging conditions used for commercial fresh-cut produce, in gas-permeable film with N(2)), treatment B (near-ambient air atmospheric conditions in a gas-permeable film with microperforations), and treatment C (high-CO(2) and low-O(2) conditions in a gas-impermeable film). E. coli O157:H7 populations from each treatment were determined by enumeration of numbers on MacConkey agar containing nalidixic acid. RNA was extracted from packaged lettuce for analysis of expression of virulence factor genes stx(2), eae, ehxA, iha, and rfbE. E. coli O157:H7 populations on lettuce at 4°C under all treatments decreased, but most considerably so under treatment B over 10 days. At 15°C, E. coli O157:H7 populations increased by at least 2.76 log CFU/g under all treatments. At 15°C, expression of eae and iha was significantly greater under treatment B than it was under treatments A and C on day 3. Similarly, treatment B promoted significantly higher expression of stx(2), eae, ehxA, and rfbE genes on day 10, compared with treatments A and C at 15°C.

Furthermore, predictive models were proposed to describe survival patterns shown by both pathogens in the different substrates. E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. could be recovered until 192 and 168h, respectively from surfaces soiled with chard, red cabbage, iceberg lettuce and romaine lettuce.

Levels of PCDD/F in municipal sewage sludge ranged from 0.0005 to 8300 pg toxic equivalents (TEQ)/g. Background levels in soil ranged from 0.003 to 186 pg TEQ/g. In sludge-amended soils, levels of PCDD/F ranged from 1.4 to 15 pg TEQ/g. Studies that measured levels before and after sludge treatment showed an increase in soil concentration after treatment. Relationships between PCDD/F levels in soil and resulting concentrations in plants were very weakly positive for unpeeled root crops, leafy vegetables, tree fruits, hay, and herbs. Somewhat stronger relationships were observed for plants of the cucumber family. In all cases, large increases in soil concentration were required to achieve a measurable increase in plant contamination. A considerably stronger positive relationship was observed between PCDD/F in feed and resulting levels in cattle tissue, suggesting bioaccumulation. Although PCDD/Fs are excreted in milk, no association was found between feed contamination and levels of PCDD/Fs measured in milk. There is a paucity of realistic data describing the potential for entry of PCDD/Fs into the food supply via sewage sludge. Currently available data suggest that sewage sludge application to land used for most crops would not increase human exposure. However, the use of sludge on land used to graze animals appears likely to result in increased human exposure to PCDD/F."

Principal component analysis was used to group elements having the same sources irrespective of their geographical locations. Cd, Co and Cr were not detected in the leaves from the western region. Concentrations of As and Pb were above maximum permissible limits in both regions, while Ayegunle and Bida (in the northern region) had the highest concentrations of Cd.

Results showed that element contents in soils decreased in the order of Zn > Pb > Cr > Cu > Cd. The high geo-accumulation indexes (Igeo) showed that cultivated soils near mine were practically polluted by Cd, Pb and Zn. The contents of Cd, Cr and Pb in crop/vegetables samples were significantly higher than the maximum permissible standard set by China. The potential health risk assessments among local residents were evaluated by the hazard index (HI), the total carcinogenic risk (TCR), the target hazard quotient (THQ) and carcinogenic risk (CR), respectively. The results showed that diet was the dominant exposure pathway. The results of HI for adult and child were 6.21 and 6.08, respectively. TCR values of Cr and Cd were more than 10-4. The THQ decreased in the following order: Cd > Pb > Cu > Zn > Cr. Among all kinds of crop/vegetables, leafy-vegetables were the major source of Cd and Pb exposure, root-vegetable were the important factors for Cu and Zn exposure, but tuber-vegetable were the factors for Cr exposure. The contents of Cd and Pb in human scalp hairs near Huodehong mine were higher than that in S20km area. Females possessed a higher risk for Cd, Cr, Cu and Pb exposure than males in study area. Significant differences between ages were found for Cd, Cu and Pb (p < 0.01). This study provided a powerful basis for the coordination of local environmental protection and economic sustainable development and assessing chemical elements risk to human health."

Bacteria can strongly attach to a food surface or internalize within the matrix, making their isolation extremely difficult. Traditional methods of separating bacteria from food routinely involve stomaching, blending, and shaking. However, these methods may not be efficient at removing all the bacteria from complex matrices. Here, we investigate the benefits of using enzyme digestion followed by immunomagnetic separation to isolate Salmonella from spinach and lettuce. Enzymatic digestion using pectinase and cellulase was able to break down the structure of the leafy green vegetables, resulting in the detachment and release of Salmonella from the leaves. Immunomagnetic separation of Salmonella from the liquefied sample allowed an additional separation step to achieve a more pure sample without leaf debris that may benefit additional downstream applications. We have investigated the optimal combination of pectinase and cellulase for the digestion of spinach and lettuce to improve sample detection yields. The concentrations of enzymes used to digest the leaves were confirmed to have no significant effect on the viability of the inoculated Salmonella. Results reported that the recovery of the Salmonella from the produce after enzyme digestion of the leaves was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than traditional sample preparation methods to separate bacteria (stomaching and manually shaking). The results demonstrate the potential for use of enzyme digestion prior to separation can improve the efficiency of bacteria separation and increase the likelihood of detecting pathogens in the final detection assay."

In the present study we have examined the incidence (percentage of microscopic fields harboring ≥ 1 GFP-tagged bacteria) of Salmonella Typhimurium on the surface and underneath the epidermis in detached leaves of seven vegetables and fresh herbs. The incidence of internalized Salmonella varied considerably among the different plants. The highest incidence was observed in iceberg lettuce (81 ± 16%) and arugula leaves (88 ± 16%), while romaine (16 ± 16%) and red-lettuce (20 ± 15%), showed significantly lower incidence (P < 0.05).

Internalization of Salmonella in iceberg lettuce largely varied (0-100%) through a 2 year survey, with a higher incidence occurring mainly in the summer. These results imply that Salmonella internalization occurs in several leafy vegetables and fresh herbs, other than iceberg lettuce, yet the level of internalization largely varies among plants and within the same crop. Since internalized bacteria may evade disinfection, it is of great interest to identify plants which are more susceptible to bacterial internalization, as well as plant and environmental factors that affect internalization."

To accommodate diverse environmental and hydrological pathways, existing QMRAs were integrated with novel and simplistic climate and field-level submodels. The model indicated that direct animal contact presents the greatest risk of illness per exposure event during the high pathogen shedding period. However, when accounting for the frequency of exposure, using a high-risk exposure-receptor profile, consumption of ground beef was associated with the greatest risk of illness. Additionally, the model was used to evaluate the efficacy of hypothetical interventions affecting one or more exposure routes; concurrent evaluation of multiple routes allowed for the assessment of the combined effect of preharvest interventions across exposure pathways-which may have been previously underestimated-as well as the assessment of the effect of additional downstream interventions. This analysis represents a step towards a full evaluation of the risks associated with multiple exposure pathways; future incorporation of variability associated with environmental parameters and human behaviors would allow for a comprehensive assessment of the relative contribution of exposure pathways at the population level."

In this study, we conducted big data mining of 31,342 soil and vegetable samples to examine the influence of soil properties (soil pH, SOM, CEC, Zn and Mn content) on the accumulation of Cd in root, solanaceous, and leafy vegetables in Hunan Province, China. Specifically, the Cd accumulation capability was in the following order: leafy vegetables > root vegetables > solanaceous vegetables. The soil property thresholds for safety production in vegetables were determined by establishing nonlinear models between Cd bioaccumulation factor (BCF) and the individual soil property, and were 6.5 (pH), 30.0 g/kg (SOM), 13.0 cmol/kg (CEC), 100-140 mg/kg (Zn), and 300-400 mg/kg (Mn). When soil property values were higher than the thresholds, Cd accumulation in vegetables tended to be stable. Prediction models showed that pH and soil Zn were the leading factors influencing Cd accumulation in root vegetables, explaining 87% of the variance; pH, SOM, soil Zn and Mn explained 68% of the variance in solanaceous vegetables; pH and SOM were the main contributors in leafy vegetables, explaining 65% of the variance. Further, variance partitioning analysis (VPA) revealed that the interaction effect of the corresponding key soil properties contributed mostly to BCF. Meanwhile, partial least squares (PLS) path modeling was employed to analyze the path and the interactive effects of soil properties on Cd BCF. pH and SOM were found to be the biggest two players affecting BCF in PLS-models, and the most substantial interactive influence paths of soil properties on BCF were different among the three types of vegetables."

The empirical models developed in this study explained the combined effects of soil properties and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-extractable Cd content on Cd phytoavailability to leafy vegetables. The Cd accumulation in celery, pak choi, and amaranth was quantitatively predicted by measurement of DTPA-extractable soil Cd and soil pH, organic matter, cation exchange capacity and clay content. For predicting Cd accumulation, the DTPA-extractable Cd, pH and clay content had a major influence in lettuce; and for water spinach, the DTPA-extractable Cd, pH, and cation exchange capacity had a major influence. Soil DTPA-extractable Cd was suitable to be used as Cd thresholds in soils cultivating celery, amaranth, pak choi, lettuce, and water spinach, with values of 0.24, 0.13, 0.23, 0.32, and 0.37 mg kg-1, respectively.

Typically, leafy vegetables are low in calories and fat, are great sources of vitamins, protein, dietary fibre and minerals (including iron, calcium, and nitrates), and are rich in phytochemicals. To counter the impact of pests on vegetables, a broad variety of pesticides are used. Because of their large surface areas, leafy vegetables are expected to have high residual pesticide levels. As such, a sound analytical approach is needed to detect and quantify residue levels that are equal to or lower than the maximum residue limits, thus rendering the products safe for consumption. Overall, leafy vegetables consumed raw (after a tap water wash only), boiled or steamed contribute 2% of total vegetable consumption globally, and they might have a comparatively greater influence on health than cereal ingestion. Consequently, in this review paper, we highlight the importance of leafy vegetables, the pesticides that are commonly used on them and various analytical techniques, including sample preparation, extraction, clean-up and final detection. The effects on dissipation patterns, pre-harvest residue limits and safety/risks imposed by various pesticides are also reviewed and discussed. In conclusion, environmentally friendly extraction methods coupled with high-throughput techniques with greater reproducibility and lower uncertainty are needed for quantifying residues in leafy vegetables at very low concentrations. Commercial and household food preparation, such as washing, peeling, blanching and cooking are effective in removing most of the pesticide residues that are loosely attached on vegetables."

We estimated the bioconcentration factors (BCF) in the edible plant tissues for PAH using crop-specific models for leafy vegetables, root vegetables, potatoes and tree fruits. The estimates were compared with results from the empirical regression of Travis and Arms (T&A) for above-ground vegetation. The comparison shows that the use of crop-specific models resulted in lower BCF values of pollutant concentrations in fruits, potatoes and leafy vegetables, particularly for the heavier PAH (M>220 g mol(-1)). However, the crop-specific models yielded higher BCF values for root vegetables (carrot) and leafy vegetables if the attached soil particles (1%) were considered. Consequently, the average daily intake of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) by an adult Czech through fruits and vegetables was estimated with the crop-specific models to be 190 ng BaP per person, and 460 ng BaP per person with the T&A regression, for a soil concentration of 1 mg BaP kg(-1) soil (wet wt. ). A virtually safe oral dose of BaP, as a marker of the carcinogenic PAH, was suggested by a European expert commission to be below 4.2 to 35 ng per person and day. Using these figures, an acceptable soil concentration of BaP was estimated for the purpose of crop production to be below 0.02 or 0.18 mg kg(-1) (wet wt. ) with the crop-specific models, and below 0.01 or 0.08 mg kg(-1) (wet wt. ) with T&A.

The EHEC O157:H7 strains used were Nal(R) mutants of EK27, ATCC 43895, and 472. Exponentially growing cells from tryptic soy (TS) broth cultures were spot inoculated on leaves and dried. EHEC cells were placed at low, medium, and high inoculum levels (10(4), 10(5), and 10(6) CFU/mL, respectively). Appropriate controls, BEC8 (approx. 10(6) PFU/leaf), and TC (0.5% v/v) were applied on treated leaves. The leaves were incubated at 4, 8, 23, and 37 °C in Petri dishes with moistened filter papers. EHEC survival was determined using standard plate count on nalidixic acid (50 μg/mL) Sorbitol MacConkey agar. No survivors were detected when both leaves were treated with BEC8 or TC individually at low inoculum levels after 24 h at 23 and 37 °C. When the EHEC inoculum size increased and/or incubation temperature decreased, the efficacy of BEC8 and TC decreased. However, when the two treatments were combined, no survivors were detected after 10 min at all temperatures and inoculum levels on both leafy greens. These results indicated that the BEC8/TC combination was highly effective against EHEC on both leafy greens. This combination could potentially be used as an antimicrobial to inactivate EHEC O157:H7 and reduce their incidence in the food chain."

Overall, Arcobacter spp. were detected in 45.8% of food samples, and the recovery rate of protocol B (37.8%) was significantly higher than that of protocol A (30.7%) (p < 0.05). Refrigerated chicken gizzard samples showed the highest detection rate (100%), followed by refrigerated chicken wing (79.5%), intestine (77.3%), neck skin (63.3%), pork (55.6%), frozen chicken legs (5.0%), and leafy green vegetables (4.4%) (p < 0.05). All isolates from chicken and leafy green vegetables were identified as A. butzleri, whereas A. cryaerophilus and A. skirrowii were mainly detected in pork. Most samples (95.8%) harbored more than one of nine putative virulence factors (cadF, ciaB, cj1349, hecA, hecB, mviN, pldA, irgA, and tlyA), and 91.3% harbored more than two. Isolates harboring all nine putative virulence genes were obtained from 1.9% of samples: five pork and one chicken. This study provides comprehensive and de facto evidence regarding prevalence of an emerging pathogen, Arcobacter spp. , in various foods, along with their virulence potential. The results justify further research with respect to their role in food safety."

It is not clear whether the accumulation of heavy metals in the edible parts of leafy vegetables in greenhouses is also affected by atmospheric deposition. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted to explore characteristics and health risk assessment of cadmium, lead, and arsenic accumulation in leafy vegetables planted in a greenhouse using six types of common leafy vegetables (spinach, leaf lettuce, lettuce, pakchoi, Chrysanthemum coronarium, and fennel) in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The results showed that C. coronarium, pakchoi, and spinach are the leafy vegetables with a low accumulation of Cd, Pb, and As, respectively. Fennel is the leafy vegetable with a low accumulation of Cd and Pb. In the greenhouse, Pb concentrations in PM2.5 were 42.6 and 8.4 times of Cd and As, respectively. Moreover, PM2.5-Pb contributed on average 36.5% to the edible parts of six kinds of leafy vegetables, which indicated that the Cd, Pb, and As accumulated in leafy vegetables were mainly derived from the soil. Meanwhile, the concentrations of Cd, Pb, and As in the edible parts of vegetables did not exceed the safety limitations of three heavy metals (GB 2762-2017), and Pb accumulation in leafy vegetables does not pose a health risk to humans. However, Cd in the leafy vegetables could threaten the health of adults and children, except for the intake of fennel. Conversely, As in the C. coronarium could threaten the health of adults and children."

The toxic equivalent quantity of PAHs in soil ranged from 7 to 202 μg/kg d. w. , with an average of 41 μg/kg d. w. , which exceeded the agricultural/horticultural soil acceptance criteria for New Zealand. However, the cancer risk level posed by combined direct ingestion, dermal contact, inhalation of soil particles, and inhalation of surface soil vapor met the rigorous international criteria (1 × 10(-6)). The concentration of total PAHs was (1052 ± 73) μg/kg d. w. in vegetation (mean ± standard error). The cancer risks posed by ingestion of vegetation ranged from 2×10-5 to 2 × 10(-4) with an average of 1.66 × 10(-4), which was higher than international excess lifetime risk limits for carcinogens (1 × 10(-4)). The geochemical indices indicated that the PAHs in soil and vegetables were mainly from vehicle and crude oil combustion. Both the total PAHs in vegetation and bioconcentration factor for total PAHs (the ratio of total PAHs in vegetation to total PAHs in soil) increased with increasing pH as well as decreasing sand in soil. The total variation in distribution of PAHs in vegetation explained by those in soil reached 98% in RDA, which was statistically significant based on Monte Carlo permutation.

Consequently, reports of ready-to-eat fruit and vegetable related disease outbreak occurrences have increased substantially in recent years, and information regarding these events is often not readily available. Identifying the nature and source of microbial contamination of these foodstuffs is critical for developing appropriate mitigation measures to be implemented by food producers. This review aimed to identify the foodstuffs most susceptible to microbial contamination and the microorganisms responsible for disease outbreaks from information available in peer-reviewed scientific publications. A total of 571 outbreaks were identified from 1980 to 2016, accounting for 72,855 infections and 173 deaths. Contaminated leafy green vegetables were responsible for 51.7% of reported outbreaks. Contaminated soft fruits caused 27.8% of infections. Pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella, norovirus, and hepatitis A accounted for the majority of cases. Large outbreaks resulted in particular biases such as the observation that contaminated sprouted plants caused 31.8% of deaths. Where known, contamination mainly occurred via contaminated seeds, water, and contaminated food handlers. There is a critical need for standardized datasets regarding all aspects of disease outbreaks, including how foodstuffs are contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms. Providing food business operators with this knowledge will allow them to implement better strategies to improve safety and quality of fresh produce."

Questions remain concerning the ability of these pathogens to become internalized within lettuce and spinach tissues. An effective validated surface disinfection method for lettuce is needed before factors affecting internalization of pathogens can be studied. The objective of this study was to develop a surface disinfection method for lettuce leaves and roots. Iceberg lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. ) leaves cut into pieces (3 by 3 cm) and lettuce roots were inoculated by immersing in suspensions of five-strain mixtures of green fluorescent protein-labeled E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, or Listeria monocytogenes at populations of 7 to 8 log CFU/ml for 10 min at 20 +/- 1 degrees C. Inoculated samples were placed in a laminar flow biosafety cabinet for 30 min before treating with disinfectants. Thirteen surface disinfection methods were compared for their efficacy in killing E. coli O157:H7 on lettuce leaf and root surfaces. E. coli O157:H7 initially at 5.8 or 6.8 log CFU/leaf piece or root was not detected by enumeration (< 0.6 log CFU per leaf piece) on samples treated for 20 min with 10,000 microg/ml sodium hypochlorite (NaHCIO) or in solutions containing ethanol and mercuric chloride (HgCl2). With all other methods, E. coli O157:H7 populations ranged from 2.8 to 4.4 CFU per leaf piece or root after treatment. Trends in leaf and root print and enrichment culture results were consistent with enumeration results. Dipping in 80% ethanol for 10 s followed by immersion in 0.1% HgCl2 for 10 min was determined to be the most effective surface disinfection method for inactivating E. coli O157:H7 on lettuce leaves and roots and was also validated for inactivating Salmonella and L. monocytogenes."

The individual and combined applications of PA450 and BC450 significantly reduced the absolute abundance of ARGs by 65.7-81.4% and 47.5-72.9% in the corresponding rhizosphere and bulk soil. However, the co-application showed little synergistic effect, probably due to the counteractive effect of BC450 on the PA450-mitigated soil ARG proliferation, resulted from the promoted soil bacterial growth and/or adsorption of antimicrobial components of PA450 by BC450. The decreased abundances of mobile genetic element intI1 and Tn916/1545 in the PA450 treatments demonstrated the potential of PA450 for weakening horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Furthermore, weakened HGT by individual PA450, lowered availability of heavy metals by individual BC450, and different bacterial community (e. g. , reduced ARGs bacterial host) together with improved soil properties from co-application of PA450 and BC450 all contributed to the reduced ARG level.

Some of the challenges encountered included the time it took to initiate a traceback, limited product-identifying information throughout the supply chain, lack of interoperability in record-keeping systems, and comingling of product from multiple suppliers. These challenges led to time delays in the identification of the farm source of the leafy greens and the inability to identify the root cause of contamination.

The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were calculated, and the human exposures of PFAAs via consumption of the vegetables for different age groups assuming the maximum levels detected in each vegetable and average consumption rates were also estimated. The ΣPFAA levels ranged from 1.67 to 33.5 ng/g dry weight (dw) in the edible parts of all the vegetables, with perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) being the dominant compound with an average contribution of 49% to the ΣPFAA level. The leafy vegetables showed higher ΣPFAA levels (average 8.76 ng/g dw) than the fruit and root vegetables. For all the vegetables, the log10 BAF values of perfluorinated carboxylic acids showed a decreasing trend with increasing chain length, with PFBA having the highest log10 BAF values (average 0.98). Cabbage had higher bioaccumulation of PFBA (log10 BAF 1.24) than other vegetables. For the greenhouse soils and vegetables, the average contribution of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) to ΣPFAA was lower than that in the open field samples, while the contributions of PFBA, PFHxA, PFPeA to ΣPFAA were higher. Irrigation water may be an important source of PFAAs in greenhouse, while for open field vegetables and soils, atmospheric deposition may be an additional contamination pathway. The estimated maximum exposure to PFOA through vegetable consumption for urban preschool children (aged 2-5 years) was 63% of the reference dose set by the European Food Safety Authority. Suggestions are also provided for mitigating the health risks of human exposure to PFAAs."

Efficient methods were developed for releasing and concentrating Cryptosporidium oocysts from leafy vegetables, and sensitive and specific methods were applied for detection. The aims of this review are to discuss the development and optimization of methods applied to elute, concentrate, and detect oocysts from leafy vegetables, to review the prevalence of Cryptosporidium oocysts on fresh leafy vegetables from various parts of the world, and to discuss cryptosporidiosis outbreaks resulting from the consumption of leafy vegetables. Three solutions were used with comparable efficiency to release oocysts from leafy vegetables: 1 M glycine solution; 0.1% Alconox; and filter elution buffer, with an efficiency of 36.2, 72.6, and 44%, respectively. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium oocysts was reported in developed, as well as from developing countries, although simple detection methods were applied. Most of the cryptosporidiosis outbreaks were reported in developed countries, which can be related to the efficient surveillance system. Transmission of infectious pathogens, such as Cryptosporidium, may be facilitated by fresh vegetables, which are imported and transferred from less developed to highly developed countries and consumed uncooked. Monitoring of Cryptosporidium oocysts by sensitive detection methods may enhance measures to prevent transmission by freshly consumed vegetables."

The current study developed a vegetation-advanced multimedia model, SESAMe-Veg, to identify the major uptake pathway of 15 priority PAHs in vegetables and assess the PAHs in edible parts of cabbages and carrots in Jinzhong City, Shanxi Province, China. The model was well evaluated against site- and plant-specific measurements. Edible parts exhibited lower PAH concentrations than the other parts for both vegetables. The estimated concentrations of ΣPAH15 were 79 ng/g in cabbage shoots and 83 ng/g in carrot roots. Higher concentrations were estimated in shoots of the leafy vegetable than in roots of the root vegetable for most PAHs. Although air-shoot is the major transport pathway, 98% was deposition of particles, which was attached outside and could be removed relatively easily by washing. Soils might be the origin of PAHs inside vegetables, especially for lighter PAHs. PYR was more likely to be stored in roots than other congeners. The translocation of PAHs inside vegetables was negligible. Adulthood dietary exposure to local vegetables probably caused a high health risk; however, contributions from consuming cabbages and especially carrots were low. Females generally exhibited slightly higher risks than males of exposure to PAHs in local vegetables. Considering the dominant role of particle deposition, carefully vegetable washing before ingestion could reduce this risk. This study has provided a functional tool to evaluate vegetable contamination by PAHs. CAPSULE: A vegetation-advanced multimedia model of PAHs in different parts of vegetables and other environmental media was developed to evaluate the potential health risk to local populations of different sexes and ages via vegetable ingestion."

Here, we investigated the As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations in four vegetable species from Dongdagou and Xidagou farmlands in Baiyin, Gansu, China. We evaluated the effects of irrigation type (Dongdagou: industrial wastewater; Xidagou: domestic wastewater) and cultivation mode (open field and greenhouse) on the vegetable metal concentration, metal partitioning, soil-to-plant bioconcentration factor (BCF), and the health risk index. All stream waters, soils, and vegetables were found most severely polluted by As and Cd, with higher severity in the industrial-wastewater-irrigated Dongdagou than the domestic-wastewater-irrigated Xidagou. All vegetables had higher or, at least, comparable metal mass allocated in the shoot than in the root. Greenhouse cultivation could reduce metal-ingestion-associated health risks from edible vegetable biomass by decreasing the soil to plant bioaccumulation (BCF) and the metal concentration. This effect was always significant for all vegetables within Xidagou, and for carrot within Dongdagou. This mitigation effect of greenhouse cultivation could be attributed to the metal sorption by a higher level of soil organic matter and faster growth rate over metal uptake rate in greenhouses compared to open fields. Such mitigation effect was, however, insignificant for leafy vegetables within Dongdagou, when much more severely polluted water for irrigation was applied in greenhouses compared to open fields within Dongdagou. The present study highlights greenhouse cultivation as a potential mitigating approach to providing less-polluted vegetables for residents in the severely polluted area in addition to the source pollution control."

Since the influence of consumer practices is essential for their quality and safety, the objective of this study was to analyze the microbiota of RTE products throughout shelf life during simulated household conditions. Products from different companies were analyzed in terms of plate counts, and resealed and unopened packages were compared. High bacterial loads were found, up to a total plate count of 9.6 log10 CFU/g, and Enterobacteriaceae plate counts up to 6.0 CFU/g on the expiration date. The effect of consumer practice varied, thus no conclusions regarding resealed or unopened bags could be drawn. The tested products contained opportunistic pathogens, such as Enterobacter homaechei, Hafnia paralvei and Pantoea agglomerans. Amplicon sequencing revealed that the relative abundance of major taxonomic groups changed during shelf life; Pseudomonadaceae and Xanthomonadaceae decreased, while Flavobacteriaceae and Marinomonadaceae inceased. Inoculation with E. coli CCUG 29300T showed that the relative abundance of Escherichia-Shigella was lower on rocket than on other tested leafy greens. Inoculation with E. coli strain 921 indicate growth at the beginning of shelf-life time, while E. coli 731 increases at the end, seemingly able to adapt to cold storage conditions. The high levels of live microorganisms, the detection of opportunistic pathogens, and the ability of E. coli strains to grow at refrigeration temperature raise concerns and indicate that the shelf life may be shortened to achieve a safer product. Due to variations between products, further studies are needed to define how long the shelf-life of these products should be, to ensure a safe product even at the end of the shelf-life period."

In the United States several commodity-specific guidelines and current and proposed federal rules exist to provide guidance on the application of BSAs as fertilizers to soils, some of which require an interval between the application of manure to soils and the harvest of fruits and vegetables. This review examines the survival, persistence, and regrowth/resuscitation of bacterial pathogens in manure, biosolids, and composts. Moisture, along with climate and the physicochemical properties of soil, manure, or compost, plays a significant role in the ability of pathogens to persist and resuscitate in amended soils. Adaptation of enteric bacterial pathogens to the nonhost environment of soils may also extend their persistence in manure- or compost-amended soils. The presence of antibiotic-resistance genes in soils may also be increased by manure application. Overall, BSAs applied as fertilizers to soils can support the survival and regrowth of pathogens. BSAs should be handled and applied in a manner that reduces the prevalence of pathogens in soils and the likelihood of transfer of food-borne pathogens to fruits and vegetables. This review will focus on two BSAs-raw manure and composted manure (and other feedstocks)-and predominantly on the survival of enteric bacterial pathogens in BSAs as applied to soils as organic fertilizers."

In the present study, kale was extracted with hexane, acetone, and MeOH : water and the dried extracts, as well as the fiber-rich residue, were tested for their bile acid binding capacity. The fiber-rich residue bound total bile acids in amounts equivalent to that bound by raw kale. The lyophilized acetone extract bound significantly more glycochenodeoxycholate and glycodeoxycholate and less of other bile acids. To test whether bile acid binding enhanced the bioaccessibility of polyphenolic compounds from kale, we used ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify chemical constituents and measure their bioaccessibility in an in vitro digestion reaction. This identified 36 phenolic compounds in kale, including 18 kaempferol derivatives, 13 quercetin derivatives, 4 sinapoyl derivatives, and one caffeoylquinic acid. The bioaccessibility of these phenolics was significantly higher (69.4%) in digestions with bile acids. Moreover, bile acids enhanced the bioaccessibility of quercetin by 25 times: only 2.7% of quercetin derivatives were bioaccessible in the digestion without bile acids, but with bile acids, their accessibility increased to 69.5%. Bile acids increased the bioaccessibility of kaempferol from 37.7% to 69.2%. The extractability and biostability of total phenolics in the digested residue increased 1.8 fold in the digestions with bile acids.

The database includes the geographical coordinates of 5 domestic processors, 28 produce distribution centres and 2946 retail outlets from five of the top ten retail chains in Canada. It also includes other critical information to predict the fate of pathogens during distribution of contaminated product through the supply chain including: (a) product volumes handled by each stakeholder, (b) flow of product between stakeholders, (c) temperatures of product each season, and (d) times products spend in each step or during transit between steps, for each season. The database is used by both the simulation and mapping components of the integrated simulation tool during risk assessment exercises associated with emergency preparedness planning and training.

Surface soil, atmospherically deposited surface films on windows, and leaves of Amaranthus dubius were sampled at known distances from the roads and analyzed for lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd) using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Atmospherically deposited trace metal particulates were sampled using window glass as an inert, passive collector. Total trace metal concentrations in soils ranged from 30.0+/-2.3 to 64.6+/-11.7 mg/kg Pb, 78.4+/-18.4 to 265.6+/-63.2 mg/kg Zn, and 0.8+/-0.13 to 1.40+/-0.16 mg/kg Cd. Total trace metal levels in soil decreased rapidly with distance from the road. Total Pb decreased with distance up to 30 m from the road, where it reached a background soil concentration of 28 mg/kg dry weight. The study found background values of 50 and 1.4 mg/kg for Zn and Cd in roadside soils, respectively. Similarly, Pb concentration in Amaranthus dubius leaves decreased with increasing distance from the road edge. The dominant pathway for Pb contamination was from atmospheric deposition, which was consistent with Pb concentrations in surface films. The mean Pb concentrations in leaves of roadside crops were higher than those in their respective roots, with the highest leaf-to-root ratio observed in the Brassica oleraceae acephala group. The lowest Pb and Zn concentrations were found in the fruit compared to the leaves of the same crops. Leaves of roadside vegetables were therefore considered a potential source of heavy metal contamination to farmers and consumers in urban areas. It is recommended that leafy vegetables should be grown 30 m from roads in high-traffic, urban areas."

Lettuce and leek crops were selected as a worse-case scenario since leafy green vegetable has a high potential for organic contaminants uptake. The results revealed limited accumulation of contaminants in soil and plant leaves, their concentration levels being in the range of 1-30 ng/g and 1-660 ng/g range in soil and leaves, respectively. This was likely related to abiotic and biotic transformation or simply binding processes in soil, which limited contaminants plant uptake. This assumption was underpinned by studies of the enantiomeric fractionation of chiral compounds (e. g. climbazole and metoprolol) in soil as pieces of evidence of biodegradation and by the identification of transformation products or metabolites in leaves by means of liquid chromatography - high resolution - mass spectrometry using a suspect screening workflow. The high bioconcentration factors were not limited to compounds with intermediate Dow (100 to 1000) such as carbamazepine but also observed for hydrophilic compounds such as clarithromycin, hydrochlorothiazide and the food additives acesulfame and sucralose. This result assumed that accumulation was not only driven by passive processes (e. g. lipoidal diffusion through lipid bilayer cell membranes or Casparian strip) but might be supported by carrier-mediated transporters. As a whole, this study confirmed earlier reports on the a de minimis human health risk related to the consumption of raw leafy green vegetable irrigated with domestic TWW containing organic contaminants residues."

While Bisphenol A sorbs strongly to the sewage-amended soil, 4% by mass was predicted to enter soil pore water resulting in significant uptake by crops particularly leafy vegetables (3.12-75.5 ng g(-1)), but also for root crops (1.28-31.0 ng g(-1)) with much lower uptake into cereal grains (0.62-15.0 ng g(-1)).

Moreover, Malabar spinach was identified as a leafy vegetable that exhibits low accumulation of heavy metal(loid)s. The accumulation capacity of different Malabar spinach varieties was verified, and a Cd soil safety threshold was determined using a pot experiment. Overall, Pb and Cd were the main soil and vegetable contaminants found in both study sites. The HI values for all leafy vegetables, apart from Malabar spinach, were greater than 1, indicating the presence of risks to human health; moreover, the health risks were greater for children than adults. The Malabar spinach pot experiment results showed that only some Cd forms exceeded China's maximum permissible standards. Furthermore, Malabar spinach varieties A (instant Malabar spinach), C (extra-large leaf green vine Malabar spinach), and F (large leaf Malabar spinach) displayed the lowest Cd accumulation. We calculated Cd total and bioavailable soil safety thresholds of 4.75 and 0.77 mg kg-1, respectively.

Accordingly, it is necessary to understand the behaviors of Sb and As in the vegetable-soil system. Moreover, although Sb and As are often assumed to have similar biogeochemical behavior, identified differences in the controlling factors affecting mobility and bioavailability of Sb and As in soils need further investigation. In this study, 112 pairs of soil and flowering cabbage samples were collected from typical farmland protection areas and vegetable-producing regions across the Pearl River Delta (PRD), South China. The contamination levels of Sb and As in soils and harvested cabbages across the PRD were investigated. The main factors affecting the mobility and bioavailability of Sb and As in the cabbage-soil system were disentangled using a random forest model. The contamination levels of Sb in the cabbages and soils of the PRD were generally low, but the soils were moderately polluted by As. Increased concentrations of Fe oxides could decrease Sb accumulation in cabbages but increased the mobilization of As in soils to some extent. In contrast, Al oxides contributed strongly to the mobilization of Sb and the immobilization of As. Moreover, an increased sand content promoted the mobility of Sb and As, whereas increased silt and clay contents showed inhibitory effects. The interactions of As and Sb with Fe oxides decreased the mobility of Sb but moderately increased the mobility of As in soils. Overall, the behaviors of Sb and As in the cabbage-soil system under the effect of several important environmental factors showed some differences indicating that these differences should be considered in the remediation of co-contaminated soils."

In order to identify and rank specific food/pathogen combinations most often linked to human cases originating from FoNAO in the EU, a semi-quantitative model was developed using seven criteria: strength of associations between food and pathogen based on the foodborne outbreak data from EU Zoonoses Monitoring (2007-2011), incidence of illness, burden of disease, dose-response relationship, consumption, prevalence of contamination and pathogen growth potential during shelf life. The top ranking food/pathogen combination was Salmonella spp. and leafy greens eaten raw followed by (in equal rank) Salmonella spp. and bulb and stem vegetables, Salmonella spp. and tomatoes, Salmonella spp. and melons, and pathogenic Escherichia coli and fresh pods, legumes or grains. Despite the inherent assumptions and limitations, this risk model is considered a tool for risk managers, as it allows ranking of food/pathogen combinations most often linked to foodborne human cases originating from FoNAO in the EU. Efforts to collect additional data even in the absence of reported outbreaks as well as to enhance the quality of the EU-specific data, which was used as input for all the model criteria, will allow the improvement of the model outputs. Furthermore, it is recommended that harmonised terminology be applied to the categorisation of foods collected for different reasons, e. g. monitoring, surveillance, outbreak investigation and consumption.

As a metric of measurement of HHRA, a comparison of THQ values could yield previously unreported insights into HHRA differences among the compared populations. A comparison of THQ values among the consumer groups indicated higher HHR for Chinese Malaysians and children due to their higher vegetable consumption and lower body weight, respectively.

To compare these potential postharvest handling conditions, leaves were exposed to different levels of illumination (0, 1,000, and 2,000 lx), temperature differential (5, 11, 14, 20, and 26°C), and RH (99, 85, and 74%) for a short time before or during washing. Washing of baby spinach was carried out in water containing green fluorescent protein-tagged Salmonella Typhimurium (6.5 log CFU/ml) at 5°C for 2 min, followed by surface disinfection with chlorine (10,000 μg/ml) for 1 min, two rinses in water for 10 s, and spin drying for 15 s. Internalization was assessed by enumerating the pathogen on Salmonella-Shigella agar and by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Illumination of spinach leaves before and during washing and a negative temperature differential during washing did not significantly (P > 0.05) increase the number of internalized bacteria. However, exposure of leaves to low-RH conditions before washing, which reduced the tissue water content, decreased internalization of Salmonella compared with internalization in baby spinach exposed to high RH (P ≤ 0.05). Green fluorescent protein-tagged Salmonella Typhimurium was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy at a depth of up to 30 m m beneath the surface of spinach leaves after exposure to a high inoculum level (8 log CFU/ml) for an extended time (2 h). Results show that internalization of Salmonella into baby spinach leaves can occur but can be minimized under specific postharvest handling conditions such as low RH."

Consequently, CECs are routinely detected in TWW-irrigated agricultural soils and runoff from such sites, in biosolids- and manure-amended soils, and in surface and groundwater systems and sediments receiving TWW. Crop plants grown in such contaminated agricultural environments have been found to uptake and accumulate CECs in their tissues, constituting possible vectors of introducing CECs into the food chain; an issue that is presently considered of high priority, thus needing intensive investigation. This review paper aims at highlighting the responsible mechanisms for the uptake of CECs by plants and the ability of each crop plant species to uptake and accumulate CECs in its edible tissues, thus providing tools for mitigating the introduction of these contaminants into the food chain. Both biotic (e. g. plants' genotype and physiological state, soil fauna) and abiotic factors (e. g. soil pore water chemistry, physico-chemical properties of CECs, environmental perturbations) have been proven to influence the ability of crop plants to uptake and accumulate CECs. According to authors' estimates, based on the thorough elaboration of knowledge produced by existing relevant studies, the ability of crop plants to uptake and accumulate CECs decrease in the order of leafy vegetables > root vegetables > cereals and fodder crops > fruit vegetables; though, the uptake of CECs by important crop plants, such as fruit trees, is not yet evaluated. Overall, further studies must be performed to estimate the potential of crop plants to uptake and accumulate CECs in their edible tissues, and to characterize the risk for human health represented by their presence in human and livestock food products."

In this study, we investigated whether lettuce or its production environment (irrigation water, soil) is able to act as a vector or reservoir of antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli. Over a 1-year period, eight lettuce farms were visited multiple times and 738 samples, including lettuce seedlings (leaves and soil), soil, irrigation water, and lettuce leaves were collected. From these samples, 473 isolates of Escherichia coli were obtained and tested for resistance to 14 antimicrobials. Fifty-four isolates (11.4%) were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. The highest resistance rate was observed for ampicillin (7%), followed by cephalothin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, tetracycline, trimethoprim, and streptomycin, with resistance rates between 4.4 and 3.6%. No resistance to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, or kanamycin was observed. One isolate was resistant to cefotaxime.

Samples were collected before harvest, after washing, and at the end of shelf life. The observed counts were combined with data on the ratio of E. coli to E. coli O157 taken from earlier studies to estimate the probability of illness. The risks of STEC infection associated with species, either spinach ( Spinacia oleracea) or rocket ( Diplotaxis tenuifolia), growing season (spring or autumn), and washing (washed or not washed) were then evaluated. The results indicated that leafy vegetable species and growing season could be possible hurdles for reducing the food safety risk of STEC infection. At harvest, the probability of infection was 87% lower when consuming rocket compared with spinach and 90% lower when consuming leafy vegetables grown in spring compared with autumn. These relative risk reductions remained consistent even with other serving sizes and dose-response models. The lowest risk of STEC infection was associated with leafy vegetables early in the production chain, i. e. , before harvest, while the risk increased during storage and processing. Consequently, the highest risk was observed when leafy vegetables were consumed at the end of shelf life. Washing had no effect on the food safety risk of STEC infection in this study. To improve the quality of QMRA, there is a need for additional data on the relationship between indicator organisms that can be easily enumerated (e. g. , E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae) and E. coli strains that can cause STEC infection (e. g. , E. coli O157) but are difficult to identify in food samples such as leafy vegetables."

The Chinese Beihu area of Wuhan City was selected as a typical case and the measurements of Zn, Cr, Cu, Pb, As, and Cd in soil revealed that TEs pollution was slight and concentrations met the Chinese standards. Meanwhile, some vegetables exceeded corresponding standard limits. To further quantify negative health effects posed by the studied TEs both in soils and vegetables, an established fuzzy health risk assessment for farmers was employed and the results indicated that the soil exposure of As and the vegetable consumption needed the priority control. The carcinogenic risk (CR) of As in soil was [4.60E-6, 1.45E-5] and the cumulative CR (sum of CRAs, CRPb and CRCd) in leafy vegetables was [1.08E-4, 1.38E-4], which was higher than that of the other vegetables. Preventing soil oral exposure and reducing self-grown vegetable consumption (30%-50%) were proven as effective risk interventions via uncertainty control methods. Spatially, the risk grades under maximum membership principle decreased from south to north in the Beihu area, and the south area was identified as the priority control area. Source apportionment identified four source patterns (Zn-Cr-Cu, Pb, As, and Cd) for soil, and the probable bioaccumulation mechanisms for leafy vegetables by multivariate statistical analyses.

Accumulation levels were similar but the extent of PAH uptake in vegetables was species dependent as V. amygdalina accumulated more (0.81 mg/kg). The bioaccumulation factors (BaFs) calculated ranged from 0.22 to 0.63 for L. africanum, and 0.18 to 0.55 for V. amygdalina in site 1 where high PAH levels were recorded in soil. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis revealed a strong positive relation between the PAH content of soil and the amount accumulated by L. africanum (r = 0.5) and V. amygdalina (r = 0.8) at p = 0.05. The vegetable's potential to bioaccumulate PAHs is indicative of their use as good bioindicators for PAH contamination in soil. Only two of the USEPA possible human carcinogenic PAHs were detected, and carcinogenic risk assessment based on occupational exposures to soil particles by adults revealed that the total risk level (7.17 × 10-5) contribution from incidental soil ingestion, dermal contact, and soil particle dust inhalation slightly exceed the USEPA acceptable limits (< 1.00 × 10-5). There is a need for public education on consumption of vegetables grown in and around automobile repair complexes across Nigeria."

This paper focuses on the uptake, accumulation, transfer, and mercury (Hg) sensitivity of leafy vegetables. Two types of soil (an alkaline Cambosol and an acid Ferrosol) and eleven species of leafy vegetable, namely, Spinach, Tung choy, Leek, Fennel, Coriander, Chinese flowering cabbage, Wuta-tsai, Pakchoi, Chicory, Crown daisy, and Lettuce, were selected to investigate their sensitivity to Hg accumulation in a greenhouse pot experiment. Three Hg concentration treatments were carried out as control (background values), low concentration (1.5 times standard value), and high concentration (2 times standard value) as adjusted by the soil pH. Hg concentrations of more than half vegetable samples grown in Cambosol (collected from Shandong Province) reached or exceeded the maximum permissible food safety levels (10 μg kg-1) according to the General Standard of Contaminants in Food in China (GB 2762-2012), while only about 15% in Ferrosol (collected from Jiangxi Province). Meanwhile, Hg bio-concentration factors (BCF) in all treatments were < 1, while Hg translocation factors (TF) in most treatments were < 1. Correlation analysis among soil, root, and edible plant parts revealed that the principal source of Hg in leafy vegetables was most likely from Hg-contaminated soils. Species sensitivity distribution (SSD) models were constructed and their simulated curves indicated that sensitivity to Hg was highest in Pakchoi in low Hg-contaminated soils, and Chicory in highly Hg-contaminated soils. Therefore, Hg concentration is mostly accumulated in roots of leafy crops, which reduces the risk of Hg bioaccumulation in edible portion of vegetables, and (2) Brassicaceae vegetables are mostly less sensitive to soil Hg contamination. Our results provide effective guidance for the selection of leafy vegetables for cultivation and daily consumption that minimizes health risk."

This study was conducted to characterize the routes of microbial contamination in produce and to identify areas of potential contamination from production through postharvest handling. We report here the levels of bacterial indicator organisms and the prevalence of selected pathogens in produce samples collected from the southern United States. A total of 398 produce samples (leafy greens, herbs, and cantaloupe) were collected through production and the packing shed and assayed by enumerative tests for total aerobic bacteria, total coliforms, total Enterococcus, and Escherichia coli. These samples also were analyzed for Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, and E. coli O157:H7. Microbiological methods were based on methods recommended by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. For all leafy greens and herbs, geometric mean indicator levels ranged from 4.5 to 6.2 log CFU/g (aerobic plate count); less than 1 to 4.3 log CFU/g (coliforms and Enterococcus); and less than 1 to 1.5 log CFU/g (E. coli). In many cases, indicator levels remained relatively constant throughout the packing shed, particularly for mustard greens. However, for cilantro and parsley, total coliform levels increased during the packing process. For cantaloupe, microbial levels significantly increased from field through packing, with ranges of 6.4 to 7.0 log CFU/g (aerobic plate count); 2.1 to 4.3 log CFU/g (coliforms); 3.5 to 5.2 log CFU/g (Enterococcus); and less than 1 to 2.5 log CFU/g (E. coli). The prevalence of pathogens for all samples was 0, 0, and 0.7% (3 of 398) for L. monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7, and Salmonella, respectively.

The present study aimed to assess the source of contamination and pollution levels in urban garden soils, as well as the health risks for adults and children consuming vegetables grown in such environments. Various types of vegetable samples and their corresponding soils from 26 community gardens were collected throughout Chengdu City in southwestern China. The results showed that leafy vegetables, particularly lettuce leaves and Chinese cabbage, had relatively higher levels of Cd (0.04 mg/kg FW) and Pb (0.05 mg/kg FW), while higher levels of As (0.07 mg/kg FW), Cr (0.07 mg/kg FW), and Hg (0.003 mg/kg FW) were found in amaranths, tomatoes, and Houttuynia cordatas, respectively. The pollution indices revealed that the vegetable purplish soils were relatively more polluted by Cd and As, and the concentrations of these metals in vegetables were correlated with their concentrations in the soils. Principal component analysis grouped the PTEs in two dimensions that cumulatively explained 62.3% of their variation, and hierarchical clustering identified two distinct clusters indicating that Cr originated from a unique source. The health risk assessment revealed that exposure to As and Cd induced the greatest non-carcinogenic risk, whereas Cr was most likely to cause cancer risks. Furthermore, contaminated vegetable consumption was riskier for children than adults. The critical factors contributing to PTE contamination in vegetable gardens were determined to be vegetable species, total soil element content, soil pH, and soil organic matter content. Overall, Cr and As pollution present the greatest concern, and community health care services must enact more effective regulatory and preventative measures for urban gardens in terms of PTEs."

Traditional Cd quantification methods are time-consuming, expensive, and generate a lot of toxic waste, slowing development of methods to reduce uptake. The objective of this study was to determine whether hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and machine learning (ML) can be used to predict Cd concentrations in plants using kale (Brassica oleracea) and basil (Ocimum basilicum) as model crops. The experiments were conducted in an automated phenotyping facility where all environmental conditions except soil Cd concentration were kept constant. Cd concentrations were determined at harvest using traditional methods and used to train the ML models with data collected from the imaging sensor. Visible/near infrared (VNIR) images were also collected at harvest and processed to calculate reflectance at 473 bands between 400 to 998 nm. All reflectance spectra were subject to the feature selection algorithm ReliefF and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to generate data and provide input to evaluate three ML classification models: artificial neural network (ANN), ensemble learning (EL), and support vector machine (SVM). Plants were categorized according to Cd concentrations higher or lower than the safety threshold of 0.2 mg kg-1 Cd. Wavelengths with the highest ranks for Cd detection were between 519 and 574, and 692 and 732 nm, indicating that Cd content likely altered the plants' chlorophyll content and altered leaf internal structure. All models were able to sort the plants into groups, though the model with the best F1 score was the ANN for the validation subset that utilized reflectance from all wavelengths. This study demonstrates that HSI and ML are promising technologies for the fast and precise diagnosis of Cd in leafy green plants, though additional studies are needed to adapt this approach for more complex field environments."

The following three sites were chosen to biomonitor Hg pollution: a paddy field receiving sewage irrigation (industrial and urban sewage effluents) for the last 30 years, a vegetable field receiving sewage irrigation for 15 years, and a grass field which did not receive sewage irrigation in history. Results showed that the total Hg levels in the paddy (0.65 mg kg-1) and vegetation fields (0.42 mg kg-1) were significantly higher than the local background level (0.073 mg kg-1) and the China national soil environment quality standard for Hg in grade I (0.30 mg kg-1). The TGM levels in ambient air were significantly higher in the paddy (71.3 ng m-3) and vegetable fields (39.2 ng m-3) relative to the control (9.4 ng m-3) and previously reported levels (1.45 ng m-3), indicating severe Hg pollution in the atmospheric environment of the sewage-irrigated areas. Furthermore, gaseous mercury was the dominant form of Hg uptake in the leaves or irreversibly bound to leaves. The comparison of Hg uptake levels among the five vegetables showed that the gradient of Hg accumulation followed the order spinach > red amaranth > Chinese chives > rape > lettuce.

Over a 16-month period, a series of time-temperature profiles for bagged salads were obtained from five transportation routes covering four geographic regions (432 profiles), as well as during retail storage (4,867 profiles) and display (3,799 profiles). Five different time-temperature profiles collected during 2 to 3 days of transport, 1 and 3 days of retail storage, and 3 days of retail display were then duplicated in a programmable incubator to assess E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes growth in commercial bags of romaine lettuce mix. Microbial growth predictions using the Koseki-Isobe and McKellar-Delaquis models were validated by comparing the root mean square error (RMSE), bias, and the acceptable prediction zone between the laboratory growth data and model predictions. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to calculate the probability distribution of microbial growth from 8,122,127,472 scenarios during transport, cold room storage, and retail display. Using inoculated bags of retail salad, E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes populations increased a maximum of 3.1 and 3.0 log CFU/g at retail storage. Both models yielded acceptable RMSEs and biases within the acceptable prediction zone for E. coli O157:H7. Based on the simulation, both pathogens generally increased <2 log CFU/g during transport, storage, and display. However, retail storage duration can significantly impact pathogen growth. This large-scale U. S. study-the first using commercial time/temperature profiles to assess the microbial risk of leafy greens-should be useful in filling some of the data gaps in current risk assessments for leafy greens."

Recently, the number of reported pathogenic foodborne outbreaks related to leafy greens has increased. Therefore, it is important to try to alleviate the human health burden associated with these outbreaks. Processing of fresh-cut lettuce, including washing, is a step in the supply chain that needs to be well controlled to avoid cross-contamination. Current measures to control the quality of lettuce during washing include the use of chemicals like chlorine; however, questions regarding the safety of chlorine have prompted research for alternative solutions with peracetic acid (PAA). This study evaluates the effectiveness of a PAA (c. a. 75 mg/L) solution on the reduction of a commensal E. coli strain during the washing of fresh-cut lettuce. Experiments were performed at the laboratory scale and validated at the industrial scale. We observed that the use of PAA was not adversely affected by the organic load in the water. The contact time and dose of the PAA showed to be relevant factors, as observed by the approximately 5-log reduction of E. coli in the water. Results showed that once introduced during washing, E. coli remained attached to the lettuce, thus supporting the need to control for pathogenic bacteria earlier in the supply chain (e. g. , during primary production) as well as during washing. Moreover, our results showed that the use of PAA during washing did not have an apparent effect on the levels of fluorescent pseudomonads (FP) and total heterotrophic bacteria (THB) in lettuce. Overall, our results at the laboratory and industrial scales confirmed that during the processing of fresh-cut produce, where the accumulation of soil, debris, and other plant exudates can negatively affect washing, the use of a PAA (c. a. 75 mg/L) solution was an effective and safe wash water disinfectant that can potentially be used at the industrial scale."

The Fukushima nuclear power plants were inundated and stricken, followed by radionuclide releases outside the crippled reactors. Provisional regulation values for radioactivity in food and drink were set on 17 March and were adopted from the preset index values, except that for radioiodines in water and milk ingested by infants. For radiocesiums, uranium, plutonium and transuranic α emitters, index values were defined in all food and drink not to exceed a committed effective dose of 5 mSv/year. Index values for radioiodines were defined not to exceed a committed equivalent dose to the thyroid of 50 mSv/year, and set in water, milk and some vegetables, but not in other foodstuffs. Index values were calculated as radioactive concentrations of indicator radionuclides ((131)I for radioiodines, (134)Cs and (137)Cs for radiocesiums) by postulating the relative radioactive concentration of coexisting radionuclides (e. g. , (132)I, (133)I, (134)I, (135)I and (132)Te for (131)I). Surveys were thence conducted to monitor levels of (131)I, (134)Cs and (137)Cs. Provisional regulation values were exceeded in tap water, raw milk and some vegetables, and restrictions on distribution and consumption began on 21 March. Fish contaminated with radioiodines at levels of concern were then detected, so that the provisional regulation value for radioiodines in seafood adopted from that in vegetables were additionally set on 5 April. Overall, restrictions started within 25 days after the first excess in each food or drink item, and maximum levels were detected in leafy vegetables (54,100 Bq/kg for (131)I, and a total of 82,000 Bq/kg for (134)Cs and (137)Cs). This paper focuses on the logic behind such food safety regulations, and discusses its underlying issues.

The objectives of this study were to elucidate distribution and migration of Cd, Cu, Zn, As and Pb and associated health implications to local inhabitants. We collected and analyzed 74 crop samples including 28 sugarcane, 30 vegetables, 16 paddy rice and the corresponding soil samples, used correlation and linear relationship for transformation process analysis, and applied carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk for hazard evaluation. Results showed that the local soils were heavily polluted with Cd, Cu and As (especially for Cd) and the mean Igeo value was as high as 3.77. Cadmium, Cu, and Zn in rice and vegetables were comparable with those found four years ago, while As and Pb in edible parts were 2 to 5 times lower than before. The root uptake of Cd and Zn contributed mainly to their high concentrations in crops due to high exchangeable fraction of soil, while leafy vegetables accumulated elevated As and Pb contents mainly due to the atmospheric deposition. Metal concentrations in sugarcane roots were higher than those in rice and vegetable roots. The risk assessment for crops consumption showed that the hazard quotients values were of 21 to 25 times higher than the threshold level for vegetables and rice, indicating a potential non-carcinogenic risk to the consumers. The estimated mean total cancer risk value of 0.0516 more than 100 times exceeded the USEPA accepted risk level of 1×10(-4), indicating unsuitability of the soil for cultivating the food crops.

The potential risk to the environment and human health has aroused much public concern. Therefore, it is important to investigate the degradation behavior, residue distribution and dietary risk assessment of thiamethoxam in Chinese kale. A sensitive analytical method for determination of thiamethoxam and its metabolite clothianidin residue in Chinese kale was established and validated through a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) technique with ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The recoveries were 85.4-101.2% for thiamethoxam and 79.5-108.1% for clothianidin, with the relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 0.9-10.2% and 1.8-6.0%, respectively. For the dissipation kinetics, the data showed that thiamethoxam in Chinese kale was degraded with the half-lives of 4.1 to 4.5 days. In the terminal residue experiments, the residues of thiamethoxam were 0.017-0.357 mg kg-1 after application 2-3 times with a preharvest interval (PHI) of 7 days under the designed dosages. The chronic and acute dietary exposure assessment risk quotient (RQ) values of thiamethoxam in Chinese kale for different Chinese consumers were 0.08-0.19% and 0.05-0.12%, respectively, and those of clothianidin were 0.01-0.04% and 0.02-0.04%, respectively, all of the RQ values were lower than 100%. Thiamethoxam in Chinese kale was rapidly degraded following first-order kinetics models. The dietary risk of thiamethoxam and clothianidin through Chinese kale was negligible to consumers. The results from this study are important reference for Chinese governments to developing criteria for the safe and rational use of thiamethoxam, setting maximum residue levels (MRLs), monitoring the quality safety of agricultural products and protecting consumer health."

Nearly 100 bags of baby spinach and hearts of romaine lettuce from a single brand were subjected to both top and bottom sampling. Product was blended, and a portion serially diluted and plated to obtain TBC. Total coliform and E. coli levels were estimated by the most-probable-number (MPN) technique with ColiComplete discs. Top-sampled TBC from bags of baby spinach (48 bags, 13 different lots) ranged from 3.9 to 8.1 log CFU/g and bottom-sampled TBC ranged from 4.0 to 8.2 log CFU/g, with 52% of the bags (or 39% of the lots) producing TBC higher in bottom samples. For hearts of romaine (47 bags from 19 different lots), top-sampled bags had TBC ranging from 2.4 to 7.0 log, and bottom-sampled bags had TBC from 3.3 to 7.3 log, with 64% of the bags (or 63% of the lots) showing higher TBC in bottom samples. However, we are unable to reject the hypothesis that the top and bottom samples from either commodity contain the same TBC (P ≥ 0.08). No E. coli was detected and total coliform bacteria counts were, with few exceptions, ≥210 MPN/g, irrespective of TBC. In general, lots with the most number of days before the printed ""use-by"" date had lower TBC. However, the R(2) values for either baby spinach (0.4085) or hearts of romaine (0.2946) suggest that age might not be a very good predictor of higher TBC. TBC varied widely between lots and even more so within same-lot samples, as indicated by the sum of squares results. This finding, along with higher TBC in bottom samples, suggests further consideration when a microbiological sampling scheme of bagged produce is designed."

In Western cuisine, leafy green vegetables are usually eaten fresh and raw, with no step in the long chain from seed to consumption where potentially harmful microorganisms could be completely eliminated, e. g. , through heating. A concerning trend in recent years is disease outbreaks caused by various leafy vegetable crops and one of the most important foodborne pathogens in this context is Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). Other pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia enterocolitica and Listeria monocytogenes should also be considered in disease risk analysis, as they have been implicated in outbreaks associated with leafy greens. These pathogens may enter the horticultural value network during primary production in field or greenhouse via irrigation, at harvest, during processing and distribution or in the home kitchen/restaurant. The hurdle approach involves combining several mitigating approaches, each of which is insufficient on its own, to control or even eliminate pathogens in food products. Since the food chain system for leafy green vegetables contains no absolute kill step for pathogens, use of hurdles at critical points could enable control of pathogens that pose a human health risk. Hurdles should be combined so as to decrease the risk due to pathogenic microbes and also to improve microbial stability, shelf-life, nutritional properties and sensory quality of leafy vegetables. The hurdle toolbox includes different options, such as physical, physiochemical and microbial hurdles. The goal for leafy green vegetables is multi-target preservation through intelligently applied hurdles. This review describes hurdles that could be used for leafy green vegetables and their biological basis, and identifies prospective hurdles that need attention in future research."

However, it remains unclear as to whether soil-applied Mg affects the vegetable nutritional quality and human health risk of heavy metals from field-grown Chinese cabbage. Here we conducted a two-year, two-crop cycle field experiment in south-western China to evaluate crop yield, vegetable nutrition and heavy metal accumulation in Chinese cabbage supplied with varying levels of Mg (0-90 kg ha-1). Soil application of Mg did not increase the cabbage yield. However, it did increase the vegetable vitamin C and water-soluble protein content by 20.0 % and 57.9 % with 45 and 22.5 kg Mg ha-1 application, respectively, compared to control. The nitrate content of Mg-supplied (45 kg ha-1) cabbages was significantly lower, by about 14 %, than the control. Further, it also significantly decreased the accumulation of cadmium and nickel in the above-ground tissues by reducing their uptake from soil to root or their translocation from root to shoot. Magnesium application, however, increased chromium uptake. A human health risks assessment nonetheless showed that the contribution of chromium from Mg-supplied plants to threshold hazard quotient and threshold carcinogenic risk were indeed much lower than that of cadmium and nickel, proving the value of crop Mg supplementation for ameliorating non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks to humans with the consumption of Chinese cabbage. Here we show that soil application of Mg in the range of 22.5-45 kg ha-1 to Chinese cabbage will significantly improve its nutritional qualities and alleviate the potential human health risks of heavy metals associated with Chinese cabbage consumption."

Of the 3,463 citations identified, 68 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Most of these studies were on leafy greens and tomatoes. Six studies assessed produce contamination with respect to animal host-related risk factors, and 20 studies assessed contamination with respect to pathogen characteristics. Sixty-two studies assessed the association between produce contamination and factors related to produce, water, and soil, as well as local ecological conditions of the production location. While evaluations of many risk factors for preharvest-level produce contamination have been reported, the quality assessment of the reviewed studies confirmed the existence of solid evidence for only some of them, including growing produce on clay-type soil, the application of contaminated or non-pH-stabilized manure, and the use of spray irrigation with contaminated water, with a particular risk of contamination on the lower leaf surface. In conclusion, synthesis of the reviewed studies suggests that reducing microbial contamination of irrigation water and soil are the most effective targets for the prevention and control of produce contamination. Furthermore, this review provides an inventory of the evaluated risk factors, including those requiring more research."

The link between vegetable crops and fecally contaminated irrigation water establishes an environmental scenario that can result in a risk to human health. The aim of this work was to analyze the enteric viral quality in leafy green vegetables from Córdoba (Argentina) and its potential association with viral contamination of irrigation waters. During July-December 2012, vegetables were collected from peri-urban green farms (n = 19) and its corresponding urban river irrigation waters (n = 12). Also, urban sewage samples (n = 6) were collected to analyze the viral variants circulating in the community. Viruses were eluted and concentrated by polyethylene glycol precipitation and then were subject to Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction to assess the genome presence of norovirus, rotavirus and human astrovirus. The concentrates were also inoculated in HEp-2 (Human Epidermoid carcinoma strain #2) cells to monitor the occurrence of infective enterovirus. The frequency of detection of the viral groups in sewage, irrigation water and crops was: norovirus 100%, 67% and 58%, rotavirus 100%, 75% and 5%, astrovirus 83%, 75% and 32% and infective enterovirus 50%, 33% and 79%, respectively. A similar profile in sewage, irrigation water and green vegetables was observed for norovirus genogroups (I and II) distribution as well as for rotavirus and astrovirus G-types. These results provide the first data for Argentina pointing out that green leafy vegetables are contaminated with a broad range of enteric viruses and that the irrigation water would be a source of contamination. The presence of viral genomes and infective particles in food that in general suffer minimal treatment before consumption underlines that green crops can act as potential sources of enteric virus transmission. Public intervention in the use of the river waters as irrigation source is needed."

In the present work, we undertook the first modelling study which produced consistent health-risk maps for the whole eastern China. Regional maps of Probable Daily Intake (PDI) of Total mercury (THg) and Methylmercury (MeHg) over the studied area were produced, which were important for the researchers and policy-makers to evaluate the risk and to propose mitigation measures if necessary. The model predictions of air-borne Hg(0) concentrations agreed well with the observations and simulated Hg distribution over China as reported elsewhere. Our calculated PDIs of THg in vegetables were also comparable to those reported in the literature. There was 19% of the studied area with PDIs > 0.08µgkg-1 bw d-1 [half of the reference dose (RfD)]. The PDI for THg (MeHg) varied from 0.034 (0.007) to 0.162 (0.035)µgkg-1 bw d-1 with an average of 0.058 (0.013)µgkg-1 bw d-1. The highest calculated PDIs of THg over China was equal to the RfD, while the calculated PDIs of MeHg were well below the RfD of 0.1µgkg-1 bw d-1. The health risk was of concern through consumption of THg in leafy vegetables, rice/wheat and fish in Liaoning Provinces, Hunan, Zhejiang and Guizhou Provinces, with the associated PDIs exceeding the RfD. Despite this, the heath risk of MeHg exposure for the general population in southern China from the same foodstuff consumption was not a concern. The contribution of consumption through leafy vegetation should be considered when THg and MeHg exposures to the population are evaluated. The results improve our understanding in managing public health risk in China especially in large cities with high population, and thus have important contribution to enhance sustainable urbanization as one of the principle goals under the framework of the Nature-Based Solution (NBS)."

As farmers' markets have increased in size and complexity in the kinds of foods sold at these venues, so have the potential food safety risks. Since 2008, seven major foodborne illness outbreaks and two recalls associated with food products from farmers' markets have occurred, causing 80 known reported illnesses and one death. Various researchers also have observed vendors performing high-risk food safety retail behaviors, and others have identified microbiological hazards in foods sold at farmers' markets. In this study, the presence of hygiene indicators (coliforms, fecal coliforms, Listeria spp. , and Escherichia coli ) was assessed in select samples of leafy green produce and meat obtained from farmers' markets in Pennsylvania. E. coli isolates were further characterized by phylogenetic profile and virulence potential. E. coli was present in 40% (20 of 50) and 18% (9 of 50) of beef and pork samples, respectively, and in 28% (15 of 54), 29% (15 of 52), and 17% (8 of 46) of kale, lettuce, and spinach samples, respectively. Listeria spp. was found in 8% (4 of 50) of beef samples, 2% (1 of 54) of kale samples, 4% (2 of 52) of lettuce samples, and 7% (3 of 46) of spinach samples. Among the 10 Listeria spp. isolates, 3 were identified as L. monocytogenes. E. coli isolated from meat samples mainly clustered into phylogroup B1 (66%; 19 of 29), whereas produce isolates clustered into phylogroups B2 (36%; 14 of 39) and B1 (33%; 13 of 39).

We reviewed multistate foodborne disease outbreaks reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System during 1973-2010. We calculated the percentage of multistate foodborne disease outbreaks relative to all foodborne disease outbreaks and described characteristics of multistate outbreaks, including the etiologic agents and implicated foods.

Inactivation of norovirus prior to consumption is essential to protect public health. Because of the inability to propagate human noroviruses in vitro, murine norovirus (MNV-1) and feline calicivirus (FCV-F9) have been used as surrogates to model human norovirus behavior under laboratory conditions. The objectives of this study were to determine thermal inactivation kinetics of MNV-1 and FCV-F9 in spinach, compare first-order and Weibull models, and measure the uncertainty associated with the process. D-values were determined for viruses at 50, 56, 60, 65, and 72 °C in 2-ml vials. The D-values calculated from the first-order model (50 to 72 °C) ranged from 0.16 to 14.57 min for MNV-1 and 0.15 to 17.39 min for FCV-9. Using the Weibull model, the tD for MNV-1 and FCV-F9 to destroy 1 log (D ≈ 1) at the same temperatures ranged from 0.22 to 15.26 and 0.27 to 20.71 min, respectively. The z-values determined for MNV-1 were 11.66 ± 0.42 °C using the Weibull model and 10.98 ± 0.58 °C for the first-order model and for FCV-F9 were 10.85 ± 0.67 °C and 9.89 ± 0.79 °C, respectively. There was no difference in D- or z-value using the two models (P > 0.05). Relative uncertainty for dilution factor, personal counting, and test volume were 0.005, 0.0004, and ca. 0.84%, respectively. The major contribution to total uncertainty was from the model selected. Total uncertainties for FCV-F9 for the Weibull and first-order models were 3.53 to 7.56% and 11.99 to 21.01%, respectively, and for MNV-1, 3.10 to 7.01% and 13.14 to 16.94%, respectively. Novel and precise information on thermal inactivation of human norovirus surrogates in spinach was generated, enabling more reliable thermal process calculations to control noroviruses. The results of this study may be useful to the frozen food industry in designing blanching processes for spinach to inactivate or control noroviruses."

Additionally, enrichment procedures were used to detect low concentrations of E. coli. Obtained E. coli isolates were subjected to multiplex PCRs to determine phylogenetic groupings and the presence of virulence genes (eaeA, hlyA, stx1, and stx2). All E. coli were tested for resistance to 15 antibiotics using a disk diffusion assay. Lettuce samples yielded mean aerobic colony counts of 6.3 log CFU/g. Coliforms were detected in 72% of samples, with a median concentration of 1.9 log CFU/g. Of samples, 13% were found to harbor E. coli, with a median level of 0.7 log CFU/g. Antibiogram typing of all E. coli (n = 33) revealed that 97% possessed resistance to one or more antimicrobials, with resistance to amikacin (58%), trimethoprim (48%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (45%) being the most common. Phylogroup typing showed that 79% of these isolates belonged to group B1, with the remaining assigned to groups A (9%) or D (12%); no virulence genes were detected.

This study assessed the efficacy of a chlorine-based sanitizer against coliphage MS2, as a potential surrogate for foodborne viruses, on fresh-cut romaine lettuce during simulated commercial production using a small-scale processing line. Before processing, romaine lettuce was inoculated to contain approximately 105 and 106 PFU/g of MS2 for experiments with and without sanitizer, respectively. Lettuce samples were collected following each stage of processing, which included mechanical shredding, 2 min of flume washing (with or without 25 ppm of free chlorine), shaker table dewatering, and centrifugal drying. In addition, the spent centrifuge water and flume wash water were collected, with the flume water concentrated using hollow-fiber ultrafiltration. MS2 was recovered from lettuce in Tris-glycine buffer and quantified as PFUs in a double-agar overlay assay. The greatest reduction in MS2 occurred between shredding and flume washing, with levels remaining relatively stable following flume washing with or without 25 ppm of free chlorine. Average total reductions of 0.8 and 1.0 log PFU/g were seen after processing with and without the sanitizer, respectively, with no statistical difference observed between the two treatments (P > 0.05). The average MS2 level in the spent centrifugation water started at 4.0 log PFU/ml for experiments with sanitizer and the average MS2 reduction in the flume wash water was 4 log (PFU) for experiments with sanitizer, demonstrating that removals could be achieved in the water itself. These findings suggest that the currently recommended commercial production practices are unable to effectively decrease viruses once they have attached to leafy greens during commercial processing."

In this study, eight major vegetables and rhizosphere soils were collected in a peri-urban area with intense electronic information manufacturing activities. The source, distribution and bioaccumulation of six typical metal(loid)s in different vegetable species were analyzed, and exposure risk through vegetable ingestion was estimated. Results showed that vegetables and agricultural soils in the study area suffered from serious metal(loid)s pollution, especially for Cd and Pb. The bioaccumulation capacity differed greatly among individual metal(loid)s and vegetable categories. In general, the highest transfer factors (TF) for Cd, Pb, and As were found in leafy vegetables, while leguminous vegetables had the highest TF of Cu and Zn and root vegetables had the highest TF for Cr. Significant correlations were found between concentrations in vegetables and rhizosphere soils for most metal(loid)s, the exceptions being Pb and Zn. The enrichment of Pb, Cd, Cr and As was mainly attributed to electronic information manufacturing activities, while the enrichment of Zn, Cu and Cd was associated with the application of commercial fertilizers and pesticides. The health risk associated with vegetable intake decreased in the order of leafy > fruit > leguminous > root vegetables. Leafy vegetables were identified as the category with the highest risk, with the mean risk value of 1.26. Cd was the major risk element for leafy vegetables. The non-carcinogenic risks estimated for leguminous and root vegetables were under the acceptable level. In conclusion, special attention should be paid to the health risks of toxic metal(loid)s in leafy vegetables in peri-urban areas with intense electronic information manufacturing activities.

            Dictionary: {}</s>","{'Lettuce': ['Escherichia coli O157:H7', 'Salmonella spp.']}</s>","Lettuce (Lactuca sativa), one of the most consumed leafy vegetables in the world, is frequently implicated with foodborne disease (FBD) outbreaks, with Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli O157:H7 being the most common bacteria to cause this illness. Estimates of prevalence and levels of these pathogens on lettuce are scarce in developed or in developing countries, which hinders risk assessment attempts. In here, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis of reported prevalence and levels of Salmonella spp. and E. coli O157:H7 on lettuce using the worldwide available data. Literature was reviewed and examined the results for inclusion of articles in the meta-analysis. Data (prevalence and/or concentration of Salmonella spp. and E. coli O157:H7 on lettuce, sample characteristic, country of origin, and Salmonella identified serovars) were extracted, and meta-analysis was performed using Open Meta-Analyst, Task Order # 2 software. Although only one work reported the presence of E coli O157:H7 on lettuce, several reports indicated the presence of other, distinct enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) strains, with a mean prevalence of 0.041 (95% CI: 0.005-0.078) and concentration varying from <3.0 MPN/g to >1100 MPN/g. Furthermore, the mean prevalence of Salmonella spp. on lettuce was 0.041 (95% CI: 0.030-0.052), with reported concentrations varying between 0.054 ± 0.058 CFU/g to 218.78 MPN/g. In addition, subgroup analysis of the presence of Salmonella spp. in lettuce revealed a mean prevalence of the bacteria of 0.028 (95% CI: 0.014-0.042) in developed nations and 0.064 (0.041-0.087) in developing nations, with reports varying from 0.001 in Japan to 0.5 in Burkina Faso. Despite a relatively low prevalence, consumption of lettuce is inherently risky because it usually is eaten raw, without thermal treatment to inactivate pathogens. This potential risk further supports performance of quantitative risk assessments to quantify the probability of FBD caused by Salmonella spp. and E. coli O157:H7 transmitted to lettuce."

Although the leaves are primarily consumed, the stems are usually used as a feed for farm animals while the roots are disposed by burning when dry or by composting. The objective of this work was to evaluate the level of trace elements in the tissues of these vegetables at harvest time when they become available to the human ecosystem for exposure to the accumulated trace metals, especially the leaves which are cooked and eaten as soup. The results of the mean trace metal levels in the analyses show that the leaves of A. caudatus had the highest bioconcentration in the following order Ba>Mn>Zn>Cu>Pb>Cr>Co>Ni>Cd>U>Sb, stems: Ba>Zn>Mn>Cu>Cr>Pb>Ni>Co>Cd>U>Sb, and roots: Mn>Ba>Zn>Cu>Cr>Pb>Ni>Co>U>Cd>Sb. In C. olithorus, the order was Mn>Ba>Zn>Cu>Pb>Cr>Co>Ni>Cd>Sb>U in the leaves, Mn>Zn>Ba>Pb>Cr>Cu>Co>Ni>U>Cd>Sb in the roots, and Mn>Zn>Ba>Cu>Cr>Pb>Co>Ni>Cd>U>Sb in the stems. The final result of the vegetable samples showed that the trace metal concentration was in the range of Cr (0.8-58.7), Mn (35.0-9,495.9), Co (0.3-33.6), Cu (2.3-60.3), Zn (16.0-538.2), Cd (0.000-40.53), Sb (0.000-0.037), Ba (13.0-1,175.6), Pb (0.9-39.7), and U (0.0-2.2). The bioconcentration factors (BF) for the transfer of trace metals from soil to the tissues showed a higher ease of bioaccumulation when compared to previous studies. The element with the highest BF in the study was Ba (6.45) in the leaves while the least was Co (0.09) in the roots of A. caudatus. The level of bioconcentration of trace metals in the leaves in most of the samples exceeds the recommended levels given by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA), Nigeria and therefore constitutes a potential public health risk to the populace who consume these vegetables cultivated in effluent-impacted floodplains."

Several steps in the production process have been mechanized to meet the downstream demand for prebagged lettuces. The growth in this market, however, has come with drawbacks, and chief among them are consumers finding wild animals in prepackaged crops. These incidents may signal an overburdened produce supply chain, but we currently lack the information needed to determine if this is a food-safety problem or food-quality concern. Here, we address this gap by reviewing online media coverage of wild vertebrates found in prepackaged produce items by customers in the United States. We discovered 40 independent incidents since 2003 with 95% having occurred during 2008-2018, suggesting that the frequency of incidents may have increased during the last decade. The minority of incidents included wild animals found in organic produce (27.5%), whereas the majority involved conventionally grown crops (72.5%). Most incidents involved amphibians (52.5%) and reptiles (22.5%), while fewer contained mammals (17.5%) and birds (7.5%). Frogs and toads made up all of the amphibian-related incidents, with more than 60% comprising small-bodied treefrogs found in various types of fresh leafy greens. At least seven incidents involved Pacific Treefrogs (Hyliola regilla) and three comprised Green Anoles (Anolis carolinensis). One lizard and nine frogs were found alive, and at least two frogs were released into non-native areas. This is the first review quantifying incidents of vertebrates found by customers in prepackaged produce, yet it remains unclear whether these occurrences indicate a food-safety crisis or a complaint against food quality. Nevertheless, wild animals can spread diseases to humans via contaminated produce, therefore we contend that industry professionals can reduce the potential health risk to their consumers and negative economic consequences to themselves through increased attention to this matter."

A survey study for the use of pesticides and fertilizers was carried out with 740 market gardeners. The levels of POPs (including organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)) were analyzed in irrigation water and 144 vegetable samples collected from different gardening sites. The assessment of potential human health risk was estimated by calculating daily intake and toxic equivalency to quantify the carcinogenicity. The results show highest PAH levels in A. viridis from all studied sites. The concentrations of the sum of seven PCBs (Σ7PCBS) congeners in analyzed plants ranged between 15.89 and 401.36 ng g-1. The distributions of OCPs in both water and A. viridis were congener specific, chlorpyrifos-ethyl and p,p'-DDE were predominantly detected. Among PBDEs, only BDE47 was quantified with noticeable concentration in A. viridis, while no PBDEs were detected in irrigation water. Higher estimated daily intake values indicate that consuming leafy vegetables might associate with increased human health risks. However, calculated incremental lifetime cancer risk values indicates no potential carcinogenic risk for the local population.

An important potential source of pathogen contamination along the food-production continuum is irrigation water, which has led to the implementation of increasingly stringent agricultural irrigation water quality requirements. To better understand factors impacting irrigation water quality, we investigated sources of generic Escherichia coli and how they varied temporally among different sampling sites. Precipitation, Campylobacter species distribution, and physicochemical water quality parameters were also investigated to substantiate microbial source tracking findings. Biweekly sampling was conducted at a reservoir outlet and two downstream canals in southern Alberta, Canada, throughout two irrigation seasons, the latter of which was notable for drought conditions. Overall, 50% of canal samples exceeded Alberta's irrigation guideline for E. coli (100 E. coli per 100 ml), whereas all reservoir samples were below guideline limits. Collectively, E. coli source apportionment, Campylobacter species distribution, and physicochemical water quality data suggest runoff from surrounding agricultural land was a contributing factor to E. coli guideline exceedances in Year 1 only. In Year 2, the majority of exceedances occurred later in the season when there was little precipitation and were largely attributed to cosmopolitan E. coli from wild birds and cattle. Similarities in E. coli host-source and Campylobacter species distributions between the reservoir and canals when the guideline was exceeded suggest the reservoir could be a primary source of E. coli during drought. Increased bacterial concentrations in canals were likely due to environmental conditions that promoted bacterial survival and in-situ proliferation. Our findings support previous accounts that many E. coli isolates possess enhanced survival capabilities, which has implications to bacterial water quality assessments and risk mitigation, particularly under drought conditions."

Average elemental contents of the analyzed vegetables were determined (in mg kg-1) as follows: B (3.21-64.79), Ca (852.51-17,183.20), Cd (0.015-0.09), Cu (6.08-63.47), Fe (116.52-768.66), K (2347.04-17,305.42), Mg (136.34-1261.11), Na (54.75-526.42), Ni (0.09-1.3), Pb (1.91-9.54), and Zn (29.49-314.93). Estimated daily intake, recommended daily allowance, hazard quotients, and carcinogenic risk values of the vegetables were calculated with the help of these results. In considering HQ values, Chinese cabbage was determined to be safe for the consumption of both genders whereas parsley to be safe for only males. Based on the carcinogenic risk calculation, most of the vegetables examined in this study were categorized as moderately risky. It was inferred from the given results that airborne pollution has impaired/increased the mineral contents of vegetables for both genders. The findings obtained from this study were compared with international standards and will contribute to the data available on a global scale."

Because leafy vegetables have been implicated in foodborne disease outbreaks worldwide, 180 cabbage and spinach samples were collected from three major retailers and nine street vendors in Johannesburg, South Africa. Escherichia coli and coliforms were enumerated using Petrifilm plates. The prevalence of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and Shigella was determined using real-time PCR analysis. Identities of presumptive E. coli isolates from the fresh produce were confirmed using matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time of flight mass spectroscopy. Isolates were characterized using phenotypic (antibiotic resistance) and genotypic (phylogenetic and virulence gene) analysis. Hygiene indicator bacteria levels on spinach from formal and informal retailers exceeded the maximum level specified by the Department of Health guidelines for fresh fruit and vegetables. E. coli counts for street vendor spinach were higher (P < 0.0789) than those for retailer spinach. E. coli was present in only two cabbage samples, at 0.0035 CFU/g. L. monocytogenes and Salmonella were detected in 7.2 and 5% of the 180 samples, respectively, based on real-time PCR analysis; Shigella was not detected. Of the 29 spinach E. coli isolates, 37.9% were multidrug resistant. Virulence genes eae and stx1 were present in 14 and 3% of the spinach E. coli isolates, respectively; the stx2 gene was not detected. Eighty-six percent of these isolates belonged to phylogroup A, 3% belonged to group C, 7% belonged to group E, and 3% belonged to clade 1. The results from the current exploratory study on the microbiological quality of spinach bought from selected retailers highlight the need for continued surveillance on a larger scale, especially in the informal sector, to characterize the potential health risks to the consumer."

The fresh vegetables could become Listeria-contaminated if they come in touch with contaminated soil, manure, irrigation water. The aim of this work was to investigate the presence of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes in different kind of vegetables grown in field and greenhouse condition as well as surface and endophytic colonization plant roots of different vegetables species by L. monocytogenes in laboratory conditions. The detection of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes in vegetable samples was done using ISO and PCR methods. The investigation of colonization vegetable roots and detection Listeria-cells inside plant root tissue was done using Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method in combination with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The results showed that 25.58% vegetable samples were positive for Listeria spp. and only one sample (carrot) was positive for L. monocytogenes out of 43 samples in total collected from field and greenhouse. The strain L. monocytogenes EGD-E surface and endophytic colonized carrot root in highest degree while strain L. monocytogenes SV4B was the most represented at leafy vegetable plants, such at lettuce (1.68 × 106 cells/mm3 absolutely dry root) and spinach (1.39 × 106 cells/mm3 absolutely dry root) root surface. The cells of L. monocytogenes SV4B were visible as single cells in interior tissue of plant roots (celery and sweet corn roots) as well as in the interior of the plant root cell at sweet corn root. The cells of L. monocytogenes EGD-E bind to the surface of the plant root and they were less commonly found out on root hair. In the inner layers of the root, those bacterial cells were inhabited intercellular spaces mainly as single cells very close to the larval vessels of root. Our results suggest that L. monocytogenes is very good endophytic colonizer of vegetable plant roots."

These products typically do not undergo a definitive control step such as cooking to eliminate pathogens. To reduce the number of STEC infections from salad products, efforts will need to focus on preventing and reducing contamination throughout the food chain. We performed a systematic review of STEC outbreaks involving sprouted seeds, salad, or leafy green products to determine whether there were recurrent features, such as availability of microbiological evidence or identification of the contamination event, which may inform future investigations and prevention and control strategies. Thirty-five STEC outbreaks linked to contaminated leafy greens were identified for inclusion. The outbreaks occurred from 1995 to 2018 and ranged from 8 to more than 8,500 cases. Detection of STEC in the food product was rare (4 of 35 outbreaks). For the remaining outbreaks, the determination of leafy greens as the source of the outbreak mainly relied on analytical epidemiology (20 of 35) or descriptive evidence (11 of 35). The traceback investigation in 21 of 32 outbreaks was not able to identify possible routes leading to where the STEC bacteria came from or how the leaves were contaminated. Investigations in eight outbreaks found poor practice during processing that may have contributed to the outbreak, such as insufficient postharvest disinfection of the product. Six outbreak investigations were able to identify the outbreak strain in animal feces near the growing fields; two of these were also able to find it in irrigation water on the farms, providing a likely route of contamination. These results highlight the limitations of relying on microbiological confirmation as a basis to initiate investigations of upstream production to understand the source of contamination. This review also demonstrates the importance of, and difficulties associated with, food-chain traceback studies to inform control measures and future prevention."

California is the largest leafy greens producer in the United States, and many related foodborne illness incidents were traced to this state. A systematic overview of leafy greens incidents linked to California was conducted by the California Department of Public Health, Food and Drug Branch through analysis of complaints, routine surveillance sampling, disease outbreaks, and investigations covering 1996 to 2016. The goal was to develop a risk assessment tool to modernize emergency response efforts to foodborne illnesses related to leafy greens. A database including environmental, epidemiologic, and laboratory information for each incident was developed, and descriptive analysis was performed to identify trends. In the 21-year period analyzed, 134 incidents were identified, the majority of which were surveillance related. Approximately 2,240 U. S. cases of confirmed illness were reported (298 California cases resulting in 50 hospitalizations). Romaine lettuce and spinach were the most commonly implicated vehicles. The most prevalent hazard type was microbiological, in particular bacterial, specifically associated with pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli. In California, the overview provided the Food and Drug Branch with a platform to (i) enhance its Food Safety Program, Emergency Response Unit, and California Food Emergency Response Team; (ii) assist in more efficient investigation, response, control, and prevention of California-linked foodborne illness incidents; and (iii) identify knowledge gaps and develop effective definitions, procedures, training, guidelines, and policies that will be used to help prevent future outbreaks. Outcomes provide insight into the situation in the largest leafy greens-producing state and may be used to prioritize limited national food safety resources and aid in future leafy greens-related research and foodborne incident investigations."

The main objective of this study is to determine the concentration of total microcystins (MC-LR and MC-RR) in leafy green plants (Lactuca sativa L. var. longifolia and Eruca sativa) that have previously been irrigated with polluted water. Integrated water samples were collected by cleaned plastic bottles at a depth of about 30 cm from one of the sources of water used to irrigate agricultural lands for crop plants. At the same time, samples from plants were also collected because this water from the lake farm is used for the irrigation of surrounding vegetable plants such as Lactuca sativa L. var. longifolia and Eruca sativa. The dominant species of cyanobacteria in water samples are Microcystis aeruginosa (Kützing) and Oscillatoria limnetica Lemmermann, which were detected with an average cell count 2,300,000 and 450,000 cells/mL, respectively. These two dominant species in water produced two MCs variants (MC-LR, -RR) that were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Dissolve and particulate MCs were detected in the irrigation waters by HPLC with concentrations of 45.04-600 μg/L. MCs in the water samples exceeded the WHO safety limit (1 μg/L) of MC in drinking water. In addition, the total concentration of Microcystin in Lactuca sativa L. var. longifolia and Eruca sativa were 1044 and 1089 ng/g tissues, respectively. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of microcystins by a person (60 kg) consuming 300 g of fresh plants exceeded the total daily intake guidelines (0.04 μg kg-1 body weight) for human food consumption. According to the findings of this study, irrigation water and plants used for human consumption should be tested for the presence of MCs regularly through critical and regularly monitored programs to prevent the accumulation and transfer of such toxins through the food web."

Arsenic and antimony (Sb) often co-occur in contaminated soils; however, little is known about the interactions between As and Sb with PO4 3- on their bioavailability, accumulation, and toxicity in plants. The present study investigated individual and combined As and Sb-contaminated soils across 2 soil PO4 3- concentrations using a commonly consumed leafy vegetable, choy sum (Brassica chinensis var. parachinensis). Increased soil PO4 3- had no clear influence on the bioavailability of As or Sb (derived from a sequential extraction procedure). At high PO4 3- concentration, B. chinensis accumulated higher amounts of As in the shoots and roots in both individual and co-contaminated soil, whereas Sb accumulation increased only when Sb was the only contaminant. When As was the only contaminant, the translocation of As from roots to shoots decreased as soil PO4 3- increased. Increased soil PO4 3- had no influence on Sb translocation from root to shoot. Although As was toxic (impaired growth) at low PO4 3- soil concentration, no toxicity was observed in the high-PO4 3- soil. No toxicity was observed for Sb in either low- or high-PO4 3- soils. Increased soil PO4 3- concentration ameliorated or masked As toxicity to plant growth and led to higher As concentration in the plant's edible parts. The addition of high soil PO4 3- concentrations ameliorated or masked As toxicity to plant growth in both individually and As + Sb co-contaminated soil; however, the plant's edible parts accumulated higher As and Sb concentrations.

In addition, other samples including greenhouse vegetables (81), fertilizers (50), and irrigation water (10) were also collected in the studied region. To illustrate the accumulation characteristics of heavy metals in GSGV and greenhouse vegetables, the heavy metal content of different samples was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technology. The results indicated that the heavy metal content in GSGV was much higher than that in FGM and FS except for lead (Pb). Heavy metals including cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) in GSGV presented with various degrees of accumulation. The mean value of Cd content in the soils in the investigation region was 0.45 mg·kg-1, with about 42.8% of all the soil samples exceeding the Cd content criterion of the Environmental Quality Evaluation Standard for Farmland in Greenhouse Vegetable Production (HJ 333-2006). The content of the other heavy metals was in the normal range, and all met the regulations of the standard. In comparison with different vegetable categories, leafy vegetables showed much higher heavy metal concentrations (Cd 0.033 mg·kg-1 fresh weight) than did fruity ones. In total, about 2.5% and 1.2% of vegetable samples exceeded the regulated values of Cd and Pb recommended by the Standard of Food limits, respectively. With the cultivation time prolonged, heavy metal concentration in soils and vegetables all increased synchronously as the pH value decreased. The content of heavy metals in greenhouse vegetables was significantly influenced by soil pH and organic matter. It can be concluded that the health risk of greenhouse vegetables increased with GSGV accumulating more heavy metals due to the substantial application of chemical fertilizer and manure containing high level of heavy metals."

This study was designed to evaluate the influence of air pollution on leafy vegetables in community gardens of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Vegetable seedlings of Brassica oleracea var. acephala (collard greens) and Spinacia oleracea (spinach) obtained in a non-polluted rural area and growing in vessels containing standard uncontaminated soil were exposed for three consecutive periods of 30, 60 and 90 days in 10 community gardens in Sao Paulo and in one control site. The concentrations of 17 chemical elements (traffic-related elements and those essential to plant biology) were quantified by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Tillandsia usneoides L. specimens were used as air plant biomonitors. The concentrations of As, Cd, Cr and Pb found in vegetables were compared to the recommended values for consumption. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to cluster the elemental concentrations, and Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) were employed to evaluate the association of the factor scores from each PCA component with variables such as local weather, traffic burden and vertical barriers adjacent to the gardens. We found significant differences in the elemental concentrations of the vegetables in the different community gardens. These differences were related to the overall traffic burden, vertical obstacles and local weather. The Pb and Cd concentrations in both vegetables exceeded the limit values for consumption after 60 days of exposure. A strong correlation was observed between the concentration of traffic-related elements in vegetables and in Tillandsia usneoides L. An exposure response was observed between traffic burden and traffic-derived particles absorbed in the vegetables. Traffic-derived air pollution directly influences the absorption of chemical elements in leafy vegetables, and the levels of these elements may exceed the recommended values for consumption."

Responses to the treatment solution were variable and depended on the type of leafy green (leafy lettuce, spinach, or cabbage), cultivar, pathogen, and AA concentration (0.3 to 0.7%). No significant differences in E. coli O157 prevalence were found for untreated and treated cabbage heads and spinach plants (P > 0.05). In contrast, treatment significantly affected Salmonella on 'Bravo F1' green cabbage and '7-Green' spinach (P < 0.05), with odds ratios of 2.2 and 3.3 for finding the pathogen on untreated versus treated greens, respectively. Salmonella was also 7.1 times more likely to be found on an untreated lettuce plant than on a lettuce plant sprayed with a 0.7% AA treatment solution (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 12.2; P < 0.0001). In studies addressing the efficacy of chitosan (0.1 or 0.3%), this chemical failed to reduce the prevalence of either pathogen on lettuce (P > 0.05). Similarly, spraying with 0.3% AA did not affect the prevalence of Salmonella on lettuce plants (P > 0.05); however, treatment solutions with 0.4% AA reduced the likelihood of detecting Salmonella in treated versus untreated plants by 6.6 times (95% CI, 2.1 to 20.9; P = 0.0007). After the lettuce was harvested and hand washed, consumers failed to distinguish either visually or organoleptically between untreated lettuce and lettuce sprayed with an acetic acid solution (P > 0.05).

An ATP monitoring device is a potential sanitation tool to monitor the efficacy of an on-farm cleaning and sanitation program that could help growers meet regulatory expectations mandated by the Produce Safety Rule. This ATP monitoring device uses bioluminescence to detect all ATP (found in bacteria and produce matter cells) from a swabbed surface. Because little work has been done to test the efficacy of these tools under postharvest conditions, the present study evaluated ATP measurement for postharvest food contact surface cleanliness evaluation. Concentrations of leafy greens (spinach, romaine, and red cabbage, with or without Listeria innocua) were used as organic matter applied to stainless steel, high-density polyethylene plastic, and bamboo wood coupons to represent postharvest food contact surfaces. The ATP levels on the coupons were then measured by using swabs and an ATP monitoring device. Results showed that the concentration of L. innocua and leafy greens on a food contact surface had a highly significant effect on the ATP monitoring device reading (P < 0.0001). The ATP monitoring device had a lower limit of detection for L. innocua at 4.5 log CFU per coupon. The type of leafy green on a food contact surface did not affect the ATP reading (P = 0.88). Leafy greens with added L. innocua had a higher ATP reading when compared with saline and L. innocua, demonstrating the presence of leafy green matter contributes to ATP reading when combined with L. innocua. The different food contact surfaces had different ATP response readings (P = 0.03), resulting in no detectable levels of bacteria and/or leafy green material from bamboo wood surfaces (P = 0.16). On the basis of our results, the ATP measurement is an appropriate tool to measure produce or bacterial contamination on stainless steel or high-density polyethylene plastic surfaces; however, it is not recommended for wood surfaces."

Following the pathogen inoculations, parsley samples were washed with the hydrosols and sterile tap water as a control for 0, 20, 40 and 60 min, and reductions on pathogen counts were determined. Sterile tap water was ineffective on all conditions tested. After 20 min of application, oregano and thyme hydrosols were able to significantly (P < 0.05) reduce E. coli O157:H7 counts on low inoculum level, while all hydrosols showed significant reductions (P < 0.05) on high inoculum levels at this period. Additional reductions on E. coli O157:H7 counts were observed with the increasing time. S. aureus was more sensitive to hydrosol treatments, and oregano hydrosol was able to completely eliminate S. aureus after 40 min. In conclusion, decontamination of foodborne pathogens from fresh‐cut vegetables can be achieved by hydrosol treatments. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Recent trends in consumer perceptions have led to increased consumption of ready to eat food products and fresh fruits and vegetables. Leafy vegetables such as parsley are one of the most important ingredients of freshly consumed food products including salads. The main concern on leafy vegetables is their high contamination risk with pathogenic microorganisms including Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Staphylococcus aureus and new strategies based on natural preservatives to control these pathogens on leafy vegetables are of particular interest. Plant hydrosols originated from Lamiaceae family which have antimicrobial effects can be important sources of natural preservatives against certain pathogens. Similarly their simple and cheap production method and their safe recognition for human consumption increase their potential usage as natural decontamination agents. In this study the antimicrobial activities of sage, rosemary, oregano and thyme hydrosols against E. coli O157:H7 and S. aureus on parsley samples were evaluated and their efficiencies were determined."

Ionizing radiation is known to penetrate food tissues, but the efficacy of the process against internalized bacteria is unknown. Leaves of Romaine lettuce and baby spinach were cut into pieces, submerged in a cocktail mixture of three isolates of Escherichia coli O157:H7, and subjected to a vacuum perfusion process to force the bacterial cells into the intercellular spaces in the leaves. Scanning electron microscopy was used to evaluate the efficacy of the perfusion process. The inoculated leaves were then treated with a 3-min water wash, a 3-min wash with a sodium hypochlorite sanitizing solution (300 or 600 ppm), or various doses of ionizing radiation (0.25 to 1.5 kGy). Leaves were stomached to recover the internalized pathogen cells, which were enumerated. The vacuum perfusion effectively forced bacteria into the leaf vasculature and apoplast, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. For spinach leaf pieces, neither the water nor the sodium hypochlorite washes resulted in significant reductions of E. coli O157:H7 cells relative to the untreated control. For Romaine lettuce leaf pieces, 300 and 600 ppm sodium hypochlorite each resulted in less than 1-log reduction; water wash was ineffective. Ionizing radiation, in contrast, significantly reduced the pathogen population, with 4-log (Romaine lettuce) or 3-log (spinach) reductions at the highest dose tested. In Romaine leaves, the reduction was dose dependent across the range of doses tested, with a D10-value (the amount of irradiation necessary to reduce the population by 1 log unit) of 0.39 kGy. In spinach leaves, the pathogen had a biphasic response, with a D10-value of 0.27 kGy in the range of 0 to 0.75 kGy but only slight additional reductions from 0.75 to 1.5 kGy. In this study, ionizing radiation but not chemical sanitizers effectively reduced viable E. coli O157:H7 cells internalized in leafy green vegetables, but the response of the pathogen to irradiation was more complex in spinach leaves than in Romaine lettuce leaves."

Four inoculated surrogate:uninoculated product weight ratios (10:100, 5:100, 1:100, and 0.5:100) and three inoculation levels (103, 101, and 10-1 CFU/g) were used for the three commodities.

After washing and removing the inoculated surrogate products, washed product (∼23, 225-g samples per trial) was analyzed for presence or absence of Salmonella Typhimurium or E. coli O157:H7 by using the GeneQuence Assay. For baby spinach, cilantro, and romaine lettuce, no significant differences ( P > 0.05) in the percentage of positive samples were observed at the same inoculation level and inoculated:uninoculated weight ratio. For each pathogen product evaluated (triplicate trials), inoculation level had a significant impact on the percentage of positive samples after processing, with the percentage of positive samples decreasing, as the initial surrogate inoculation level decreased. The weight ratio of contaminated:noncontaminated product plays an important role: positive samples ranged from 0% to 11.6% ± 2.05% and from 68.1% ± 33.6% to 100% among the four ratios at inoculation of 10-1 and 101 CFU/g, respectively.

Current microbiological methods for identification of EHEC in foods often use PCR-based approaches to screen enrichment broth cultures for characteristic gene markers [i. e. , Shiga toxin (stx) and intimin (eae)]. However, false positives arise when complex food matrices, such as beef, contain mixtures of eae-negative STEC and eae-positive E. coli, but no EHEC with both markers in a single cell. To reduce false-positive detection of EHEC in food enrichment samples, a Multiplexed, Single Intact Cell droplet digital PCR (MuSIC ddPCR) assay capable of detecting the co-occurrence of the stx and eae genes in a single bacterial cell was developed. This method requires: (1) dispersal of intact bacteria into droplets; (2) release of genomic DNA (gDNA) by heat lysis; and (3) amplification and detection of genetic targets (stx and eae) using standard TaqMan chemistries with ddPCR. Performance of the method was tested with panels of EHEC and non-target E. coli. By determining the linkage (i. e. , the proportion of droplets in which stx and eae targets were both amplified), samples containing EHEC (typically greater than 20% linkage) could be distinguished from samples containing mixtures of eae-negative STEC and eae-positive E. coli (0-2% linkage). The use of intact cells was necessary as this linkage was not observed with gDNA extracts. EHEC could be accurately identified in enrichment broth cultures containing excess amounts of background E. coli and in enrichment cultures derived from ground beef/pork and leafy-green produce samples. To our knowledge, this is the first report of dual-target detection in single bacterial cells using ddPCR. The application of MuSIC ddPCR to enrichment-culture screening would reduce false-positives, thereby improving the cost, speed, and accuracy of current methods for EHEC detection in foods."

Because of its chronic endemicity in Lebanon and neighboring countries, this disease has constituted an integral part of research studies conducted by medical doctors and researchers in Lebanon, mostly spearheaded by those at the American University of Beirut (AUB) and its medical center (AUBMC) since the early turn of the last century (1920s). Over 130 wide ranging studies were published; some were innovative e. g. the introduction of the once famous Indirect Haemagglutination (IHA) test for serodiagnosis, and the use of dilute cetrimide as a protoscolicidal agent during surgery. Although the incidence of HD is decreasing in our country, it has acquired increasing public health concern and is considered as an emerging or re-emerging disease in many parts of the world. In this review, we shed light on the numerous studies/publications done in Lebanon as a tribute to those researchers who have impacted the literature of HD in many aspects. The latter include epidemiology and ways of transmission, clinical features and radiological tools for diagnosis, serodiagnosis and immunology, and investigation of different therapeutic modalities for different aspects of the disease. Moreover, consolidating these studies in this review would hopefully represent the historic foundation for interested researchers and investigators, especially in this country, to pursue and build on such studies. The advances in technology, and the availability and utilization of new methodologies will hopefully help find more reliable and efficient ways for the diagnosis, and management of this disease."

In this study, the levels of heavy metals (Cr, Cd, Zn, Fe, Pb, As, Mn, Cu, Hg, Ni and Co) in soil and commonly consumed vegetables from Mojo area in central Ethiopia have been determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrophotometer (ICP-OES) and possible health risks due to the consumptions of the vegetables have also been estimated. The levels of As, Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, Hg and Co were exceeded the reference level in agricultural soil. Likewise, As, Pb, Cd, Cr and Hg levels exceeded the recommended values in vegetable samples with concentrations ranging from 1.93-5.73, 3.63-7.56, 0.56-1.56, 1.49-4.63 and 3.43-4.23 mg/kg, respectively. It was observed that leafy vegetable (cabbage) has accumulated heavy metals to greater extent compared with tomato. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of toxic metals due to the consumption of the vegetables were below the maximum tolerable daily intake (MTDI). However, the total health quotient (THQ), calculated based on EDI of the heavy metals were found > 1 for As and Hg due to tomato consumption and for As, Hg and Co due to cabbage consumption, suggesting significant health risk. The health index (HI) due to the intake of toxic metals from the consumption of both vegetables were much > 1, with HI values of 7.205 and 15.078 due to tomato and cabbage consumption, respectively. This clearly suggests the possible adverse health effect to adult population from the consumption of tomato and cabbage from the study area. The total cancer risk (TCR) analysis have also revealed the potential adverse cancer risk induced by As, Cd, Hg, and Ni from the consumption of both tomato and cabbage as their TCR values were above the threshold level. Based on the results of this study, there would be a significant health risk (both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic) to the consumer associated with the consumption of cabbage and tomato being cultivated in Mojo area. Consequently, we recommend a strict regulatory control on the safety of vegetables originated from the study area."

Cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) are two highly toxic heavy metals, which threaten the health of humans and livestock even at trace levels. These heavy metals may be taken up by plant roots through the protein transporters used for essential minerals such as iron (Fe2+) and copper (Cu2+). Previous studies have shown that some metallic nanoparticles affect the performance of protein transporters and modify the plant uptake of co-existing heavy metal ions. This study aims to understand the role of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) in the uptake pattern of Cd and Pb and two key micronutrients of iron and copper in edible tissues of three leafy green species including spinach (Spinaciae oleracea), parsley (Petroselinum sativum) and cilantro (Coriandrum sativum). Pre-grown plant seedlings in soil (containing Cu and Fe) were transplanted to a hydroponic system (1/4th Hoagland solution) for 7 days as a transition, and then were exposed to four treatments in deionized water (1.0 mg L-1 Cd2++100.0 mg L-1 Pb2+, 1.0 mg L-1 Cd2++100.0 mg L-1 Pb2+ + 100 mg L-1 ZnONPs, 100 mg L-1 ZnO-ENPs and a control with no chemical exposure) for additional two weeks. At termination, shoots were gently separated from the roots, and the concentrations of Pb, Cd, Fe, Zn, and Cu in all plant tissues were quantified by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results revealed that ZnONPs mitigated the uptake of both heavy metals in roots. The translocation of heavy metals was similar in the edible tissues of three species. The response of three leafy greens to the co-exposure of heavy metals and ZnONPs was different in Cu and Fe accumulation in edible tissues. Fe concentration in edible tissues in the co-exposed plants was increased in spinach (+10%) and cilantro (+9%) but decreased in parsley (-8%) compared to controls, while the Cu level in edible tissues increased in all three species following the order of cilantro (+8%)> spinach (+4%)> parsley (+1.5%)."

However, incorporation of biochar at 5% application rate prominently increased the shoot (98.27%) and root (85.96%) dry biomass, net photosynthesis (45.52%), transpiration rate (161.34%), stomatal activity (111.76%) and intracellular CO2 concentration (32.25%) when Cd was added at 20 mg kg-1 soil, relative to the respective treatment without biochar. Whereas, incorporation of biochar at 5% significantly reduced the bioavailable Cd by 16.64% under 20 mg kg-1 soil, compared to respective Cd treatment without biochar. Similarly, Cd accumulation in shoots and roots was decreased by 42.49% and 29.23%, and thereby reduced leaf MDA and H2O2 contents by 21.45% and 31.28%, respectively, at 20 mg Cd kg-1 spiked soil relative to without biochar amended soil.

Vegetables grown conventionally and organically, from Dutch as well as foreign origin were compared. Included were the following vegetable types; blanched celery (n=192), bunched carrots (n=190), butterhead lettuce (n=137), chicory (n=96), endive (n=188), iceberg lettuce (n=193) and radish (n=120). Overall, 3GC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were detected on 5.2% of vegetables. Based on primary habitat and mechanism of 3GC-resistance, these bacteria could be divided into four groups: ESBL-producing faecal species (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp. ), AmpC-producing faecal species (Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp. ), ESBL-producing environmental species (Pantoea spp. , Rahnella aquatilis, Serratia fonticola), and AmpC-producing environmental species (Cedecca spp. , Hafnia alvei, Pantoea spp. , Serratia plymuthica), which were detected on 0.8%, 1.2%, 2.6% and 0.4% of the vegetables analysed, respectively. Contamination with faecal 3GC-resistant bacteria was most frequently observed in root and bulb vegetables (average prevalence 4.4%), and less frequently in stem vegetables (prevalence 1.6%) and leafy greens (average prevalence 0.6%). In Dutch stores, only four of the included vegetable types (blanched celery, bunched carrots, endive, iceberg lettuce) were available in all four possible variants: Dutch/conventional, Dutch/organic, foreign/conventional, foreign/organic. With respect to these vegetable types, no statistically significant difference was observed in prevalence of 3GC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae between country of origin or cultivation type (5.2%, 5.7%, 5.7% and 3.3%, respectively). Vegetables consumed raw may be a source of dissemination of 3GC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and their resistance genes to humans. The magnitude of the associated public health risk presumably depends on the types of bacteria that are ingested, i. e. , faecal or environmental species, and may therefore be higher for root and bulb vegetables compared to leafy greens."

Small, but significant, differences in prevalence were detected based on sample locations. Detection of Salmonella was correlated positively with both significant rain events and, in some environments, levels of generic Escherichia coli. Analysis of 1,936 isolates revealed significant serovar diversity, with 91 different serovars detected. The most common isolated serovars were S. enterica subsp. enterica serovars I 6,8:d:- (406 isolates, 21.0%, and potentially monophasic Salmonella Muenchen), Give (334 isolates, 17.3%), Muenchen (158 isolates, 8.2%), Typhimurium (227 isolates, 11.7%), Oranienburg (106 isolates, 5.5%), and Montevideo (78 isolates, 4%). Sixteen of the 24 most common serovars detected in the region are among the serovars reported to cause the most human salmonellosis in the United States.

Therefore, it is urgent to take soil antimony pollution control measures in the mining area. At the same time, in order to realize the safe use of agricultural land in the mining area, the farmland far away from the low antimony content of the soil in the central area of the mine should be selected as the planting area, and the agricultural products with weak antimony absorption capacity should be planted first."

Soil and crop samples, collected from five study farms, and samples of the river water used for irrigation, were analysed for seven heavy metals Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd and Pb. On the basis of the field data the paper discusses: (1) the potential soil deficiencies and toxicities; (2) the probable links between soil heavy metal levels and fertilisation practices; (3) the heavy metal concentrations in crop tissue in relation to crop growth and human health. The findings suggest that soil concentrations of the seven metals fall within 'typical' soil levels, and that there should not be any problems of either toxicities or deficiencies for crop growth. There was evidence of slight accumulation of Zn, Cu and Cd on some of the farms with a history of town refuse ash use. However, in all farms lettuce crops contained very large concentrations of Fe, and Pb concentrations that were 20 to 40 times higher than the WHO/FAO maximum recommended level in leafy vegetables for human consumption. The Cd content of carrot tissue was 10 times higher than the WHO/FAO recommended limit. The relatively small number of soil and crop samples precluded any formal attempt at correlating the concentrations of heavy metals found in the vegetable crops with the farm levels. Nevertheless, the data suggested that these were not linked. The paper goes on to consider various potential sources of the metals found in the crops, including irrigation water, town refuse ash and air-borne dust, and discusses additional health and environmental risks pertaining to the use of town refuse ash. Undoubtedly, the heavy Pb and Cd contamination of certain crops indicates the urgent need for future studies to ascertain the precise source of these metals, and although the practice of using town refuse ash does not appear to have resulted in large-scale contamination of soil in the farming area, there are a number of unsafe practices associated with it that call for the identification of strategies for the safe utilisation of urban waste in Jos."

A total of 486 conventional and organic leafy green samples that are eaten raw were collected from different areas in Alexandria, evaluated for total E. coli counts (ECCs), and screened for E. coli O157:H7 using conventional and molecular methods. Recovery of E. coli (≥10(2)CFU/g) from all studied types of leafy greens was indicative of fecal contamination. Total ECCs in conventional samples ranged from 5.47 to 2.56 log CFU/g. Based on their inability to ferment sorbitol on CT-SMAC media, 26 presumptive E. coli O157 isolates were detected in 71.4% (270/378) of the studied conventional samples. From all studied organic samples, only 2 types (organic cabbage and parsley, 16.7%) were contaminated with presumptive E. coli O157. All 28 isolates were further serotyped as E. coli O157 by latex agglutination test, and biochemically confirmed as E. coli. Multiplex PCR assays confirmed the ability of 21.4% (6/28) of the E. coli O157 strains to produce shiga-toxins (Stxs), and their virulence markers were as follows: stx1, 66.6% (4/6); stx2, 50% (3/6); stx1/stx2, 16.7% (1/6); eaeA, 83.3% (5/6); and hlyA, 16.7% (1/6). Only 2 strains recovered from conventional and organic parsley could possibly be classified as E. coli O157:H7 based on the presence of stx-genes (either stx1 or stx2 or both). Results of the present research highlight that high E. coli loads, together with recovery of STEC O157 isolates could pose serious health risks to the produce consumers. This emphasizes the urgent need for health authorities to value and utilize the existing knowledge to identify strategies that reduce microbiological risks due to fecal contamination of agricultural products, and implement control measures at all stages of the food chain to specifically eliminate the presence of STEC O157 on the leafy green category."

Thus, this study was aimed to investigate the quality of wastewaters in Hadnet district of Mekelle used to irrigate lettuce, spinach and cauliflower and the safety of the vegetables in terms of accumulation heavy metals. Result Wastewater samples collected from four experimental sites in the district were found to have higher concentrations in 4 (i. e. , Cd, Cr, Cu, and Mn) of the 10 heavy metals tested than the permissible limit estbalished by the FAO (1985). Interestingly, spring water samples collected from another district called Kallamino, designated as comparison site, also have higher concenterations in 4 (i. e. , Al, As, Cd, and Cu) of the 10 heavy metals tested. But the leafy vegetables grown in the least contaminated experimental site was found to have higher concentrations in 6 or 7 of the 10 heavy metals tested. Vegetables grown in the comparison site were nearly clean. The lettuce and spnach had elevated concentration of As and Al, respectively. While the fast growing lettuce has higher accumulation of the heavy metals, the slow growing cauliflower had lower accumulation. Such elevated accumulaion of heavy metals in these vegetables could be due to the presence of higher soil contamination and enahnced bioaccumulation capacity of the plants. Conclusion The wastewater used to irrigate vegetable farms in Hadnet district of Mekelle is not safe enough. More importantly, the soils of the farms might have accumulated far more amount of heavy metals. The lettuce, spinach and cauliflower cultivated there are highly contaminated.

Additionally, broth cultures and IMS beads were streaked onto selective agar plates (Rainbow(®) agar, R&F(®) E. coli O157 Chromogenic medium, TC-SMAC and CHROMagar™ 0157) for isolation of E. coli O157:H7. Both broth cultures and IMS beads were also acid treated in Trypticase Soy Broth pH 2 prior to plating to selective media to improve upon cultural recovery. Although E. coli O157 strains were detected in most samples by PCR after 5 h enrichment, cultural recovery was poor. However, after 24 h enrichment, both PCR and cultural recovery were improved. Acidification of the broths and the IMS beads prior to plating greatly improved recovery from 24 h enrichment broths by suppressing the growth of competing microorganisms. Detection and recovery of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in fresh produce matrices (e. g. , cilantro) can be complicated by high background microflora present in these foods. Rapid detection by molecular methods combined with effective enrichment and isolation procedures such as using immunomagnetic separation (IMS) techniques can quickly identify potential hazards to public health. Additional techniques such as acidification of enrichment broths can exploit acid resistance characteristics of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7, facilitating their isolation in complex food matrices."

This was done by determining the role of artificial leaf damage in terms of damaged leaf area on proliferation of E. coli O157:H7 gfp+. In a two-factorial experiment, unwashed fresh baby leaf spinach (Spinacia oleracea L. ) was subjected to four damage levels (undamaged, low, moderate, high damage; factor 1) and three incubation intervals (0, 1, 2 days post-inoculation; factor 2). Individual leaves were immersed for 15 s in a suspension loaded with E. coli O157:H7 gfp+ (106 CFU × mL-1). The leaves were analyzed individually using image analysis tools to quantify leaf area and number and size of lesions, and using confocal laser scanning and scanning electron microscopy to visualize leaf lesions and presence of the introduced E. coli strain on and within the leaf tissue. Prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 gfp+ was assessed using a culture-dependent technique. The results showed that size of individual lesions and damaged leaf area affected depth of invasion into plant tissue, dispersal to adjacent areas, and number of culturable E. coli O157:H7 gfp+ directly after inoculation. Differences in numbers of the inoculant retrieved from leaf macerate evened out from 2 days post-inoculation, indicating rapid proliferation during the first day post-inoculation. Leaf weight was a crucial factor, as lighter spinach leaves (most likely younger leaves) were more prone to harbor E. coli O157:H7 gfp+, irrespective of damage level. At the high inoculum density used, the risk of consumers' infection was almost 100%, irrespective of incubation duration or damage level. Even macroscopically intact leaves showed a high risk for infection. These results suggest that the risk to consumers is correlated with how early in the food chain the leaves are contaminated, and the degree of leaf damage. These findings should be taken into account in different steps of leafy green processing. Further attention should be paid to the fate of viable, but non-culturable, shiga-toxigenic E. coli on and in ready-to-eat leafy vegetables."

While plants can synthesize phylloquinone de novo, humans rely on vitamin K1 uptake from green leafy vegetables as a precursor for the synthesis of its structural derivative, menaquinone-4 (vitamin K2). In vertebrates, menaquinone-4 serves as an enzymatic co-factor that is required for posttranslational protein modification, i. e. the γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues in specific proteins involved in blood coagulation, bone metabolism and vascular biology. Comprehensive knowledge of the subcellular compartmentalization of vitamin K biosynthesis in plants, pathway regulation and its integration in cellular metabolic networks is important to design functional food with elevated vitamin levels and health benefits to human consumers. It had long been assumed that plants obtained all enzymes for phylloquinone biosynthesis from the ancient cyanobacterial endosymbiont and that, upon gene transfer to the nucleus, all biosynthetic enzymes were re-directed to the plastid. This view, however, has been recently challenged by the exclusive localization of the 6th pathway enzyme (MenB/NS) to peroxisomes in Arabidopsis. Soon afterwards, not only the preceding enzyme, acyl-activating enzyme 14 (MenE/AAE14), but also the succeeding thioesterase (DHNAT) were also shown to be peroxisomal. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a heterogeneous evolutionary origin of the peroxisomal enzymes. Phylloquinone biosynthesis reveals several branching points leading to the synthesis of important defence signalling molecules, such as salicylic acid and benzoic acid derivatives. Recent research data demonstrate that, of the two phenylalanine-dependent pathways for benzoic and salicylic acid biosynthesis, the CoA-dependent β-oxidative pathway, which is peroxisomal, is the major route. Hence, peroxisomes emerge as an important cell compartment for the interconnected networks of phylloquinone, benzoic and salicylic acid biosynthesis. Numerous mechanisms to regulate intermediate flux and the fine-tuned inducible production of secondary metabolites, including signalling molecules, await their characterization at the molecular level."

However, very few studies have attempted to investigate the potential contamination of fresh produce with taeniid eggs and the available methods are not standardized for this purpose. Established protocols do exist for testing leafy greens and berries for contamination with protozoan parasites and are used in national surveillance programmes. This methodology could be suitable for the detection of taeniids. The objective of this project was to develop and standardize a sensitive and reliable method to detect contamination of leafy greens and berries with eggs of zoonotic taeniids and to differentiate between E. multilocularis, E. granulosus (s. l. ) and Taenia spp. We compared the efficacy of different wash solutions to remove Taenia spp. eggs from spiked produce, assessed two DNA extraction kits for their performance on Taenia spp. eggs, and adapted a published conventional multiplex PCR into a real-time PCR with fluorescence melting curve analysis (MCA) that was optimized for use on produce washes. Analytical specificity of this protocol was assessed using non-spiked produce washes as well as a variety of other potentially contaminating parasites. The protocol as established in this study had an analytical sensitivity of detecting five eggs per spiked sample for both romaine lettuce and strawberries. Unequivocal identification of E. multilocularis, E. granulosus (s. l. ) and Taenia spp. was possible through MCA. Amplicon sequencing allowed identification of Taenia to the species level. The real-time PCR also amplified DNA from Dicrocoelium sp. , but with a clearly discernable melting curve profile. The new protocol for screening produce for taeniid contamination was highly sensitive. Melting curve analysis and the possibility of amplicon sequencing made this assay very specific. Once further validated, this method could be employed for surveillance of produce for contamination with taeniid parasites to assess potential risks for consumers."

In particular, the globalization of the food supply may introduce new food safety risks and allow widespread distribution of contaminated food, particularly produce. The objectives of this study were to: (i) compare the overall quality of domestic and Mexican produce throughout the packing process; (ii) examine changes in microbiological quality of both domestic and Mexican produce at each stage of production and processing; and (iii) evaluate the prevalence of select pathogens on fresh produce, including leafy green, herbs, melons, and vegetables. Furthermore, we also sought to characterize the antibiotic resistance profiles of Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis strains isolated from fresh produce. A total of 466 produce and matching environmental swab samples was collected from various locations in packing sheds in the southern US from November 2002 through December 2003. These samples were assayed by enumerative tests for total aerobic bacteria (APC), total coliforms, total Enterococcus, and E. coli. Produce samples were also analyzed for the presence of Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella, and E. coli O157:H7. A total of 112 E. faecium and E. faecalis isolates were further screened for antibiotic resistance using a panel of seventeen antibiotics. Overall, the microbiological quality of fresh produce ranged from 4.0 to 7.9 log(10) CFU/g (APC); less than 1.0 log(10) to 4.5 log(10) CFU/g (coliforms); less than 1.0 log(10) to 4.0 log(10) CFU/g (E. coli); and less than 1.0 log(10) to 5.4 log(10) CFU/g (Enterococcus). No Salmonella, Shigella, or E. coli O157:H7 were detected from the 466 25-g produce samples tested. However, three domestic cabbage samples were found to be positive for L. monocytogenes. Of the Enterococcus isolates, E. faecium had a higher degree of resistance to antibiotics in general, while Enterococcus spp. isolated from Mexican produce had a higher degree of antibiotic resistance when compared to strains isolated from produce samples of domestic origin. Despite increased attention to the role of imported produce in foodborne disease, this study does not support the assumption that domestic produce is of higher microbial quality than Mexican produce."

In this scenario, African indigenous leafy vegetables (AILVs) could help in alleviating hunger and food insecurity. Principally used by smallholder farmers as subsistence crops thanks to the ease of growing, AILVs have been reported to have valuable nutrient content. Nevertheless, rough handling coupled with microbial activities could lead to phyllosphere deterioration, hence leading to spoilage events that make the sustainable supply and consumption of AILVs difficult. Reviewing the literature regarding AILVs' phyllosphere microbiota, some bacteria such as Pseudomonadaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were commonly found. Their ability to deteriorate vegetables is known, thus stressing the necessity to valorize these commodities. In this review, fermentation was deepened as an inexpensive form of food processing to valorize AILVs, modulating the phyllosphere microbiota in favor of fermenting microorganisms. The literature review revealed that traditional methods implying alkaline fermentation lower the levels of toxigenic compounds in AILVs such as cyanhydric acid. Methods involving lactic acid bacteria (LAB) fermentation with beneficial LAB were able to control the fermentation, hindering the proliferation of spoilage (i. e. Pseudomonadaceae) and potentially pathogenic bacteria (i. e. Enterobacteriaceae). Aside, the improvement of nutritional content is achieved, obtaining increased levels of B-group vitamins, carotenoids, and the reduction of antinutrient and toxic compounds for certain AILVs. Furthermore, the AILVs' shelf life is also prolonged, thus further confirming that the final products are valorized by the fermentation processes. Howbeit, this review also points out some weaknesses in the methods. Indeed, alkaline fermentation can allow the growth of toxin-producing Bacillus spp. that can jeopardize the consumers' health. While the unpredictability of spontaneous LAB fermentation caused in some cases the resilience of certain pathogens such as Enterobacteriaceae. More studies involving alternative ways to inoculate LAB starters such as back slopping might be useful to perfect the fermentation methods and finally valorize AILVs."

Both E. coli cocktails were spray-inoculated separately and determined to result in an initial mean population density of log 4.2 CFU/cm². Leaves were harvested as mini-greens approximating commercial maturity, minimally processed in a model washing system treated with 3 mg/L of ClO₂ and stored for 7 days at 5 °C. Rapid decline of generic E. coli and E. coli O157:H7 populations was observed for all plant types regardless of the leaf age at the time of inoculation and the irrigation type across both seasonal growth cycle trials.

Viable populations of E. coli and E. coli O157:H7 were confirmed throughout storage, including the final time point at the end of acceptable visual leaf quality. In this study, the ability of low populations of E. coli to survive during production and postharvest operations in selected mini-greens has been demonstrated.

A field study was conducted at three major sites that were irrigated by either treated or untreated wastewater in the suburban areas of Varanasi, India according to normal practice. Samples of irrigation water, soil, and the edible portion of the palak (Beta vulgaris L. var All green H1) were collected monthly during the summer and winter seasons and were analyzed for Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, Mn, and Ni. Heavy metals in irrigation water were below the internationally recommended (WHO) maximum permissible limits set for agricultural use for all heavy metals except Cd at all the sites. Similarly, the mean heavy metal concentrations in soil were below the Indian standards for all heavy metals, but the maximum value of Cd recorded during January was higher than the standard. However, in the edible portion of B. vulgaris, the Cd concentration was higher than the permissible limits of the Indian standard during summer, whereas Pb and Ni concentrations were higher in both summer and winter seasons. Results of linear regression analysis computed to assess the relationship between individual heavy metal concentration in the vegetable samples and in soil showed that Zn in soil had a positive significant relationship with vegetable contamination during winter. Concentrations of Cd, Cu, and Mn in soil and plant showed significant positive relationships only during summer. Concentration of Cr and Pb during winter season and Zn and Ni during summer season showed significant negative relationships between soil and plant contamination. The study concludes that the use of treated and untreated wastewater for irrigation has increased the contamination of Cd, Pb, and Ni in edible portion of vegetables causing potential health risk in the long term from this practice. The study also points to the fact that adherence to standards for heavy metal contamination of soil and irrigation water does not ensure safe food."

This is the largest number of Bangladeshi food and nonfood samples investigated for their Cd content. High Cd levels were detected in leafy vegetables (mean 31 [SD 29]μg/kg). Of these vegetables, lal shak (Amaranthus tricolor) contained the highest Cd level (303 μg/kg [wet weight]; mean 100.5 [SD 95]μg/kg). Bangladeshi rice also showed significant concentration of Cd (mean 37.2 [SD 30]μg/kg). Of particular concern is the very high level of Cd detected in some puffed rice, which we attribute to the illegal practice of using urea for whitening the puffed rice. Tobacco leaves, which are commonly consumed during betel quid chewing by Bangladeshis, contain significant levels of Cd (mean 95 [SD 87]μg/kg). The total daily intake (TDI) of Cd from foods for Bangladeshis was estimated to be 34.55 μg/d. This is rather high when compared to the TDI of Cd for other populations. Our analysis reveals that this is mainly due to the very high intake of rice and vegetables, and lower consumption of animal products (which are low in Cd), by the Bangladeshis. We also determined the provisional maximum tolerable daily intake and target hazard quotients values for Cd. Clearly a more balanced diet is necessary to reduce the Cd intake in the Bangladeshi population, especially by reducing the very high intake of rice and certain leafy vegetables. Food manufacturing and agricultural practices needs to be altered to reduce the entry of Cd into the food chain. Exposure to high levels of Cd can be harmful to human health and this study provides a comprehensive analysis of Cd levels in a variety of food items from Bangladesh.

Health risk assessment were performed using estimated average daily intake and hazard indices for two weight categories: children (16.7 kg) and adults (60 kg). The results showed that delta-HCH, DDT and methoxychlor were predominantly detected in the two vegetables from both farms and markets. In amaranth, the mean concentration of methoxychlor, DDT and delta-HCH were 4.590 ± 2.774 mg/kg (dry weight (dw)), 0.757 ± 0.457 mg/kg (dw) and 0.577 ± 0.390 mg/kg (dw), respectively, while fluted pumpkin levels were 6.223 ± 2.489 mg/kg dw (methoxychlor), 0.504 ± 0.056 mg/kg dw (delta-HCH) and 0.486 ± 0.123 mg/kg dw (DDT). The levels of HCH and DDT residues were generally above the United Kingdom/European Commission maximum residue limit. The analysis of health risk estimates for non-carcinogenic risk revealed that for both vegetables, the hazard quotient for p, p' DDT and methoxychlor was >1 for both children and adults. The health risk estimates for carcinogenic risk revealed that hazard indices values were >1 for children for both vegetables and alpha-HCH had a hazard index >1 for adults for amaranth. This means the residue exceeds acceptable standard and present potential risk to consumers of these vegetables. The results obtained from the present study indicate that consumption of amaranth contaminated with alpha-HCH could pose a carcinogenic risk for adult consumers. The consumption of the two vegetables could pose both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks to children and adults. Therefore, there is need for strict enforcement of regulations on pesticide usage to minimize human health risks. The authors declare no competing financial interests."

In this study, we investigated and recorded the relationship between birds near leafy green fields and the risk for contaminated irrigation water or leafy green plants. We monitored the presence of birds for over two years and performed cloacal swab analysis for non-pathogenic Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonellaenterica, while also monitoring the incidence of other microbial indicators. We also assessed the risks from bird feces by performing observations in a commercial field reported with Salmonella positive samples and by analyzing the survival of foodborne pathogens in bird feces. Our results showed that most of the birds near the crop fields were resident small birds. We did not observe a correlation between the number of birds in sites and the incidence of indicator bacteria (e. g. , coliforms, E. coli) in irrigation canal water, with the exception of one out of four sites where water flow was low or stagnant. Using walk-in-traps, 305 birds were captured and placed in short-term captivity to determine the presence of various bacteria. None of the birds tested positive for E. coli O157:H7 or Salmonella. However, nearly 40% of the birds captured were confirmed positive for non-pathogenic E. coli. We found no correlation between age (young, adult, unknown), gender (male, female, unknown) and the incidence of E. coli positive birds, but we observed significantly higher probability of incidence during October-December. The role of relative humidity and temperature on bacterial survival appeared to play a key role in the survival of Salmonella on the leaves of spinach plants in a commercial field. This was also confirmed in laboratory conditions where Salmonella inoculated in bird feces and exposed to 15 °C and 80% RH(Relative humidity) survived beyond 133 days, while at 26 °C and 40% RH, the organism was undetectable after 63 days. Our results suggest that local birds associated with leafy green fields likely pose a minimal impact of risk for food contamination, but also points out the need for increased analysis specifically for E. coli O157:H7. Furthermore, our study suggests the need for expanding research that addresses risks associated with large migratory birds, especially in areas where stagnated water sources would be used for overhead sprinkle irrigation."

Doses to five organs/tissues at significant risk from exposure to radioactive fallout (i. e. , active bone marrow, thyroid gland, lungs, stomach, and colon) from the 63 most important radionuclides in fresh fallout from external and internal irradiation were estimated. The organ doses were estimated for four resident ethnic groups in New Mexico (Whites, Hispanics, Native Americans, and African Americans) in seven age groups using: (1) assessment models described in a companion paper, (2) data on the spatial distribution and magnitude of radioactive fallout derived from historical documents, and (3) data collected on diets and lifestyles in 1945 from interviews and focus groups conducted in 2015-2017 (described in a companion paper). The organ doses were found to vary widely across the state with the highest doses directly to the northeast of the detonation site and at locations close to the center of the Trinity fallout plume. Spatial heterogeneity of fallout deposition was the largest cause of variation of doses across the state with lesser differences due to age and ethnicity, the latter because of differences in diets and lifestyles. The exposure pathways considered included both external irradiation from deposited fallout and internal irradiation via inhalation of airborne radionuclides in the debris cloud as well as resuspended ground activity and ingestion of contaminated drinking water (derived both from rivers and rainwater cisterns) and foodstuffs including milk products, beef, mutton, and pork, human-consumed plant products including leafy vegetables, fruit vegetables, fruits, and berries. Tables of best estimates of county population-weighted average organ doses by ethnicity and age are presented. A discussion of our estimates of uncertainty is also provided to illustrate a lower and upper credible range on our best estimates of doses. Our findings indicate that only small geographic areas immediately downwind to the northeast received exposures of any significance as judged by their magnitude relative to natural radiation. The findings presented are the most comprehensive and well-described estimates of doses received by populations of New Mexico from the Trinity nuclear test."

As microbiological safety surveillance in South Africa is limited, a total of 545 vegetable samples (spinach, tomato, lettuce, cucumber, and green beans) were purchased from retailers, street traders, trolley vendors and farmers' markets. Escherichia coli, coliforms and Enterobacteriaceae were enumerated and the prevalence of Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes determined. E. coli isolates were characterized phenotypically (antibiotic resistance) and genotypically (diarrheagenic virulence genes). Coliforms, E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae counts were mostly not significantly different between formal and informal markets, with exceptions noted on occasion. When compared to international standards, 90% to 98% tomatoes, 70% to 94% spinach, 82% cucumbers, 93% lettuce, and 80% green bean samples, had satisfactory (≤ 100 CFU/g) E. coli counts. Of the 545 vegetable samples analyzed, 14.86% (n = 81) harbored E. coli, predominantly from leafy green vegetables. Virulence genes (lt, st, bfpA, eagg, eaeA, stx1, stx2, and ipaH) were not detected in the E. coli isolates (n = 67) characterized, however 40.30% were multidrug-resistant.

This study highlights the need for continued surveillance of multidrug resistant foodborne pathogens in fresh produce retailed formally and informally for potential consumer health risks. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The results indicate that the microbiological quality of different vegetables were similar per product type, regardless of being purchased from formal retailers or informal street traders, trolley vendors or farmers' markets. Although no pathogenic bacteria (diarrheagenic E. coli, Salmonella spp. or L. monocytogenes) were isolated, high levels of multidrug-resistance was observed in the generic E. coli isolates. These findings highlight the importance of microbiological quality surveillance of fresh produce in formal and informal markets, as these products can be a reservoir of multidrug resistant bacteria harboring antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, potentially impacting human health."

A combination of single factor evaluation and Nemero Index analysis was employed to determine specific heavy metals exceeding allowable standards and analyze the characteristics of pollution. Risk of exposure was utilized to assess human health risks originating from eating locally planted vegetables contaminated by heavy metals. The results showed that contents of Cu,Zn in the 8 sorts of vegetables were below the standards of maximum allowable content and the contents of heavy mental Cr of up to 91.67% vegetable samples were higher than their standard. Lettuce sativa var. angustana Irish,Luffa acutangula L. ,Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. and Daucus carota L. were the 4 species of Pb exceeding vegetables,with the exceed ratio reaching up to 35.71% and Daucus carota L. exceeded the target value most seriously. Only the content of Cd in Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. was over-standard,with the rate of 31.25%. And the highest rate of over-standard of the content of Ni in 3 species of vegetables,which included Lactuca sativa L. ,Ipomoea aquatica Forsk and Brassica parachinensis,reached 8.33%. For the contamination level of the eight kinds of vegetable,Lactuca sativa L. ,Ipomoea aquatica Forsk,Brassica parachinensis,Raphanus sativus L. and Daucus carota L. were put into the class of alarming,while Lettuce sativa var. angustana Irish,Luffa acutangula L. and Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. were classified as secure. Heavy metals' comprehensive pollution degree of 4 species of vegetables presented a trend of leafy vegetables >rootstalk vegetables >stem vegetables >solanaceous fruits. Health risk assessment showed that Guangzhou citizens eat more frequently Ipomoea aquatica Forsk and Lactuca sativa L. and Brassica parachinensis were prone to higher accumulation of heavy metals,and the dietary intake of heavy metal Cr might cause harm to human health and intake of Cd would bring potential health risk to the human body.

While a number of studies have investigated pathogen reduction on the surfaces of leafy greens during the postharvest washing process, there remains a paucity of data on the level of treatment needed to inactivate viruses in the wash water, which is critical for preventing cross-contamination. The objective of this study was to quantify the susceptibility of hNoV genotype I (GI), hNoV GII, murine norovirus (MNV), and bacteriophage MS2 to free chlorine in whole leaf, chopped romaine, and shredded iceberg lettuce industrial leafy green wash waters, each sampled three times over a 4-month period. A suite of kinetic inactivation models was fit to the viral reduction data to aid in quantification of concentration-time (CT) values. Results indicate that 3-log10 infectivity reduction was achieved at CT values of less than 0.2 mg · min/liter for MNV and 2.5 mg · min/liter for MS2 in all wash water types. CT values for 2-log10 molecular reduction of hNoV GI in whole leaf and chopped romaine wash waters were 1.5 and 0.9 mg · min/liter, respectively. For hNoV GII, CT values were 13.0 and 7.5 mg · min/liter, respectively. In shredded iceberg wash water, 3-log10 molecular reduction was not observed for any virus over the time course of experiments. These findings demonstrate that noroviruses may exhibit genogroup-dependent resistance to free chlorine and emphasize the importance of distinguishing between genogroups in hNoV persistence studies. IMPORTANCE Postharvest washing of millions of pounds of leafy greens is performed daily in industrial processing facilities with the intention of removing dirt, debris, and pathogenic microorganisms prior to packaging. Modest inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms (less than 2 log10) is known to occur on the surfaces of leafy greens during washing. Therefore, the primary purpose of the sanitizing agent is to maintain microbial quality of postharvest processing water in order to limit cross-contamination. This study modeled viral inactivation data and quantified the free-chlorine CT values that processing facilities must meet in order to achieve the desired level of hNoV GI and GII reduction. Disinfection experiments were conducted in industrial leafy green wash water collected from a full-scale fresh produce processing facility in the United States, and hNoV GI and GII results were compared with surrogate molecular and infectivity data."

Fresh, ready-to-eat produce such as leafy greens and salad mixes are considered potential transmission vehicles for Giardia infection in humans. Therefore, a specific, sensitive, and reliable method for Giardia detection in leafy greens is needed. We optimized washing procedures for the recovery of Giardia cysts from leafy greens and adapted and validated an existing EF1α LAMP assay for the detection of Giardia DNA to support routine diagnostic surveillance and disease outbreak investigations. Four leafy green types (35 ± 1 g) were spiked with 100 Giardia cysts and we compared washing by shaking with 1 M glycine (n = 20) or 0.1% Alconox (n = 20). DNA was extracted from washes, tested by LAMP and melt curve analysis, and time to positive (TTP) values compared. The detection limit was determined by spiking 10 (n = 40) Giardia cysts onto these same types of leafy greens and processing as above with 0.1% Alconox. Method robustness was assessed by subjecting spring mix (n = 45 total) to aging (1, 3 or 7 days) and washes to aging and freezing conditions prior to testing. Assay repeatability and specificity were evaluated, and an artificial positive control (APC) distinguishable by melt temperature (Tm) from DNA of Giardia spiked on leafy greens was designed to rule out cross-contamination from the control. Giardia detection rates were higher and TTP was lower (P < 0.05) for 0.1% Alconox (19/20, 8.85 ± 0.3 min) compared with 1 M glycine (15/20, 14.53 ± 7.2 min). The LAMP assay detected 10 Giardia cysts spiked on leafy greens in 13-34 min in 14/40 samples tested. Robustness assessment showed that TTP was higher (P < 0.0001) when spiked produce was stored for 7 days (13.09 ± 1.14 min) compared to fresh (9.72 ± 0.43 min). No unspiked samples were positive by LAMP, and the Tm for DNA of Giardia spiked on leafy greens was higher (P < 0.0001, 87.43 ± 0.05 °C) than the APC (86.43 ± 0.12 °C).

Heavy metals are not readily eliminated by degradation, and thus remediation of contaminated media (soil, sediment and water/sludge) requires the outright removal or cleanup of these metals. Evaluation of the performance and cost efficiency of various remediation methods has led to the development of bioremediation as an inexpensive, innovative and environmentally friendly cleanup strategy. The present study was designed to assess the Pb remediation potential of wild Senna obtusifolia (Sicklepod), in Dareta Village, Zamfara, Nigeria. Soil and Senna obtusifolia samples were collected from established plots and Pb content was determined using a Shimadzu atomic absorption spectrophotometer (model AA-6800, Japan) after wet digestion. The mean concentrations of Pb (mg/kg) in soil, roots, stems and leaves, respectively, were 130.68±5.2, 61.33±17.86, 66.64±18.10 and 173.39±13.73 for plot 1, 287.84±6.5, 69.42±11.62, 123.4±3.67 and 294.28±4.38 for plot 2, 315.73±4.13, 68.42±10.22, 86.89±6.08 and 290.61±7.47 for plot 3, 396.86±5.48, 91.64±2.87, 150.58±2.21 and 282.53±5.69 for plot 4 and 264.23±8.02, 72.71±2.18, 124.60±2.27 and 282.40±3.79 for plot 5. Average values for the translocation factor, bioaccumulation factor and bioconcentration factor were 3.65±0.66, 1.01±0.23 and 0.29±0.10, respectively. Soil Pb levels in the present study were found to be within the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) standards and the Dutch Intervention Values for Pb in soil. Lead content of Senna obtusifolia leaves was found to be higher than the Pb content of the stem and root, indicating relatively low restriction and the efficiency of internal transport of the toxic metal from the roots towards the aerial parts.

The mean Pb concentration of Senna obtusifolia leaves was found to be far above Codex general standards and the European Union (EU) maximum levels for Pb in leafy vegetables. The study concludes that wild Senna obtusifolia has significant characteristics for phytoextraction of Pb and that consumption of Senna obtusifolia leaves from the study area would pose a serious risk of Pb intoxication.

The objectives of this study were to isolate, serotype, and genetically characterize Salmonella spp. from Zarqa river and King Talal dam waters, vegetables irrigated by such waters, and manure of poultry and livestock farms located in the Zarqa river basin in Jordan. In addition, certain virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance patterns of isolated Salmonella strains were determined. A total of 250 samples were cultured using routine microbiological methods. Suspected Salmonella spp. were identified based on colony morphology and confirmed using biochemical and molecular methods. Virulence genes including invA, stn, and pCT plasmid were detected using multiplex PCR. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). In total, 32/250 (12.8%) Salmonella spp. isolates were recovered from different sources. Of these, the most common serotype was Salmonella subspecies 1 (23 isolates), followed by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (4 isolates), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (3 isolates), and finally Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (2 isolates). The PFGE indicated that Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolated from poultry manure and from parsley were closely related (84.6%). Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis isolated from the dam water was closely related to Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis isolated from spearmint (73.8%). Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi isolated from the river and dam water were 100% related to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi isolated from lettuce. In the antimicrobial sensitivity test, 14 out of 32 (43.8%) isolated Salmonella strains were resistant to two or more of the major antimicrobial agent groups. However, the majority of isolates were sensitive to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, and gentamicin (97%, 93.8%, and 87.5%, 84.4%, respectively). All isolates were resistant to erythromycin and amoxicillin. Results of this study indicate a serious potential threat to public health associated with consuming leafy green vegetables grown on the banks of Zarqa river and its dam because of widespread Salmonella spp. contamination.

Current FDA detection protocols require extensive analysis time. Development of methods for rapid detection of STECs in the field are imperative to maintain food safety. We aimed to use Oxford Nanopore rapid sequencing kits for an in-field determination of agricultural water microbiome and possible detection and characterization of STECs strain(s) in these samples. Results We tested the performance of the nanopore rapid sequencing kit (RAD004) for fast microbiome determination using the well characterized ZymoBIOMICS mock microbial community and the number of reads for each identified species was present in the expected proportion. Rapid sequencing kit (LRK001 and RAD004) library preparation of DNA extracted from agricultural water resulted in poor nanopore sequencing reactions, with low output (0.3–1.7 M reads), a high proportion of failed reads (50–60%), and highly sheared DNA before and after a magnetic bead clean up. To improve performance, we prepared a DNA library with the ligation kit (LSK109), which includes multiple cleaning steps, reducing inherent inhibitors and producing a better outcome (2.2 M reads, 15% failed reads). Metagenomic composition of four sample sites determined using the ligation kit, showed a highly diverse bacterial community for each site, with 11 total genera identified, including Synechococcus and Cyanobium. No definitive presence of STEC could be confirmed in any of the sites. Approximately 100 reads from each site (0.02% of total reads) were identified as Escherichia coli , but the specific strain or their virulence genes could not be detected. Sites 9, 10, and 12 were found to be positive for STEC presence by microbiological techniques after enrichment. Conclusions The rapid sequencing kits can be appropriate for genus or species level microbial identification, but we recommend the use of the ligation kit for increased sequencing depth and removal of contaminants in agricultural water. However, we were not able to identify any STEC strains in these nanopore microbiome samples, due to low initial concentrations. The results from this pilot study provide preliminary evidence that MinION sequencing of agricultural water using the ligation kit has the potential to be used for rapid microbiome determination in the field with optimal results for water quality surveillance."

In the present study, nitrate concentrations in the commonly consumed fruit and vegetable species were determined, and the results, together with the groundwater nitrate levels, were used to assess the associated health risks for Mashhad city residents. For this assessment, 261 water samples and 16 produce types were used to compute the daily intake of nitrate. Nitrate in groundwater was analyzed using a spectrophotometer, and produce species were examined using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography. Ward's hierarchical cluster analysis was applied for categorizing produce samples with regard to their nitrate content. Additionally, to account for the sanitation hazards associated with groundwater quality for drinking purposes, total coliform and turbidity were also assessed using the membrane filter (MF) technique and a nephelometer, respectively. Nitrate concentrations exceeded the prescribed permissible limits in 42% of the groundwater wells. The outcomes also exhibit significantly higher nitrate accumulation levels in root-tuber vegetables and leafy vegetables compared to fruit vegetables and fruits. Using cluster analysis, the accumulation of nitrate in vegetables and fruits was categorized into four clusters, specifying that radish contributes to 65.8% of the total content of nitrate in all samples. The Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) of nitrate and Health Risk Index (HRI) associated with consumption of groundwater exceeded the prescribed limit for the children's target group in Mashhad's south and central parts. Likewise, EDI and HRI values for produce consumption, in most samples, were found to be in the tolerable range, except for radish, lettuce, and cabbage, potentially posing risks for both children and adult consumers. The total coliforms in groundwater were found to violate the prescribed limit at 78.93% of the sampling locations and were generally much higher over the city's central and southern areas. A relatively strong correlation (R2 = 0.6307) between total coliform and nitrate concentrations suggests the release of anthropogenic pollution (i. e. , sewage and manure) in the central and southern Mashhad."

The products were stored at 5 and 12 °C until their labeled ""Best If Used By"" dates, and the microbial counts and product quality were monitored periodically. The results indicate that storage at 5 °C allowed E. coli O157:H7 to survive, but limited its growth, whereas storage at 12 °C facilitated the proliferation of E. coli O157:H7. There was more than 2.0 log CFU/g increase in E. coli O157:H7 populations on lettuce when held at 12 °C for 3 d, followed by additional growth during the remainder of the storage period. Although there was eventually a significant decline in visual quality of lettuce held at 12 °C, the quality of this lettuce was still fully acceptable when E. coli O157:H7 growth reached a statistically significant level. Therefore, maintaining fresh-cut products at 5 °C or below is critical for reducing the food safety risks as E. coli O157:H7 grows at a rapid, temperature-dependent rate prior to significant quality deterioration. Specific information regarding the effect of temperature on pathogen growth on leafy greens is needed to develop science-based food safety guidelines and practices by the regulatory agencies and produce industry. Temperature control is commonly thought to promote quality of leafy greens, not safety, based at least partially on a theory that product quality deterioration precedes pathogen growth at elevated temperatures. This prevalent attitude results in temperature abuse incidents being frequently overlooked in the supply chain. This study demonstrates that human pathogens, such as E. coli O157:H7, can grow significantly on commercially packaged lettuce salads while the product's visual quality is fully acceptable. Packaged fresh-cut salads are marketed as ""ready-to-eat"" while lacking an effective pathogen kill step during their preparation.

With the increase in sensitivity of the detection methodology, there is an increasing concern about the interpretation of positive NoV results by real-time amplification. Strategies to confirm the results by real-time RT-PCR should be developed in analogy with the detection of microbial pathogens in foods.

Further, previously flooded soils should not be replanted for 60 days. In this study, the suitability of the LGMA metrics for farms in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States was evaluated. The upper end of a spinach bed (in Beltsville, MD) established on a -5% grade was flooded with water containing 6 log CFU/ml Escherichia coli to model a worst-case scenario of bacterial movement through soil. Escherichia coli prevalence in soil and on foliar tissue was determined by most probable number (MPN) analysis at distances up to 9 m from the edge of the flood for 63 days. While E. coli was quickly detected at the 9-m distance within 1 day in the spring trial and within 3 days in the fall trial, no E. coli was detected on plants outside the flood zone after 14 days. On day 63 for the two trials, E. coli populations in the flood zone soil were higher in the fall than in the spring. Regression analysis predicted that the time required for a 3-log MPN/g (dry weight) decrease in E. coli populations inside the flood zone was within the 60-day LGMA guideline in the spring but would require 90 days in the fall.

The virus is stable on the leaf surface for at least 2 weeks; however, the dynamics of virus internalization have not been fully investigated. The purpose of this study was to assess the internalization and distribution of HuNoV and two surrogate viruses, porcine sapovirus (SaV) and Tulane virus (TV), in lettuce and spinach. Viral inoculations through the roots of seedlings and the petiole of leaves from mature plants were performed, and the viruses were tracked on days 1 and 6 post-root inoculation and at 16 h and 72 h post-petiole inoculation. Confocal microscopy was used to visualize root-internalized HuNoV. In both lettuce and spinach, (i) HuNoV was internalized into the roots and leaves at similar RNA titers, whereas surrogate viruses were more restricted to the roots, (ii) all three viruses were stable inside the roots and leaves for at least 6 days, and (iii) HuNoV disseminated similarly inside the central veins and leaf lamina, whereas surrogate viruses were more restricted to the central veins. Infectious TV, but not SaV, was detectable in all tissues, suggesting that TV has greater stability than SaV. HuNoV was visualized inside the roots' vascular bundle and the leaf mesophyll of both plants. In conclusion, using surrogate viruses may underestimate the level of HuNoV internalization into edible leaves. The internalization of HuNoV through roots and cut leaves and the dissemination into various spinach and lettuce tissues raise concerns of internal contamination through irrigation and/or wash water. IMPORTANCE Human noroviruses are the leading cause of foodborne outbreaks, with lettuce being implicated in the majority of outbreaks. The virus causes acute gastroenteritis in all age groups, with more severe symptoms in children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients, contributing to over 200,000 deaths worldwide annually. The majority of deaths due to HuNoV occur in the developing world, where limited sanitation exists along with poor wastewater treatment facilities, resulting in the contamination of water resources that are often used for irrigation. Our study confirms the ability of lettuce and spinach to internalize HuNoV from contaminated water through the roots into the edible leaves. Since these leafy greens are consumed with minimal processing that targets only surface pathogens, the internalized HuNoV presents an added risk to consumers. Thus, preventive measures should be in place to limit the contamination of irrigation water. In addition, better processing technologies are needed to inactivate internalized viral pathogens."

The highest level of in planta colonisation occurred on alfalfa sprouts, though internalisation was 10-times more prevalent in the leafy vegetables than in sprouted seeds. Marked differences in in planta growth meant that growth potential could only be inferred for STEC for sprouted seeds. In contrast, biofilm formation in extracts related to spinach colonisation. Overall, the capacity of E. coli to colonise, grow and internalise within plants or plant-derived matrices were influenced by the isolate type, plant species, plant tissue type and temperature, complicating any straight-forward relationship between in vitro and in planta behaviours. Fresh produce is an important vehicle for STEC transmission and experimental evidence shows that STEC can colonise plants as secondary hosts, but differences in the capacity to colonise occur between different plant species and tissues. Therefore, an understanding of the impact of these plant factors have on the ability of STEC to grow and establish is required for food safety considerations and risk assessment. Here, we determined whether growth and the ability of STEC to form biofilms in plants extracts could be related to specific plant metabolites or could predict the ability of the bacteria to colonise living plants. Growth rates for sprouted seeds (alfalfa and fenugreek) exhibited a positive relationship between plant extracts and living plants, but not for leafy vegetables (lettuce and spinach).

Whole genome sequencing generation of closed bacterial genomes plays an important role in source tracking. We aimed to determine the limits of detection and classification of STECs by qPCR and nanopore sequencing using enriched irrigation water artificially contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 (EDL933). We determined the limit of STEC detection by qPCR to be 30 CFU/reaction, which is equivalent to 10 5 CFU/ml in the enrichment. By using Oxford Nanopore’s EPI2ME WIMP workflow and de novo assembly with Flye followed by taxon classification with a k-mer analysis software (Kraken), E. coli O157:H7 could be detected at 10 3 CFU/ml (68 reads) and a complete fragmented E. coli O157:H7 metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) was obtained at 10 5 -10 8 CFU/ml. Using a custom script to extract the E. coli reads, a completely closed MAG was obtained at 10 7 -10 8 CFU/ml and a complete, fragmented MAG was obtained at 10 5 -10 6 CFU/ml. In silico virulence detection for E. coli MAGs for 10 5 -10 8 CFU/ml showed that the virulotype was indistinguishable from the spiked E. coli O157:H7 strain. We further identified the bacterial species in the un-spiked enrichment, including antimicrobial resistance genes, which could have important implications to food safety. We propose this workflow could be used for detection and complete genomic characterization of STEC from a complex microbial sample and could be applied to determine the limit of detection and assembly of other foodborne bacterial pathogens. Foodborne illness caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) ranges in severity from diarrhea to hemolytic uremic syndrome and produce-related incidence is increasing. The pervasive nature of E. coli requires not only detection, but also a complete genome to determine potential pathogenicity based on stx and eae genes, serotype, and other virulence factors. We have developed a pipeline to determine the limits of nanopore sequencing for STECs in a metagenomic sample. By utilizing the current qPCR in the FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) Chapter 4A, we can quantify the amount of STEC in the enrichment and then sequence and classify the STEC in less than half the time as current protocols that require a single isolate.

The main reservoir for EHEC is cattle, but plant-based foods are common vectors for human infection. Several outbreaks have been attributed to lettuce and leafy green vegetables grown in the Salinas and Santa Maria regions of California. Bacteria causing different outbreaks are mostly not close relatives, but one group of closely-related O157:H7 has caused several of them. This unusual pattern of recurrence may have some genetic basis. Here I use whole-genome sequences to reconstruct the genetic changes that occurred in the recent ancestry of this EHEC. In a short period of time corresponding to little genetic change, there were several changes to adhesion-related sequences, mainly adhesins. These changes may have greatly altered the adhesive properties of the bacteria. Possible consequences include increased persistence of cattle infections, more bacteria shed in cattle feces, and greater virulence in humans. Similar constellations of genetic change, which are detectable by current sequencing-based surveillance, may identify other bacteria that are particular threats to human health. In addition, the Santa Maria subclade carries a nonsense mutation affecting ArsR, a repressor of genes that confer resistance to arsenic and antimony. This suggests that the persistent source of Santa Maria contamination is located in an area with arsenic-contaminated groundwater, a problem in many parts of California. This inference may aid identification of the reservoir of EHEC, which would greatly aid mitigation efforts. IMPORTANCE Food-borne bacterial infections cause substantial illness and death. Understanding how bacteria contaminate food and cause disease is important for combating the problem. Closely-related E. coli, likely originating in cattle, have repeatedly caused outbreaks spread by vegetables grown in California. Such recurrence is atypical, and might have a genetic basis. The genetic changes that occurred in the recent ancestry of these E. coli can be reconstructed from their DNA sequences. Several mutations affect genes involved in bacterial adhesion. These might affect persistence of infection in cattle, quantity of bacteria in their feces, and human disease. They also suggest a way of detecting dangerous bacteria from their genome sequences. Furthermore, a subgroup carries a mutation affecting the regulation of genes conferring arsenic resistance. This suggests that the reservoir for contamination utilizes groundwater contaminated with arsenic, a problem in parts of California. This observation may be an aid to locating the persistent reservoir of contamination."

Overall, the capacity of E. coli to colonize, grow, and be internalized within plants or plant-derived matrices was influenced by the isolate type, plant species, plant tissue type, and temperature, complicating any straightforward relationship between in vitro and in planta behaviors. IMPORTANCE Fresh produce is an important vehicle for STEC transmission, and experimental evidence shows that STEC can colonize plants as secondary hosts, but differences in the capacity to colonize occur between different plant species and tissues. Therefore, an understanding of the impact that these plant factors have on the ability of STEC to grow and establish is required for food safety considerations and risk assessment. Here, we determined whether growth and the ability of STEC to form biofilms in plant extracts could be related to specific plant metabolites or could predict the ability of the bacteria to colonize living plants. Growth rates for sprouted seeds (alfalfa and fenugreek) but not those for leafy vegetables (lettuce and spinach) exhibited a positive relationship between plant extracts and living plants. Therefore, the detailed variations at the level of the bacterial isolate, plant species, and tissue type all need to be considered in risk assessment."

{'lettuce': ['Escherichia coli', 'Salmonella']}</s>","Commercial leafy greens customers often require a negative preharvest pathogen test, typically by compositing 60 produce sample grabs of 150 to 375 g total mass from lots of various acreages. This study developed a preharvest sampling Monte Carlo simulation, validated it against literature and experimental trials, and used it to suggest improvements to sampling plans. The simulation was validated by outputting six simulated ranges of positive samples that contained the experimental number of positive samples (range, 2 to 139 positives) recovered from six field trials with point source, systematic, and sporadic contamination. We then evaluated the relative performance between simple random, stratified random, or systematic sampling in a 1-acre field to detect point sources of contamination present at 0.3% to 1.7% prevalence. Randomized sampling was optimal because of lower variability in probability of acceptance. Optimized sampling was applied to detect an industry-relevant point source [3 log(CFU/g) over 0.3% of the field] and widespread contamination [-1 to -4 log(CFU/g) over the whole field] by taking 60 to 1,200 sample grabs of 3 g. More samples increased the power of detecting point source contamination, as the median probability of acceptance decreased from 85% with 60 samples to 5% with 1,200 samples. Sampling plans with larger total composite sample mass increased power to detect low-level, widespread contamination, as the median probability of acceptance with -3 log(CFU/g) contamination decreased from 85% with a 150-g total mass to 30% with a 1,200-g total mass. Therefore, preharvest sampling power increases by taking more, smaller samples with randomization, up to the constraints of total grabs and mass feasible or required for a food safety objective. IMPORTANCE This study addresses a need for improved preharvest sampling plans for pathogen detection in leafy green fields by developing and validating a preharvest sampling simulation model, avoiding the expensive task of physical sampling in many fields. Validated preharvest sampling simulations were used to develop guidance for preharvest sampling protocols. Sampling simulations predicted that sampling plans with randomization are less variable in their power to detect low-prevalence point source contamination in a 1-acre field. Collecting larger total sample masses improved the power of sampling plans in detecting widespread contamination in 1-acre fields. Hence, the power of typical sampling plans that collect 150 to 375 g per composite sample can be improved by taking more, randomized smaller samples for larger total sample mass. The improved sampling plans are subject to feasibility constraints or to meet a particular food safety objective."

We, therefore, studied the effect of selected organic and inorganic amendments on the solubility of zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) in polluted soil and enhancing the efficacy of phytoextraction of these metals by Indian mustard (Brassica juncea cv. Pusa Vijay). For this purpose, a greenhouse experiment was conducted using a metal-polluted soil to evaluate the effect of amendments, viz. green manure (T2), EDTA (T3), sulfur (S)+S oxidizing bacteria (Thiobacillus spp. ) (T4), metal-solubilizing bacteria (Pseudomonas spp. ) (T5), and green manure + metal-solubilizing bacteria (T6), on solubility and bioavailability of Zn, Cd, and Pb. Distribution of metals in different soil fractions revealed that Cd content in water soluble + exchangeable fraction increased to the extent of 34.1, 523, 133, 123, and 75.8% in T2, T3, T4, T5, and T6 treatments, respectively, over control (T1). Cadmium concentrations in soil solution as extracted by Rhizon sampler were recorded as 3.78, 88.1, 11.2, 6.29, and 4.27 μg L-1in T2, T3, T4, T5, and T6, respectively, whereas soil solution concentration of Cd in T1 was 0.99 μg L-1. Activities of Cd (pCd2+) in Baker soil extract were 12.2, 10.9, 6.72, 7.74, 7.67, and 7.05 for T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, and T6, respectively. Cadmium contents in shoot were recorded as 2.74, 3.12, 4.03, 4.55, 4.68, and 4.63 mg kg-1 in T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, and T6 treatments, respectively. Similar trend in Zn and Pb content with different magnitude was also observed across the different amendments. Cadmium uptake by shoot of mustard was enhanced to the extent of 125, 62.5, 175, 175, and 212% grown on T2-, T3-, T4-, T5-, and T6-treated soil, respectively, over T1. By and large, free ion activity of metals as measured by Baker soil test proved to be the most effective index for predicting Zn, Cd, and Pb content in shoot of mustard, followed by EDTA and DTPA. Among the metal fractions, only water soluble + exchangeable metal contributed positively towards plant uptake, which explained the variation in shoot Zn, Cd, and Pb content to the extent of 74, 81, and 87%, respectively, along with other soil metal fractions. Risk to human health for intake of metals through the consumption of leafy vegetable (mustard) grown on polluted soil in terms of hazard quotient (HQ) ranged from 0.64 to 1.10 for Cd and 0.11 to 0.34 for Pb, thus rendering mustard unfit for the human consumption. Novelty of the study mainly consisted of the use of natural means and microorganisms for enhancing solubility of metals in soil with the ultimate aim of hastening the phytoremediation."

The sources and distribution of heavy metals in farmland soils were analyzed using Kriging spatial interpolation and principal component analysis, and the ecological risk was evaluated using the single factor index, comprehensive pollution index, and potential ecological risk index. The results showed that the surrounding farmland soils in the closed Manganese mining area presented serious pollution of Cd, Zn, As, and Mn, in which the average contents of the above heavy metals in the dry land soil in the polluted area were 6.22, 612.28, 37.72, and 1506.2 mg·kg-1, respectively. Compared with the soil risk screening value of agricultural land, the over-standard rates of Cd, Zn, and As were 88.41%, 94.20%, and 84.06%, respectively, and the average content of Mn in the farmland soil was three times that of the background value in the Hunan soil; however, the heavy metal pollution in the paddy field was relatively light. The principal component analysis showed that the sources of Cd, Mn, and Zn in the farmland soil were related to the manganese ore mining, whereas the source of As in the farmland soil might originate from agricultural activities. The pollution area was at a heavy pollution level, and the main pollution factors were Cd, Mn, and Zn. The Cd in the farmland soil could pose a strong potential ecological risk, but the rest of the heavy metals presented only a slight potential ecological risk. The content of Cr, Pb, and Cd in the crops in the study area exceeded the standard, and the exceeding standard rate was between 1.1% and 37.3%, where the average content of over-standard heavy metals in corn was higher than that in rice, and the average content of heavy metals in leafy vegetables was higher than that in root vegetables. The soil pollution degree of heavy metals could affect the accumulation ability of crops, and different crops had different accumulation abilities. For instance, leafy vegetables and root vegetables easily accumulated Cd and Zn; however, rice and corn separately enriched Cd and Cr, as well as Zn and Cu. The contents of heavy metals in dryland soils had a positive correlation with the content of heavy metals in corresponding crops. The contents of Cd and As in the paddy field and rice presented a positive correlation, but the remaining six heavy metal contents in rice (i. e. , Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pb) did not correlate with the content of the paddy fields."

Hereby, we aimed to assess how the colonization and internalization of Salmonella spp. (i) vary with the type of leafy green, the storage conditions (temperature, time), and Salmonella serovar at phenotypic and gene transcriptional level (regarding stress- and virulence- or type III secretion system [T3SS]-associated genes) and (ii) potentially impact the survival of the pathogen against subsequent exposure at lethal pH (2.7), mimicking the gastric acidity. Internalized Salmonella reached 3.0 to 5.0 log CFU/g depending on storage conditions and vegetable, with spinach and chicory allowing the highest (P < 0.05) internalization. Prolonged storage (48 h) at 20°C increased the recovery of internalized Salmonella in spinach and green amaranth by 1.0 to 1.5 log units. Colonization of Salmonella on/in leafy vegetables induced the transcription (maximum fold change [FCmax], ∼2,000) of T3SS-related genes. Interserovar variation regarding the internalization ability of Salmonella was observed only in lettuce and green amaranth in a time- and temperature-dependent manner. Attached cells exhibited higher survival rates against low pH than the internalized subpopulation; however, habituation at 20°C in lettuce and amaranth induced acid tolerance to internalized cells, manifested by the 1.5 to 2.0 log CFU/g survivors after 75 min at pH 2.7. Habituation of Salmonella in vegetable extracts sensitized it toward acid, while indigenous microbiota had limited impact on acid resistance of the organism. These findings reveal physiological aspects of Salmonella colonizing leafy vegetables that could be useful in fresh produce microbial risk assessment. IMPORTANCE Consumption of leafy greens has been increasingly associated with foodborne illnesses, and their contamination could occur at pre- and/or postharvest level. Human pathogens may become passively or actively internalized in plant tissues, thereby escaping decontamination procedures. Plant colonization may impact bacterial physiology such as stress resistance and virulence. In this study, it was demonstrated that internalization of Salmonella spp. , at the postharvest level, varied with type of vegetable, serovar, and storage conditions. Attached and internalized subpopulations of Salmonella on/in leafy greens showed distinct physiological responses regarding transcriptional changes of stress- and virulence-associated genes, as well as survival capacity against subsequent exposure to lethal pH (2.7). These findings could contribute to a better understanding and potential (re)definition of the risk of enteric pathogens colonizing leafy greens, as well as to the design of intervention strategies aiming to improve the microbiological safety of fresh produce."

Since the Oklahoma portion of the watershed lies within ten tribal jurisdictions, the potential accumulation of metals within plant species that are gathered and consumed by tribal members, as well as the resulting metal exposure risks to tribal human health, was a warranted concern for further investigation. Within this study, a total of 36 plant species that are commonly consumed by tribes were collected from floodplain areas that were previously demonstrated to have elevated soil metal concentrations relative to reference sites. A significant, positive correlation was shown for metal concentrations in plant tissues versus soil (n = 258; Cd: R = 0.72, p = 0.00; Pb: R = 0.52, p = 0.00; and Zn: R = 0.70, p = 0.00). Additionally, a significant difference in metal concentration distributions existed between reference and impacted plant samples (n = 210, p = 0.00 for all metals). These results proved that floodplain soils are a major contamination pathway for metal accumulation within plants, and the source of metal contamination is the result of mining releases from the TSMD. Metal accumulation within plants was found to vary according to specific metal and plant species. The lowest dietary exposure out of all plant organs sampled were associated with fruit, whereas the highest was associated with roots, stem/leaves, and low-lying leafy greens. Metals in plants were compared to weekly dietary intake limits established by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives. Based on specific serving sizes established within this study for tribal children and adults, many plant species had sufficient concentrations to warrant tribal consumption restrictions within the floodplains of Elm Creek, Grand Lake, Lost Creek, Spring River, and Tar Creek. Importantly, these results highlighted the necessity for the issuance of plant consumption advisories for tribal communities in the watershed. A consumption restriction guide on the number of allowable servings of each species per week at specific streams was developed within this study for tribal children and adults. Results also demonstrated that soil metal concentrations do not need to be exceptionally elevated relative to reference sites in order for plants to accumulate sufficient metal concentrations to exceed dietary limits for one serving. Therefore, the exposure risk associated with the consumption of plants cannot be accurately predicted solely from metal concentrations within soils, but must be based on metal concentrations within specific plant tissues on a site-by-site basis. A weekly consumption scenario was created within this study in order to better understand the potential metal dietary exposures to child and adult tribal members who consume multiple servings of multiple plant species per day, as well as benthic invertebrates and fish from the watershed. These findings demonstrated that plants pose a greater consumption exposure risk for tribal members than benthic invertebrates or fish. Therefore, without the consideration of exposure risks associated with the consumption of plants within future human health risk assessments, tribal health risks will be severely underestimated."
