Over the past three decades, the frequency and global distribution of toxic algal incidents appear to have increased, and human intoxications from novel algal sources have occurred. This increase is of particular concern, since it parallels recent evidence of large-scale ecologic disturbances that coincide with trends in global warming. The extent to which human activities have contributed to their increase therefore comes into question. This review summarizes the origins and health effects of marine algal toxins, as well as changes in their current global distribution, and examines possible causes for the recent increase in their occurrence."

Arcobacter butzleri, Arcobacter cryaerophilus, and Arcobacter skirrowii were detected with an overall prevalence close to 40% and were isolated from 15 (42.8%) fresh cow's milk samples, 12 (73.3%) shellfish samples, 11 (55%) chicken samples, 2 (10%) pork samples, and 1 (5%) beef sample. The results indicate the need to investigate the impact of Arcobacter spp. on public health."

The toxin was found in a meat extract of the mussel, Perna viridis. PSP has not previously been demonstrated in the shellfish of Caribbean islands. The presence of PSP in Trinidad is therefore significant in that it presents an opportunity to better understand the dynamics of PSP and algal blooms in both a region and island environment not normally associated with PSP. P. viridis is not native to Trinidad, but rather originates from eastern Asia. It presented itself only recently in Trinidadian waters. Interestingly, shellfish consumption and algal blooms have had a long history of coexistence in Trinidad without any record of human intoxications. In this context, potential Public Health implications of finding PSP in a non-native shellfish species are briefly discussed."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of hepatitis A virus in molluscs. Standard and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction procedures were used to monitor bivalve molluscs from the Granada fish markets (southern Spain) for this human enteric virus. Between February 2009 and October 2010, we collected a total of 329 samples of different types of bivalve molluscs (mussels, smooth clams, striped venus, and grooved clams). The results showed the presence of hepatitis A virus in 8.5% of the 329 samples analyzed. We can therefore confirm that conventional fecal indicators are unreliable for demonstrating the presence or absence of viruses. The presence of hepatitis A virus in molluscs destined for human consumption is a potential health risk in southern Spain."

In this study, the bioaccessibility of PSTs in the shellfish cooked by different ways was assessed using a static in vitro human digestion model. Results showed that the dissolution of PSTs from shellfish tissues was not significantly affected by digestion time, ratios of solid weight to liquid volume (S/L) and cooking methods, but obviously facilitated by digestive enzymes. Different cooking ways reduced the contents of PSTs in shellfish by 45% to 88%, but did not significantly change the high bioaccessibility of PSTs that ranged from 80% to 95% in four different shellfish matrices. Transformation or degradation of PSTs occurred during the simulated digestion process. This work will help us to objectively assess the potential risks of PSTs to human health."

During May 2010, using recent technologies, a hydrographic dye study was conducted in conjunction with a pathogen bioaccumulation study in shellfish adjacent to a WWTP discharge in Yarmouth, ME. For the first time an improved method of the super-position principle was used to determine the buildup of dye tagged sewage effluent and steady state dilution in tidal waters. Results of the improved method of dilution analysis illustrate an economical, reliable and more accurate and manageable approach for estimating the buildup and steady state pollutant conditions in coastal and estuarine waters."

The most reported MTs include paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), amnesic shellfish toxins (ASTs), diarrheic shellfish toxins (DSTs), cyclic imines (CIs), ciguatoxins (CTXs), azaspiracids (AZTs), palytoxin (PlTXs), tetrodotoxins (TTXs) and their analogs, some of them leading to fatal outcomes. MTs have been reported in several marine organisms causing human poisoning incidents since these organisms constitute the food basis of coastal human populations. In African countries of the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea, to date, only South Africa has a specific monitoring program for MTs and some other countries count only with respect to centers of seafood poisoning control. Therefore, the aim of this review is to evaluate the occurrence of MTs and associated poisoning episodes as a contribution to public health and monitoring programs as an MT risk assessment tool for this geographic region."

The dietary essential fatty acids are linoleic and alpha-linolenic acid. Two omega-3 fatty acids with longer carbon chains, eicosahexaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), can be synthesized in humans from alpha-linolenic precursors. Though not required in the diet per se, EPA and DHA have important roles in metabolism. The almost exclusive source of preformed dietary DHA is fish and shellfish. These foods are also an important source of EPA. In marked contrast to the benefits of fish and shellfish as sources of preformed omega-3 fatty acids, fish and shellfish are almost exclusively the dietary source of methylmercury. Fortunately, these chemicals are not uniformly distributed across many species of fish and shellfish. The purpose of this article is to provide information on the comparative distribution of these chemicals and nutrients to help groups formulating dietary recommendations."

Isaacs Harbour is poised for future industrial development, but before potential impacts are predicted, current marine baseline conditions must be determined. To address this gap, this study established a baseline using surface sediments and biota (mussel and lobster tissues), to provide a broader picture of metal(loid)s in the marine environment. Results confirmed previous studies showing that most sediment metal(loid) concentrations still exceeded Canadian Marine Sediment Quality Guidelines, and also provided evidence of Canadian Food Inspection Agency fish tissue exceedances of arsenic in lobster and lead in mussel tissues indicating that some bioaccumulation of legacy contaminants in marine biota continues to the present day."

The presence of STX was confirmed by LC-mass spectrometry and comparison of fragmentation patterns with an authentic STX standard. LC-FLD quantitation and conversion of the Octopus sp. 5 extracts revealed toxin concentrations as high as 246 microg STX/100g tissue, more than three times the US, European and Australian regulatory limit for human consumption of shellfish of 80 microg STX/100g tissue.

Evaluation of the risks to human health associated with consumption of the bivalves suggested that there is no health risk for moderate shellfish consumers. A regular and continuous biomonitoring program is recommended to establish V. cyprinoides as a bioindicator for assessing the effects of trace metal pollution and to identify future changes to conserve the ""health"" of this fragile ecosystem."

The highest concentrations and similar profiles to those of technical mixtures of HBCDDs were observed in creeks passing through industrial complexes, indicating on-going contamination by high consumption of HBCDDs from industrial activities. γ-HBCDD was dominant in water and sediment, whereas α-HBCDD was dominant in fish and shellfish. The diastereoisomeric profiles of HBCDDs in multiple matrices were influenced by proximity to industry and chemical properties.

The recognized bacterial disease associated with ingestion of contaminated bivalves include typhoid fever (not presently a public health problem), Vibrio parahemolyticus gastroenteritis, and Vibrio chloerae infection. The major known shellfish-associated viral diseases are viral hepatitis and possibly viral gastroenteritis. The ingestion of bivalves that have fed on the toxic species of dinoflagellates that produce red tides may be responsible for an uncommon and very rarely fatal illness, paralytic shellfish poisoning. Outbreaks of airborne respiratory irritation in populations exposed to red tides may be the most common public health problem associated with red tides. The health hazards resulting from industrial, agricultural, and oil pollution of bivalves in coastal waters and the hazard from improper handling of bacterially contaminated mollusks remain to be defined."

Blooms of K. brevis can produce brevetoxins: ladder-shaped polyether (LSP) compounds, which can lead to adverse human health effects, such as reduced respiratory function through inhalation exposure, or neurotoxic shellfish poisoning through consumption of contaminated shellfish. The endogenous role of the brevetoxins remains uncertain. Recent work has shown that some forms of NADPH dependent thioredoxin reductase (NTR) are inhibited by brevetoxin-2 (PbTx-2). The study presented herein reveals that high toxin and low toxin K. brevis, which have a ten-fold difference in toxin content, also show a significant difference in their ability, not only to produce brevetoxin, but also in their cellular redox status and distribution of xanthophyll cycle pigments. These differences are likely due to the inhibition of NTR by brevetoxin. The work could shed light on the physiological role that brevetoxin fills for K. brevis."

Considering different outbreaks described in the literature, the most common route for transmission is accidental contamination after heavy rainfall, when extra loads cause an overflow and release of untreated sewage into the aquatic environment. Outbreak analysis also demonstrates the impact on shellfish consumption of some viral strain transmission and thus their impact on molecular epidemiology, especially for norovirus.

Besides, the both THg and MeHg levels in sediment at mariculture sites were higher (p < 0.05) than corresponding reference sites. It was attributed to the fact that mariculture activities increased Hg loading and promoted MeHg production. The vertical distribution of Hg in sediment cores demonstrated that mercury methylation mostly occurred at the sediment-water interface.

Because the usual thermal processes are not efficient, alternative technologies have to be studied. Here preliminary results are presented about the lability of the DSP toxin okadaic acid in a supercritical atmosphere of carbon dioxide with acetic acid. Most of the toxin is eliminated (up to 90%), and the biological activity against its target enzyme is also severely affected (up to 70% reduction). Detoxification of contaminated shellfish requires a partial dehydration, and the detoxification yield is lower than that obtained with free toxin.

Fourteen PaPs and 9 IDs were detected in the water samples with venlafaxine (59%), benzoylecgonine (40%), EDDP (40%), and citalopram (36%) showing the highest detection frequencies. The highest concentrations were measured for venlafaxine (291 ng L-1), benzoylecgonine (142 ng L-1), lorazepam (95.9 ng L-1), and citalopram (92.5 ng L-1).

Human exposure to PSTs typically occurs through ingestion of recreationally harvested contaminated shellfish and results in nonspecific symptomology. Confirmation of exposure to PSTs has often relied on the measurement of saxitoxin, the most toxic congener; however, gonyautoxins (GTXs), the sulfated carbamate derivatives of saxitoxin, may be present in shellfish at higher concentrations. To improve identification of PST exposures, our group has developed an online solid phase extraction hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography method to identify GTX1-4 in human urine with tandem mass spectrometry. The reportable range varied for each analyte, with all falling within 0.899 and 250 ng/mL in urine with precision <15% and >85% accuracy as determined for all quality control samples. This new online method quantitates GTX1-4 following exposures to PSTs, supporting the work of public health authorities."

In this work, a dual functional cardiomyocyte-based biosensor was proposed to detect DSP and PSP toxins by monitoring the viability and electrophysiology of cardiomyocytes. The results showed that the viability of cardiomyocytes was sensitive to the OA and STX, resulting in significant changes of the electrophysiological properties, including amplitude, firing rate and duration of the extracellular field potential (EFP). The detection limits of the hybrid-biosensor are as low as 7.16 ng/mL for OA and 5.19 ng/mL for STX.

For mammalian and avian receptors, risks posed by theoretical exposures to PCDD/Fs through the food chain were calculated using conservative wildlife exposure models.

WTP effluent did not affect oyster growth or survival, but SPM and oysters acquired wastewater-specific delta 15N per thousand. delta 15N values were depleted near the WTP, typical of low-level processed wastewater. Fecal coliform and MSB concentrations were higher in samples taken closest to the WTP, and MSB values were significantly correlated with delta 15N per thousand in oyster tissues. Overall, oysters demonstrated relatively rapid integration and accumulation of wastewater-specific delta 15N per thousand and indicator microorganisms compared to water samples. These data suggest oysters were superior sentinels compared to water, and MSB was a more reliable indicator of wastewater influence on shellfish than fecal coliforms."

Some of these organisms are important food sources for marine animals and, when ingested, the toxins that they produce may be absorbed and stored in the tissues of the predators, which then become toxic to animals higher up the food chain. This is a particular problem with shellfish, and many cases of poisoning are reported in shellfish consumers each year. At present, there is no practicable means of preventing uptake of the toxins by shellfish or of removing them after harvesting. Assessment of the risk posed by such toxins is therefore required in order to determine levels that are unlikely to cause adverse effects in humans and to permit the establishment of regulatory limits in shellfish for human consumption. In the present review, the basic principles of risk assessment are described, and the progress made toward robust risk assessment of seafood toxins is discussed. While good progress has been made, it is clear that further toxicological studies are required before this goal is fully achieved."

Although stanol fingerprints of contaminated water allowed the identification of the human specific fingerprint, this was not the case for oysters. This discrepancy is attributed to (i) high concentrations of endogenous cholestanol and sitostanol, responsible for ""unbalanced"" stanol fingerprints, (ii) different accumulation/depuration kinetics of fecal coprostanol and 24-ethylcoprostanol and (iii) the limits of the analytical pathway used.

If there is toxicity, it is likely dependent on dose, polymer type, size, surface chemistry, and hydrophobicity. Human activity has led to microplastic contamination throughout the marine environment. As a result of widespread contamination, microplastics are ingested by many species of wildlife including fish and shellfish. Because microplastics are associated with chemicals from manufacturing and that sorb from the surrounding environment, there is concern regarding physical and chemical toxicity. Evidence regarding microplastic toxicity and epidemiology is emerging. We characterize current knowledge and highlight gaps. We also recommend mitigation and adaptation strategies targeting the life cycle of microplastics and recommend future research to assess impacts of microplastics on humans. Addressing these research gaps is a critical priority due to the nutritional importance of seafood consumption."

Studies of Italian cohorts, involving five groups of +/-30 subjects with different seafood consumption habits, and balance studies in Belgian volunteers failed to show a biologically significant absorption of inorganic arsenic either present as such in the food or formed from organoarsenicals during cooking or digestion. The results suggest that the digestion of some seafood, especially mussels, may increase the urinary excretion of the dimethylated arsenic metabolite.

Throughout the monitoring period, occasions of gymnodimine (GYM) and azaspiracid (AZA2) shellfish toxicity were recorded in concentrations that do not endanger human health. The occurrence of yessotoxins (YTXs), the most common toxins found in the Adriatic Sea, was correlated to the presence of the Gonyaulax species, a potential source of YTX. The DSP group of toxins is represented by the ester-OA. Phytoplankton analysis confirmed the presence of dinoflagellates from the Prorocentrum genus, a species associated with DSP toxicity. Occurrence frequency and variability of toxin composition were investigated in conjunction to physico-chemical parameters in the surrounding sea water. In the central Adriatic Sea, the infestation period ranges in general from June to August. However, the depuration phase extended beyond September in the Bay of Neum, increasing the length of the decontamination period."

The amount of plastic in the environment continues to increase, and human exposure to microplastic (MP) has become a reality. This subject has attracted the attention of the whole world. The MP problem has also been noticed by the scientific community. The term microplastic is mostly used to define synthetic material with a high polymer content that can have a size range from 0.1 to 5000 µm. This paper aims to characterize the routes of exposure to MP, define its pollution sources, and identify food types contaminated with plastics. This review addresses the current state of knowledge on this type of particles, with particular emphasis on their influence on human health. Adverse effects of MP depend on routes and sources of exposure. The most common route of exposure is believed to be the gastrointestinal tract. Sources of MP include fish, shellfish, water as well as tea, beer, wine, energy drinks, soft drinks, milk, salt, sugar, honey, poultry meat, fruits, and vegetables. Studies have shown that particles of PET, PE, PP, PS, PVC, PA, and PC are the most frequently found in food."

In terms of spatial distribution, HCB concentrations in air and shellfish showed much variation, which indicated some primary emission sources in China. HCB levels in air and human milk in China were relatively higher than those in other countries, but HCB levels in other compartments were similar to those in Europe and other countries in Eastern Asia. In the limited studies on temporal trends of HCB levels in China, HCB concentrations in air, sediment, fish and human milk did not show a consistent downward trend.

It is the objective of this study to develop a suitable technology for accelerating detoxification of PST from shellfish using activated carbon (AC). The adsorption efficiency of PST by eight different AC materials and by different particle sizes of wood-based AC (WAC) were tested and compared. Then WAC particles (37-48µm) were fed to mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis and scallops Chlamys farreri previously contaminated with PST through feeding with dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense ATHK. Results showed that the maximum adsorption ratio (65%) of PST was obtained by WAC. No significant differences in adsorption ratios were found between different particle sizes of WAC. The toxicity of mussels decreased by 41% and 68% after detoxification with WAC for 1 d and 3 d, respectively. Meanwhile, the detoxification ratio of mussels was approximately 3 times higher than that of scallops. This study suggests that the WAC could be used to accelerate the detoxification of PST by shellfish."

We conducted a scoping review of the scientific literature of studies in all languages published from 2000 through April 2019. We identified 106 RBA of fish and other seafood across Europe, Asia, North America, Africa, and at the global level. Studies were heterogeneous in terms of types of fish and other seafood considered, beneficial and adverse compounds assessed, and overall methodology. Collected data showed that a diet consisting of a variety of lean and fatty fish and other seafood is recommended for the overall population and that women of childbearing age and children should limit the consumption of fish and other seafood types that have a high likelihood of contamination. Our review emphasizes the need for evidence-based, up-to-date, and harmonized approaches in RBA in general."

E. coli levels in bivalves from commercial farms and wild beds were not significantly different but bacterial levels in ascidians were consistently lower. Ascidians exhibited much lower ability than bivalves to accumulate E. coli and MSBs during relaying in a polluted coastal area. This study also shows that an equilibrium was developed between levels of microbes in water and ascidians and shellfish during relaying. E. coli and MSBs in ascidians decreased quickly during depuration in a clean seawater tank.

Three of the objectives of the symposium were to provide a forum to educate key stakeholders on this emerging issue, to identify research and surveillance priorities and to create a DSP network. The purpose of this paper is to review what is known about shellfish poisoning in BC and to describe a novel volunteer network that arose following the symposium. The newly formed network was designed for industry shellfish growers to identify harmful algae bloom events, so that they may take actions to mitigate the effects of harmful blooms on shellfish morbidity. The network will also inform public health and regulatory stakeholders of potentially emerging issues in shellfish growing areas."

Long-term chemical carcinogenesis studies could be easily and feasibly designed using laboratory rodents offered diets containing fish caught in polluted waters. Induced cancers in rodents would corroborate field observations in fish; positive results from these studies would provide further evidence about potential human health hazards from eating substantial amounts of chemically contaminated fish. Nonetheless, fish and aquatic organisms should be viewed as environmental biological monitors of pollution or of potential human health hazards, and authorities responsible for assuring clean and safe rivers, bodies of water, and biota should give more attention to these valid biological indicators or sentinels of environmental pollution. Consequently, fish and other sea creatures alone should serve as alarms regarding whether water areas constitute public health hazards."

Therefore, it is crucial to determine trace STX in seafood samples in order to ensure the safety of seafood consumption. In this study, we developed a novel indirect method for ultrasensitively determining trace STX in seafood by using CE-ICP-MS together with Eu3+ chelate labeling. We demonstrated that diethylenetriamine-N,N,N',N″,N″-pentaacetic acid (DTPA) can couple with STX and simultaneously chelate with Eu3+ to realize metallic labeling of STX, and thus realize the ultrasensitive quantification of trace STX with CE-ICP-MS. The proposed method has strong antiinterference ability, good stability, and extremely high sensitivity. It could be used to determine trace STX in seafood samples with an extremely low detection limit of 0.38 fmol (3.8×10-9 M, 100 nL sample injection) and a relative standard deviation (RSD, n = 5) <7%. The success of this study provides an alternative to precise quantification of ultra-trace STX in seafood samples, and further expands the application of ICP-MS."

Further evidence demonstrated that CA could reduce the histological alterations of the digestive gland of a mussel caused by DSTs.

In this paper we present the first evidence that algal toxins propagate into riparian food webs. We show that MC is present in emerging aquatic insects (Hexagenia mayflies) from the James River Estuary and their consumers (Tetragnathidae spiders and Prothonotary Warblers, Protonotaria citrea). MC levels in Prothonotary Warblers varied by age class, with nestlings having the highest levels. At the site where nestlings received a higher proportion of aquatic prey (i. e. , mayflies) in their diet, we observed higher MC concentrations in liver tissue and fecal matter. Warbler body condition and growth rate were not related to liver MC levels, suggesting that aquatic prey may provide dietary benefits that offset potential deleterious effects of the toxin.

STX-equivalent concentration in the extracts was calibrated by comparison with purified STX, yielding a highly significant correlation (R=0.95; N=30) between electrophysiological determinations and the values obtained by conventional methods. This simple, economical, and reproducible assay obviates the need to sacrifice millions of animals in mandatory paralytic shellfish toxin screening programs."

A total of 116 samples (41 prawn, 44 shellfish, and 31 fishball samples) were collected from major supermarkets and wet markets in Singapore. The mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacterial counts for prawn, shellfish, and fishballs were 2 to 7 log CFU/g. One Salmonella Lexington strain was isolated from a thawed-frozen shellfish product and two Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains were isolated from commercial fishball and shrimp meat products. Thus, seafood sold in Singapore has the potential to be contaminated with Vibrio spp. and Salmonella, and proper handling at food service establishments is required to ensure food safety. Effective control measures also are needed to prevent cross-contamination during postharvest seafood processing."

General linear modelling was used for the analyses. The principle factors affecting the contamination of shellfisheries were season, high/low tidal cycle and rainfall. The effects varied between harvesting areas and between individual sampling points within harvesting areas. Undertaking such analyses for all harvesting areas would contribute to the management of monitoring programmes and assist in the evaluation of potentially contaminating sources, such as sewage discharges.

Consequently, the development of fast, reliable and sensitive detection methods is an evident necessity. The mouse bioassay has been the reference and most commonly used analysis method. However, this technique suffers from low accuracy, specificity and ethical problems due to the animal experimentation. Thus, the development of alternative and efficient detection systems is required. Several biological, chemical, and immunological methods have been developed to evaluate the presence of DSP toxins in seafood. This review gives an overview of different analytical methods and new trends for the detection of OA.

This toxin accumulates in filter feeders and poses threats to human health via shellfish consumption. Consumption of razor clams with high levels of DA and Dungeness crab that prey on them can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning in humans and therefore requires closure of commercial, recreational and subsistence fisheries, postponing or limiting harvesting seasons. These disruptions result in significant losses in revenues along with negative effects to sociocultural dimensions of key importance to coastal communities. Livelihoods and wellbeing of tribal communities are affected disproportionately due to higher vulnerability and reliance on these marine resources for subsistence.

Studies on pork derivatives, shellfish bivalves, and vegetables for HHEV contamination at the sale point need to be extended for evaluating the impact of the agent on food safety, and the meaning of the finding of HHEV genotype 1 genomes in urban sewage from developed countries should be established through active surveillance. Consensus about technical issues in regard to anti-HEV testing would improve the knowledge of the HHEV epidemiology.

The results indicated that there are two different species characteristics of Pb existing in sea food samples. About half of samples were detected to have only Pb(2+), and another half of samples were detected to have both Pb(2+) and trimethyl lead (TML). The results also revealed that Pb species characteristics in the sea foods rather depend on the species of sea food than the sampling area. In comparison with shellfish/shrimp samples, fish samples have higher concentrations of TML and Pb(2+). Especially, the average concentration of TML in the TML-detected fish samples is about 3 times of that in the TML-detected shellfish/shrimp samples, indicating that fish has stronger ability to uptake and accumulate TML. The concentrations of total lead in all samples are lower than the maximum allowable limit of national standard, suggesting that the sea foods collected from Fujian are safe for consumption. By considering that TAL has more toxicity than Pb(2+), the effect of TML in sea foods on the human health should be paid more attention in the future."

In this work, the DA depuration was studied by means of two experiments: one in controlled (laboratory) and another in natural conditions. All organs of A. purpuratus depurated the toxin very quickly in both experiments. In some organs, an increase or a very small decrease of toxin was detected in the early depuration steps. Several models were used to describe this kinetics. The one that included toxin transfer between organs and independent depuration from each organ was the model that best fit the data. It seems, therefore, that the DA in this species is quickly transferred from the digestive gland to all other organs, which release it into the environment.

To this end, we introduce CHROMEVALOAdb, a public database containing the chromatin-associated transcriptome of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (a sentinel model organism) in response to OA exposure. This resource constitutes a leap forward for the development of chromatin-based biomarkers, paving the road towards the generation of powerful and sensitive tests for the detection and evaluation of the genotoxic effects of OA in coastal areas."

The prevention programmes against cancer have obtained satisfactory results except for colorectal cancer (CRC). Identification of risk factors is primordial to plan preventive strategies for CRC. We hypothesize that shellfish consumption is increasing CRC incidence. DSP toxins, present in some seafood products, seem to behave like tumour agents. There are no relevant studies on real health-risk of consuming DSP toxins, just some experimental and ecological evidence. Preventive interventions for reducing CRC risk must be approached through the collaboration of governmental, health and environmental sectors as a single regulatory agency. Sometimes, shellfish accumulates diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins (i. e. okadaic acid and its derivatives) which provoke a gastrointestinal illness (DSP syndrome). Furthermore, DSP toxins are tumour promoters that could increase CRC risk. The current regulation about level of DSP toxins in shellfish meat is only centred on reduction of the gastrointestinal symptoms. Unfortunately, legal levels of DSP toxins in shellfish are enough to increase CRC risk. A review of legislation on DSP toxins is urgent."

However, studies have established that they are inadequate as indicators of the risk of human enteric viruses. Bacteriophages have been identified as potential indicators or surrogates for human enteric viruses due to their similarities in morphology, behaviour in water environments and resistance to disinfectant treatments. The somatic coliphages, male-specific RNA coliphages (FRNA coliphages) and the bacteriophages of Bacteroides are the groups recognised as most suitable for water and shellfish testing. In this review, we discuss the rationale and supporting evidence for the application of bacteriophages as surrogates for human enteric viruses in shellfish under a variety of conditions. There is some evidence to support the validity of using bacteriophage levels to indicate viral risk in shellfish in highly contaminated sites and following adverse sewage events."

Diarrheic shellfish toxins have occurred regularly in Sweden during the past 27 years. Peaks of toxins in mussels are mostly recorded from October to December, but the pattern can differ significantly due to location and year, making it hard to predict toxin levels in mussels. With an expansion of aquaculture and a subsequent increase in seafood consumption, better risk management is needed to minimize the effects on humans of algal toxins and human pathogens. New control strategies that have to be implemented are: i) proper site selection of culture installations; ii) regular and cost-efficient monitoring of algae, bacteria and viruses; iii) new indicators for fecal contamination, suitable for the specific locations where shellfish grow; iv) rapid dissemination of information to the industry and public, including risk assessment and advice on how to cope with the situation."

Therefore, the improvement of post-harvest treatments and practices can represent one of the main strategies to reduce the incidence of viral diseases related to shellfish. This study aimed to investigate long-term relays for the reduction of NoV levels in live oysters, during the high-risk cold months, by transferring the oysters from a more contaminated site to two sites with lower NoV levels. The efficacy of relaying was evaluated by analyzing oyster samples collected at days 0 (T0) and 30 (T30) for NoV levels using a real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The NoV level at the relay sites was consistently lower than at the harvest site. The relay process for 30 days in seawater with a lower NoV level resulted in a decrease in the NoV load compared to day 0 with significant reductions depending on the site and genogroup of NoV considered. These results suggest that long-term relaying of oysters to reduce NoV levels is promising and could help growers to improve oyster safety; however, further investigations are needed."

Results indicated that C. fluminea Formosa accumulated the highest average concentration of total PAHs (43.0 ± 11.3 ng/g wet weight) while M. lusoria contained the lowest concentration (20.0 ± 5.8 ng/g) among all species. The low-molecular-weight PAHs were dominant for both fish and shellfish, which consistent with other studies. Notably, parts of high-molecular-weight PAHs were found in shellfish whereas that was little in fish. The calculated hazard quotients (HQ) of all PAHs were smaller than 1 and the incremental lifetime cancer risks (ILCR) for Benzo[a]pyrene were below 1 × 10-5, suggesting that PAHs in the collected seafood could pose a low hazard to residents. Although the results indicated that the studied seafood is safe for human consumption, children and seniors post relatively higher risks, suggesting that it needs to continue monitoring and control the PAHs concentration in seafood and the associated environments."

Often these limits are set using only acute toxicity data, which is significant, as in some communities, shellfish makes up a large proportion of their daily diet and can be contaminated with paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) for several months. In the current study, feeding protocols were developed to mimic human feeding behaviour and diets containing three dose rates of saxitoxin dihydrochloride (STX.2HCl) were fed to mice for 21 days. This yielded STX.2HCl dose rates of up to 730 µg/kg bw/day with no effects on food consumption, growth, blood pressure, heart rate, motor coordination, grip strength, blood chemistry, haematology, organ weights or tissue histology. Using the 100-fold safety factor to extrapolate from animals to humans yields a dose rate of 7.3 µg/kg bw/day, which is well above the current acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.5 µg STX.2HCl eq/kg bw proposed by the European Food Safety Authority. Furthermore, to reach the dose rate of 7.3 µg/kg bw, a 60 or 70 kg human would have to consume 540 or 630 g of shellfish contaminated with PSTs at the current regulatory limit (800 µg/kg shellfish flesh), respectively. The current regulatory limit for PSTs therefore seems appropriate."

Dietary exposure to high levels of DA via shellfish consumption has been associated with Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning, with milder memory decrements found in Native Americans (NAs) with repetitive, lower level exposures. Despite its importance for protective action, the clinical relevance of these milder memory problems remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether repeated, lower-level exposures to DA impact everyday memory (EM), i. e. , the frequency of memory failures in everyday life. A cross-sectional sample of 60 NA men and women from the Pacific NW was studied with measures of dietary exposure to DA via razor clam (RC) consumption and EM. Findings indicated an association between problems with EM and elevated consumption of RCs with low levels of DA throughout the previous week and past year after controlling for age, sex, and education. NAs who eat a lot of RCs with presumably safe levels of DA are at risk for clinically significant memory problems. Public health outreach to minimize repetitive exposures are now in place and were facilitated by the use of community-based participatory research methods, with active involvement of state regulatory agencies, tribe leaders, and local physicians."

The aim of this work was to determine the occurrence of V. vulnificus in water and seafood samples from a coastal area near the Mediterranean (Valencia, Spain). A TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR assay was optimised and applied to 22 sea water, 42 raw sewage and 40 seafood samples. Results were compared with those obtained for culture isolation. The detection level of the PCR assay was 10 CFU g⁻¹ in inoculated samples. Seven seawater, four shellfish and six wastewater samples were positive by real time PCR. V. vulnificus was isolated from two oyster, three sea water and two wastewater samples. All the strains were obtained after 20 h enrichment, except for wastewater strains, which were isolated directly from the sample. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the isolation of V. vulnificus from sewage in Spain. Our results about the presence of V. vulnificus in food and environmental samples are strong enough to consider that the organism may represent a human health hazard in our geographical area."

Such information is important so that recommendations can be made as to where and when oysters can be cultured such that accumulation of cadmium within these oysters is minimized. Some modern statistical methods are applied to achieve this goal, including monotone spline smoothing, functional principal component analysis, and semi-parametric additive modeling. Oyster growth rates are estimated as the first derivatives of the monotone smoothing growth curves. Some important patterns in cadmium accumulation by oysters are observed. For example, most inland regions tend to have a higher level of cadmium concentration than most coastal regions, so more caution needs to be taken for shellfish aquaculture practices occurring in the inland regions. The semi-parametric additive modeling shows that oyster cadmium concentration decreases with oyster length, and oysters sampled at 7 m have higher average cadmium concentration than those sampled at 1 m."

However, many studies reported that V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus showed multiple-antibiotic resistance due to misuse of antibiotics to control infections in aquaculture production. In addition, both environmental and clinical isolates showed similar antibiotic resistance profiles.

Therefore, our understanding of the risks and benefits of consuming seafood require balanced assessments of contaminants and nutrients found in fish and shellfish. In this paper, we review some of the reported benefits of fish consumption with a focus on the potential hazards of mercury exposure, and compare the environmental variability of fish oils, selenium and mercury in fish.

A request was therefore made by UK food safety authorities to examine these toxins more closely to aid possible management strategies. Of the CI producers only the spirolide producer Alexandrium ostenfeldii is known to exist in UK waters at present but trends in climate change may lead to increased risk from other organisms/CI toxins currently present elsewhere in Europe and in similar environments worldwide.

The spectral data of the DSP toxin-contaminated and non-contaminated Perna viridis samples were acquired in the 950-1700 nm range. To solve the discrimination of spectra with crossover and overlapping, a discriminative non-negative representation-based classifier (DNRC) has been proposed. Compared with collaborative and non-negative representation-based classifiers, the DNRC model exhibited better performance in detecting DSP toxins, with a classification accuracy of 99.44 %. For a relatively small-scale sample dataset in practical applications, the performance of the DNRC model was compared with those of classical models. The DNRC model achieved the best results for both identification accuracy and F-measure, and its detection performance did not significantly decrease with decreasing sample size.

PSP typically occurs through the ingestion of bivalve shellfish that have consumed toxin producing dinoflagellates. Due to initial presentation of symptoms being nonspecific, a clinical measurement is needed to confirm exposure to these toxins. Our group has developed an online solid phase extraction hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) method for the analysis of STX and NEO in human urine with tandem mass spectrometry. A unique feature of this online method is the incorporation of a new synthetic (15)N4-STX labeled internal standard used for quantitation. Manual sample preparation time was reduced by approximately 70% for 98 urine samples as compared to a previously reported method. The lowest reportable limit for STX was improved from 5.0 ng/mL to 1.01 ng/mL and from 10.0 ng/mL to 2.62 ng/mL for NEO. Three analysts validated the method with 20 calibration curves total over 30 days with precision and accuracy within ±15% for all QCs. This new online method rapidly identifies STX and NEO exposure with improved sensitivity, which can facilitate the work of public health authorities to confirm the cases of PSP, complementing the many shellfish monitoring programs worldwide."

However, tumorigenic and embryotoxic effects of OA have been also described. Current toxicokinetic studies with mice were performed with high cytotoxic oral doses leading presumably to a paracellular passage of OA through the gastrointestinal barrier. There are no studies available analyzing the absorption at low concentrations, which represent a realistic dietary exposure, making a reliable risk assessment difficult. Therefore, we performed a low-dose study using the human intestinal Caco-2 cell model to simulate the intestinal barrier. Low level exposure of 20-200 nM OA to the cell monolayer allows an only limited passage from the ""luminal"" to the ""blood side"". Furthermore, we could detect a significant efflux of OA, which led to the suggestion that active transport mechanisms are involved in the elimination process of OA.

Aim of this work was to improve knowledge about the repeatability of OA accumulation phenomena in various seasons trying to understand whether or not there was a trend. Also, the interaction between toxic algae and OA accumulation was examined. In this study, data of lipophilic toxins, water temperature and abundance of DSP-producing microalgal species were collected in a four-year period (2015-2018) in coastal production areas of Sardinia. Several episodes of OA positive values (>160 eq μgAO/Kg pe, Reg 853/04) were recorded during the study period in different production areas of Sardinia and in different seasons. A seasonal repeatability of OA accumulation in molluscs was observed in some production areas; moreover, different temporal gaps between the presence of toxic algae and OA accumulation were reported. Toxicity was observed almost exclusively in Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamark (99%), being this matrix the most abundant species bred in Sardinia."

The concentrations of Zn and Cu were much higher than those of Cd, Cr, and Pb in all the organisms. In general, the heavy metal concentration levels were in the order phytoplankton < zooplankton < fish < shrimp < shellfish. Heavy metal concentrations in higher trophic-level aquatic organisms in Bohai Bay were compared to those in the organisms from other worldwide coastal waters. The concentration levels of most heavy metals were higher than the 75th percentile, except that Pb concentration was between the 25th and 50th percentiles. The calculated bioconcentration factors (BCF) of Cr, Cu, and Pb for phytoplankton were less than 100, indicating no accumulation in primary producers. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) of Pb for zooplankton was the highest, indicating significant Pb accumulation in zooplankton. For higher trophic-level aquatic organisms, the order of BAF values was fish < shrimp < shellfish for most metals except for Pb. The human health risk assessment suggests that strict abatement measures of heavy metals must be taken to decrease the health risk caused by consuming aquatic products."

The nature and extent of such faecal contamination from boats in marinas of different design and use is still inadequately understood. In this study the levels of faecal coliform (FC) bacteria were measured in the waters of a confined and an open water marina over a 6 d period encompassing a holiday weekend. Levels of FC rose with increasing occupancy by boats and boaters during the study period and then declined again. FC levels were higher in waters of a confined or basin marina than in waters of an open or unconfined marina. In both confined and open water marinas, FC levels were highest in water samples collected near boats but they also became elevated on occasion in water samples taken a distance of 305 m from boats. Concentrations of FC in marina waters exceeded the standards and guidelines for shell-fishing and primary contact recreation waters. Therefore, greater consideration of human health risks from enteric microbes in marina waters and shellfish is recommended."

Along the West coast of North America, Mytilus californianus (California sea mussel) has long been used as the primary indicator species for monitoring levels of PSPT in the environment. However, because the natural distribution of this species is limited to rocky shores, vast stretches of coastline bordered by sandy beach habitat are not regularly monitored for PSPT presence. This insufficient spatial coverage greatly reduces the ability to track and predict HAB development and movement along the open coast. Earlier studies on Emerita analoga (common mole or sand crab) demonstrated this species' potential to sequester the neurotoxin saxitoxin (STX) and its derivatives. The goals of this study were to (1) develop a practical and efficient PSPT extraction protocol for sand crabs, and (2) compare the utility and reliability of this species as an indicator of PSPT with that of mussels. Laboratory spike and recovery results showed that STX extraction efficiencies were very similar for both species. Field comparisons of natural accumulation and depuration rates of PSPT for the two species revealed that PSPT events detected using mussels were also identified with sand crabs."

Substantial differences in the AZP toxin levels between tissue compartments were observed and toxins were concentrated predominantly, about 85%, in the hepatopancreas. There was also a significant variation in the total toxin levels between individual scallops from the same sample batch and the RSD was 60% (n = 9).

The present study investigated the distribution and potential impact of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in the Caroni Swamp, Trinidad and Tobago's largest mangrove ecosystem. Surface sediments and mangrove oysters (Crassostrea rhizophorae) from 10 sites in the swamp were analysed for the 6 identified metals. The concentration ranges (in μg/g dry wt. ) of metals in sediments from Caroni Swamp were: Zn (113.4-264.6), Cr (27-69.7), Ni (10.7-41.1) and Cu (11-40.7). Based on Canadian Sediment Quality Guidelines (CSQGs), metals in sediments posed a low to medium risk to aquatic life. The concentration ranges (in μg/g wet wt. ) for metals in Crassostrea rhizophorae tissues were: Zn (123.2-660), Cu (4.2-12.3), Ni (0.1-5.5), Pb (0.1-0.9), Cr (0.2-0.3) and Cd (0.1-0.2). Multiple evaluations indicated that zinc posed a potential threat to the health of oyster consumers. Information from this study is vital for managing the Caroni Swamp, safeguarding the health of consumers of shellfish on this Caribbean island and serving as a useful baseline for future local and regional risk assessments."

Acute toxicity of the elutriate was evaluated in five species of three trophic levels (Isochrysis galbana, Paracentrotus lividus, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Venerupis pullastra and Siriella armata). The sediments of the pillars showed moderate levels of contamination by trace elements (Cu, Cr). Clam and sea urchin embryo-larval toxicity tests showed slightly higher sensitivity than mussel embryo tests, and toxicity was not detected for phytoplankton and mysid bioassays. The predicted no-effect environmental concentration (PNEC) was calculated from the arithmetic mean of the lowest calculated EC(50)s for each sampling site. The predicted environmental concentration (PEC) was estimated from a simple dilution model and the PEC/PNEC ratio was calculated according to different scenarios of resuspension.

We fitted a bivariate hidden Markov Model (HMM) incorporating an autoregressive correlation among the observed DST measurements to account for environmental persistence of DST. We then reconstruct the maximum-likelihood profile of algae presence in the water column at daily intervals using the Viterbi algorithm. Using historical monitoring data from Andalucía, the model estimated that potentially toxigenic Dinophysis algae is present at greater than or equal to 250 cells/L between < 1% and >10% of the year depending on the site and year. The historical time-series reconstruction enabled by this method may facilitate future investigations into temporal dynamics of toxigenic Dinophysis blooms."

The quantitative capabilities of LAESI-MS/MS for DA analysis from mussel tissue were evaluated by analysis of four mussel tissue reference materials using matrix-matched calibration. Linear response was observed from 1 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg and the method limit of detection was 1 mg/kg. Results for DA analysis in tissue within the linear range were in good agreement with two established methods, LC-UV and LC-MS/MS (recoveries from 103 to 125%). Beyond the linear range, extraction and clean-up were required to achieve good quantitation. Most notable is the extremely rapid analysis time of about 10 s per sample by LAESI-MS/MS, which corresponds to a significant increase in sample throughput compared with existing methodology for routine DA analysis."

The potential of cyanobacteria to produce toxins has been linked to the presence of specific biosynthetic gene clusters. Here, we describe the application of a robotic PCR-based assay for the semi-automated and simultaneous detection of toxin biosynthesis genes of each of the toxin classes characterized to date for cyanobacteria [i. e. , microcystins (MCYs), nodularins (NODs), cylindrospermopsins (CYNs) and paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs)/saxitoxins (SXTs)]. We demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for each assay using well-characterized, cultured isolates, and establish its utility as a quantitative PCR using DNA, clone and cell-based dilution series. In addition, we used 206 field-collected samples and 100 known negative controls to compare the performance of each assay with conventional PCR and direct toxin detection. We report a diagnostic specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of ≥97.7% for each assay."

The model yielded a general equation, which can predict the viral load at any depuration time knowing the specific filtration rate, dependent on the bivalve species, and specific viral properties.

Although shellfish are at particular risk of dietary exposure to DA, there have been no systematic DA risk assessments in Chinese coastal waters. A total of 451 shellfish samples were collected from March to November 2020. The presence of DA and four of its isomers were detected using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The spatial-temporal distribution of DA occurrence and its potential health risks were examined. DA was detected in 198 shellfish samples (43.90%), with a maximum level of 942.86 μg/kg. DA was recorded in all 14 shellfish species tested and Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) showed the highest average DA concentration (82.36 μg/kg). The DA concentrations in shellfish showed distinct spatial-temporal variations, with significantly higher levels of occurrence in autumn than in summer and spring (p < 0.01), and particularly high occurrence in Guangdong and Fujian Provinces. The detection rates and maximum concentrations of the four DA isomers were low. While C. gigas from Guangdong Province in September showed the highest levels of DA contamination, the risk to human consumers was low. This study improves our understanding of the potential risk of shellfish exposure to DA-residues."

Investigations of the presence and abundance of PST-producing microalgal species in marine water and of the toxins associated with shellfish were carried out concomitantly. Overall, the results suggested a spatio-temporal expansion of Alexandriumpacificum and Alexandriumminutum in recent years, with an increasing number of PSTs present in molluscs and increased occurrences of toxicity cases. Liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection determined the toxin profile to be composed primarily of the carbamate gonyautoxin-5 and N-sulphocarbamoyltoxins 1 and 2. The study highlights the potential high risk to consumers of poisoning by bivalve molluscs bred in Sardinia, where shellfish production is a very important industrial sector.

These facts underlie difficulties in determining cause and effect relationships between hepatitis A outbreaks and detection of HAV contamination in shellfish samples. We have developed a reliable and highly sensitive method for detection of HAV in oyster tissues at low levels (0.001 FFU/ml-fluorescent focus units per milliliter). Our method combines dissection of the gastrointestinal oyster tract, organic extraction before PEG precipitation, and RNA extraction with Trizol LS, followed by RT-PCR and hybridization using a digoxigenin-labeled HAV cDNA probe.

Analyses were performed by high performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Stable isotope ratios for nitrogen and carbon were also measured in the samples for obtaining trophic level information of the species. Arsenic-containing hydrocarbons (AsHCs) and arsenic-containing fatty acids (AsFAs) were detected in the seafood samples; the toxic AsHCs were found in all of the seafood samples with large variation in the concentrations (83 ± 73 ng As/g fw, coefficient of variation = 88%). Our previous point estimate of health risk of AsHCs intake via seafood consumption in Japan, based on average AsHC concentration in seafood, suggested insignificant risk, and the present study supports our previous estimate. AsHC concentrations significantly correlated with lipid content of the seafood samples (r = 0.67, p < 0.01), a result expected because of the fat solubility of the compounds. The AsHCs concentrations, however, were not significantly correlated with nitrogen stable isotope ratios suggesting that AsHCs do not biomagnify. The source of the observed large variation in AsHC concentrations will be the subject of further investigation."

Food safety authorities from several countries have regulated the content of DSPs and YTXs in shellfish to protect human health. In mice, OA and YTX have been associated with ultrastructural heart damage in vivo. Therefore, this study explored the potential of OA, DTX-1 and YTX to cause acute heart toxicity. Cardiotoxicity was evaluated in vitro by measuring hERG (human èter-a-go-go gene) channel activity and in vivo using electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings and cardiac damage biomarkers. The results demonstrated that these toxins do not exert acute effects on hERG channel activity. Additionally, in vivo experiments showed that these compounds do not alter cardiac biomarkers and ECG in rats acutely. Despite the ultrastructural damage to the heart reported for these toxins, no acute alterations of heart function have been detected in vivo, suggesting a functional compensation in the short term."

The official control method of DSP toxins in seafood is the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS). However in order to calculate the total toxicity of shellfish, the concentration of each compound must be multiplied by individual Toxicity Equivalency Factor (TEF). Considering that TEFs caused some controversy and the scarce information about DTX2 toxicity, the aim of this study was to characterize the oral toxicity of DTX2 in mice. A 4-Level Up and Down Procedure allowed the characterization of DTX2 effects and the estimation of DTX2 oral TEF based on determination of the lethal dose 50 (LD50). DTX2 passed the gastrointestinal barrier and was detected in urine and feces. Acute toxicity symptoms include diarrhea and motionless, however anatomopathology study and ultrastructural images restricted the toxin effects to the gastrointestinal tract. Nevertheless enterocytes microvilli and tight junctions were not altered, disconnecting DTX2 diarrheic effects from paracellular epithelial permeability. This is the first report of DTX2 oral LD50 (2262 μg/kg BW) indicating that its TEF is about 0.4.

Dictionary: {}</s>",{'Mussels': ['GB124']}</s>,"This study set out to determine whether phage-based indicators may provide a 'low-tech' alternative to existing approaches that might help maintain the microbial safety of shellfish and their overlying waters. Mussels and their overlying waters were collected biweekly from an estuary in southeast England over a 2-year period (May 2013-April 2015) (n = 48). Levels of bacterial indicators were determined using membrane filtration and most probable number methods and those of bacteriophages were determined by direct plaque assay. The detection of adenovirus was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results revealed that somatic coliphages demonstrated the most significant correlations with AdV F and G in mussels (ρ = 0·55) and overlying waters (ρ = 0·66), followed by GB124 phages (ρ = 0·43) while Escherichia coli showed no correlation with AdV F and G in mussels. This study demonstrates that the use of somatic coliphages and GB124 phages may provide a better indication of the risk of adenovirus contamination of mussels and their overlying waters than existing bacterial indicators. Phage-based detection may be particularly advantageous in low-resource settings where viral infectious disease presents a significant burden to human health."

Arsenic speciation analysis indicated that high concentrations of arsenolipids were detected in lower trophic organisms. The maximum level of organoarsenic in seafood should be evaluated because of the potential toxicity of arsenolipids and arsenosugar metabolites. Weekly intake of metal(loid)s was far below the recommended provisional tolerable weekly intake even with excessive consumption of aquatic products.

In this work, RISEGAL applied a systematic approach for the identification of emerging food safety risks potentially affecting bivalve shellfish. First, a comprehensive review of scientific databases was carried out to identify hazards most quoted as emerging in bivalves in the period 2016-2018. Then, identified hazards were semiquantitatively assessed by a panel of food safety experts, who scored them accordingly with the five evaluation criteria proposed by EFSA: novelty, soundness, imminence, scale, and severity. Scores determined that perfluorinated compounds, antimicrobial resistance, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, hepatitis E virus (HEV), and antimicrobial residues are the emerging hazards that are considered most imminent and severe and that could cause safety problems of the highest scale in the bivalve value chain by the majority of the experts consulted (75%).

In this context, the present study was intended to project the potential biogeographical changes in habitat suitability and occurrence distribution of three key amnesic shellfish toxin (AST)-producing diatom species (i. e. , Pseudo-nitzschia australis, P. seriata, and P. fraudulenta) under four different climate change scenarios (i. e. , RCP-2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) up to 2050 and 2100. For this purpose, we applied species distribution models (SDMs) using four abiotic predictors (i. e. , sea surface temperature, salinity, current velocity, and bathymetry) in a MaxEnt framework. Overall, considerable contraction and potential extirpation were projected for all species at lower latitudes together with projected poleward expansions into higher latitudes, mainly in the northern hemisphere.

While significant PST accumulation in the lobster hepatopancreas has been reported in parallel experiments feeding lobsters with toxic mussels, no PST toxin accumulated in this experiment from exposure to toxic algal cells, and no negative impact on lobster health was observed as assessed via a wide range of behavioural, immunological, and physiological measures.

Structural studies indicated that these toxins, azaspiracids, were of a new unprecedented class containing novel structural features. It is now known that the prevalent azaspiracids in mussels are AZA1, AZA2 and AZA3, which differ from each other in their degree of methylation. Several hydroxylated and carboxylated analogues of the main azaspiracids have also been identified, presumed to be metabolites of the main toxins. Since its first discovery in Irish mussels, the development of facile sensitive and selective LC-MS/MS methods has resulted in the discovery of AZA in other countries and in other species. Mice studies indicate that this toxin class can cause serious tissue injury, especially to the small intestine, and chronic exposure may increase the likelihood of the development of lung tumours. Studies also show that tissue recovery is very slow following exposure. These observations suggest that AZA is more dangerous than the other known classes of shellfish toxins. Consequently, in order to protect human consumers, proper risk assessment and regulatory control of shellfish and other affected species is of the utmost importance."

We estimated Cd concentrations in human urine and blood via daily intake from seafood consumption and inhalation based on a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. A Hill-based dose-response model was used to assess human renal dysfunction and peripheral arterial disease risks for long-term Cd exposure.

Our results indicated that glomerular and tubular damage among different genders and smokers ranged from 18.03 to 18.18%.

The weekly bulletin characterizes the current shellfish closure situation and next week's forecasts for potentially impacted areas. The period analyzed ranged from 27 July 2013 to 17 March 2014, and describes the first skill assessment of the warning system. The forecast accuracy was evaluated, considering the number of forecasts that were verified to be correct the following week (85%) as well as the number of events not forecasted (false negatives, 12%) and those expected but did not occur (false positives, 3%). Variations were most visible in the first weeks of bulletin implementation and during autumn-winter months.

The methodology developed was validated in-house and used to analyse UK 2004 Total Diet Study (TDS) samples and shellfish (oysters, mussels and scallops) collected from Scotland. HBCD was detected in most samples; in both studies the alphaHBCD diastereoisomer was generally the most abundant as opposed to the gamma diastereoisomer that tends to dominate in environmental samples and manufactured products. It is reported that selective metabolism or biotransformation of the beta and gamma diastereoisomers may be taking place. TBBPA was not detected in any samples above the limit of detection, which was as low as 0.05 microg kg(-1). This may be because TBBPA, unlike HBCD, is chemically bound to the polymer matrix during manufacture and not readily leached. The UK Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) concluded that the concentrations of HBCD and TBBPA detected in the TDS study did not raise toxicological concerns and, as levels in the shellfish samples were in a similar concentration range, it was concluded that exposure to the BFRs measured is not significant when compared to exposure from the rest of the diet."

Epifaunal (Crassostrea virginica) and infaunal (Mercenaria mercenaria) shellfish, placed on or in cores, were exposed to either resuspended or undisturbed sediments containing bound poliovirus type 1 (LSc 2ab). Consistent bioaccumulation by oysters (four of five trials) was only noted when sediment-bound viruses occurred in the water column. Virus accumulation was observed in a single instance where sediments remained in an undisturbed state. While the incidence of bioaccumulation was higher with resuspended rather than undisturbed contaminated sediment, the actual concentration of accumulated viruses was not significantly different. The accumulation of viruses from oysters residing on uninoculated sediments. When clams were exposed to undisturbed, virus-contaminated sediments, two of five shellfish pools yielded viral isolates. Bioaccumulation of undisturbed sediments by these bivalves was considered marginal when related to the concentration of virus in contaminated sediments; they would only represent a significant threat when suspended in the water column. Arguments were advanced for water-column sampling in the region of the water-sediment interface to provide an accurate determination of the virological quality of shellfish harvesting waters."

Herein, the latest research progresses of aptasensors towards shellfish toxins in the marine food chain in the past five years was reviewed for the first time, in terms of the aptamers applied in these aptasensors, construction principles, signal transduction techniques, response types, individual performance properties, practical applications, and advantages/disadvantages of these aptasensors.

The results showed that for mean exposure levels, the THQ values in four aquatic products were all below one, meaning that there was no non-carcinogenic risk. For high exposure levels, the hazard index (HI) value exceeded one in fish in North China, which means the potential non-carcinogenic risk should not be ignored. As for cadmium, most of the TR values in crab and shellfish exceed 1 × 10-4 in North China, East China, and South China.

We simulated water contamination after a point-source release from a combined sewer overflow (CSO) where untreated wastewater is released directly into the coastal zone. All three microbiological indicators accumulated rapidly in the mussels, reaching close to maximum concentration within 3 h of exposure, demonstrating that short CSO discharges pose an immediate threat to shellfish harvesting areas. Depuration (72 h) in clean water proved partially successful at removing both pathogenic and non-pathogenic E. coli from shellfish tissue, but failed to eradicate NoV GII RNA.

Outbreaks of DSP have been increasing and are of worldwide public health concern; therefore, there is a growing demand for more rapid, reliable, and economical analytical methods for the detection of this toxin. In this study, anti-okadaic acid single-chain variable fragment (scFv) genes were prepared by cloning heavy and light chain genes from hybridoma cells, followed by fusion of the chains via a linker peptide. An scFv-pLIP6/GN recombinant plasmid was constructed and transformed into Escherichia coli for expression, and the target scFv was identified with IC-CLEIA (chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay). The IC15 was 0.012 ± 0.02 μg/L, and the IC50 was 0.25 ± 0.03 μg/L. The three-dimensional structure of the scFv was simulated with computer modeling, and okadaic acid was docked to the scFv model to obtain a putative structure of the binding complex. Two predicted critical amino acids, Ser32 and Thr187, were then mutated to verify this theoretical model. Both mutants exhibited significant loss of binding activity. These results help us to understand this specific scFv-antigen binding mechanism and provide guidance for affinity maturation of the antibody in vitro.

Our results showed that the region of study is impacted by a continuous discharge of domestic sewage. Although E. coli was detected at low densities in water samples, mussels were shown to be 400 times more contaminated throughout the period of the study. Adenovirus and rotavirus genomes were detected by nested-polymerase chain reaction respectively in 76 and 88% of water samples and 100% of mussel samples. Norovirus was found in 4.8% of water samples and was not detected in the mussels. The screening of bivalves for the presence of health-significant enteric viruses can help in the prevention of outbreaks among shellfish consumers and contribute to improvement of the estuarine environment."

It is urgent to exploit new detection methods with high specificity and high efficiency. Here, a portable high-throughput cardiomyocyte-based potential biosensor was established with cardiomyocytes, a 16-well microelectrodes (MEs) sensor and a robust 32-channel recording system, which presented high-quality and high-consistency extracellular field potential (EFP) signals in each well with a long duration of 80 h. The feature parameters, including firing rate (FR), spike amplitude (SA), spike slope (SS), spike duration (SD) and field potential duration (FPD), were extracted from EFP to quantitatively assess the toxic effects of these ion channel toxins. Importantly, the biosensor showed temporal specificity and parametric selectivity under toxin treatments, and FR, SS and SD were the optimal parameters to STX, TTX and GTX-2, respectively. This biosensor can rapidly detect 0.29 ng/mL STX, 0.30 ng/mL TTX and 0.16 ng/mL GTX-2 within 5 min, 10 min and 15 min, respectively.

Comparative metabolite profiles of OA after incubation in rat and human recombinant CYP enzymes were established by using LC-MS/MS technique. Results demonstrated that metabolism of OA to oxygenated metabolites correlates with detoxification which was mainly catalyzed by human CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Detoxification by rat Cyp3a1 was lower compared to human CYP3A enzymes and activation of OA by Cyp3a2 was observed, coincident with minor overall conversion capacity of OA. By contrast human and rat CYP1A2 seem to activate OA into cytotoxic intermediates. In conclusion, different mechanisms of OA metabolism may occur in the liver. At low OA doses, the human liver is likely well protected against cytotoxic OA, but for high shellfish consumers a potential risk cannot be excluded."

In addition to these microalgal sources, saxitoxin and related compounds, referred to in this review as STXs, are also produced in freshwater cyanobacteria and have been associated with calcareous red macroalgae. STXs are transferred and bioaccumulate throughout aquatic food webs, and can be vectored to terrestrial biota, including humans. Fisheries closures and human intoxications due to STXs have been documented in several non-traditional (i. e. non-filter-feeding) vectors. These include, but are not limited to, marine gastropods, both carnivorous and grazing, crustacea, and fish that acquire STXs through toxin transfer. Often due to spatial, temporal, or a species disconnection from the primary source of STXs (bloom forming dinoflagellates), monitoring and management of such non-traditional PSP vectors has been challenging. A brief literature review is provided for filter feeding (traditional) and non-filter feeding (non-traditional) vectors of STXs with specific reference to human effects. We include several case studies pertaining to management actions to prevent PSP, as well as food poisoning incidents from STX(s) accumulation in non-traditional PSP vectors."

Filter-feeding shellfish concentrate bacteria from the environment and thus can also harbor extended-spectrum β-lactamase—producing Escherichia coli (ESBL E. coli) as an example of a resistant pathogen of concern. Is the short steaming procedure that blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) undergo before consumption enough for food safety in regard to such resistant pathogens? In this study, we performed experiments to assess the survival of ESBL E. coli in blue mussel. Consequently, a predictive model for the dose of ESBL E. coli that consumers would be exposed to, after preparing blue mussels or similar through the common practice of brief steaming until opening of the shells, was performed. The output of the model is the expected number of colony forming units per gram (cfu/g) of ESBL E. coli in a meal as a function of the duration and the temperature of steaming and the initial contamination. In these experiments, the heat tolerance of the ESBL-producing E. coli strain was indistinguishable from that of non-ESBL E. coli, and the heat treatments often practiced are likely to be insufficient to avoid exposure to viable ESBL E. coli. Steaming time (>3.5−4.0 min) is a better indicator than shell openness to avoid exposure to these ESBL or indicator E. coli strains."

HABs represent one of the most important sources of contamination in marine environments, as well as a serious threat to public health, fisheries, aquaculture-based industries, and tourism.

Marine dinoflagellates of the genera Dinophysis and Prorocentrum are representative producers of okadaic acid (OA) and dinophysistoxins responsible for the diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) which is a human intoxication caused by the consumption of shellfish that bioaccumulate those toxins. In this work we explore the use of natural clay for removing Prorocentrum lima. We evaluate the adsorption properties of clays in seawater containing the dinoflagellates. The experimental results confirmed the cell removal through the flocculation of algal and mineral particles leading to the formation of aggregates, which rapidly settle and further entrain cells during their descent. Moreover, the microscopy images of the samples enable one to observe the clays in aggregates of two or more cells where the mineral particles were bound to the outer membranes of the dinoflagellates. Therefore, this preliminary data offers promising results to use these clays for the mitigation of HABs."

The influence of dietary and water consumption on serum PFAA levels was also evaluated.

Most PFAA concentrations except for PFOA were detected in higher concentrations among males, and were positively correlated with age and body mass index (BMI). PFOA concentrations were relatively higher among the female of childbearing age, e. g. , 20-49years old, raising concerns on potential impacts on fetus through transplacental transfer or lactation. In addition, the concentrations of PFOA in Daegu population were higher than other areas of Korea, suggesting a presence of distinctive sources in the area.

This suggests that factors other than the simple presence or absence of virus RNA are important contributors to the amount of illness reported. This study compares norovirus RNA levels in oyster samples strongly linked to norovirus or norovirus-type illness with the levels typically found in commercial production areas (non-outbreak-related samples). A statistically significant difference between norovirus levels in the two sets of samples was observed. The geometric mean of the levels in outbreak samples (1,048 copies per g) was almost one order of magnitude higher than for positive non-outbreak-related samples (121 copies per g). Further, while none of the outbreak-related samples contained fewer than 152 copies per g, the majority of positive results for non-outbreak-related samples was below this level.

To test these hypotheses, short-term grazing experiments were conducted with several diatoms, including the domoic acid (DA)-producing Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries (1.31+/-0.057 pg DA cell(-1)) and the non-toxic Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima, Thalassiosira weissflogii, and Ditylum brightwellii.

Thus, monitoring programs for shellfish quality along the entire food chain could help to finally preserve the health of consumers. The aim of the present study was to provide up-to-date data on the prevalence of enteric virus contamination along the shellfish production and distribution chain in Sicily. To this end, 162 batches of mollusks were collected between 2017 and 2019 from harvesting areas, depuration and dispatch centers (n = 63), restaurants (n = 6) and retail stores (n = 93) distributed all over the island. Samples were processed according to ISO 15216 standard method, and the presence of genogroup GI and GII norovirus (NoV), hepatitis A and E viruses (HAV, HEV), rotavirus and adenovirus was investigated by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time-RT PCR), nested (RT)-PCR and molecular genotyping. Our findings show that 5.56% of samples were contaminated with at least one NoV, HAV and/or HEV. Contaminated shellfish were sampled at production sites and retail stores and their origin was traced back to Spain and several municipalities in Italy. In conclusion, our study highlights the need to implement routine monitoring programs along the whole food chain as an effective measure to prevent foodborne transmission of enteric viruses."

However, little is known regarding the effects of the toxins produced by blooming dinoflagellates on C. edule. Herein, we explore the Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) of two tissues (gills and digestive gland) from wild cockles sampled in Portugal, through their whole transcriptomic response in two different seasons (exposed and not exposed to DSTs). The de novo transcriptome assembly returned 684,723 contigs, N50 of 1049, and 98.53% completeness. Altogether, 1098 DEGs were identified, of which 353 DEGs were exclusive for the digestive gland, 536 unique for the gills and 209 DEGs were common. Among DEGs were identified known DSTs-biomarkers including glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, cytochrome P450, ABC transporters, actin and tubulin-related proteins, Heat shock proteins and complement C1Q-like proteins. This study provides the first transcriptomic profile of C. edule, giving new insights about its molecular responses under different environmental conditions of DSTs exposure."

The aim of this paper is to establish the relative intraperitoneal toxicity of dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX-2) compared with okadaic acid (OA). The study was performed as an open, randomised parallel group trial with a four level response surface design within each of the two parallels. In accordance with the response surface design model, the LD50 for DTX-2 and OA was 338 and 206 microg/kg, respectively. By use of common regression analysis, the LD50 of DTX-2 and OA were estimated to 352 microg/kg and 204 microg/kg, respectively. The deviations between the LD50 estimates by the two methods was 4% for DTX-2 and less than 1% for OA. Taken together, these results indicate that the relative toxicity of DTX-2 is about 0.6, compared to OA. Results from the PP2A assay correspond very well with the results obtained by the mouse bioassay. The IC50 concentrations for DTX-2 and OA were 5.94 and 2.81 ng/mL, respectively. This indicates that OA is about twice as toxic as DTX-2. Since inhibition of PP2A is acknowledged as the main mechanism of toxicity of the OA group toxins, this supports the establishment of a relative toxicity factor of DTX-2 of 0.6 compared with OA."

The first identification of azaspiracids in other bivalve mollusks including oysters (Crassostrea gigas), scallops (Pecten maximus), clams (Tapes phillipinarium), and cockles (Cardium edule) is reported.

We also examined how mild exercise affected the reported symptoms and spirometry tests during unexposed and exposed periods with a subgroup of the same lifeguards. Environmental sampling (K. brevis cell concentrations in seawater and brevetoxin concentrations in seawater and air) was used to confirm unexposed/exposed status.

Significant negative correlation was observed between metal bioaccessibility and metal concentration in the oysters for Ag, Cd, and Cu. We found that the oral bioaccessibility of the five metals was positively correlated with their trophically available metal fraction (TAM) in the oyster tissues, and negatively correlated with metal distribution in the cellular debris. Thus, metal partitioning in the TAM and cellular debris controlled the oral bioaccessibility to humans.

In the present study, we investigated the oral bioaccessibility of five toxic metals (Ag, Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn) in contaminated oysters collected from different locations of a large estuary in southern China. In all oysters, total Zn concentration was the highest whereas total Pb concentration was the lowest. Among the five metals, Ag had the lowest oral bioaccessibility (38.9-60.8%), whereas Cu and Zn had the highest bioaccessibility (72.3-93.1%). Significant negative correlation was observed between metal bioaccessibility and metal concentration in the oysters for Ag, Cd, and Cu. We found that the oral bioaccessibility of the five metals was positively correlated with their trophically available metal fraction (TAM) in the oyster tissues, and negatively correlated with metal distribution in the cellular debris. Thus, metal partitioning in the TAM and cellular debris controlled the oral bioaccessibility to humans. Given the dependence of oral bioaccessibility on tissue metal contamination, bioaccessibility needs to be incorporated in the risk assessments of contaminated shellfish."

These groups, which may consume 10 times more fish and seafood than average US consumers, have special dietary practices that can lead to significant exposures to persistent pollutants and biotoxins found in fish and shellfish. The mechanism of toxicity of these contaminants is also important. Using the example of dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), different risk assessment approaches are presented and the analytical sensitivity needed to assess risk for different consumption groups is evaluated quantitatively. Our studies have also shown that regulatory agencies evaluation of fish consumption for average US populations do not always adequately consider unique consumption and cooking practices of these groups. Partnering with communities is important for appropriate exposure and risk assessments. This also empowers proactive action by communities to evaluate the risks and many benefits of fish and shellfish consumption and develop risk management strategies tailored for their communities."

For this reason, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was requested by the European Commission to provide a scientific opinion, finally adopted in March 2017, according to which a provisional concentration below 44 μg TTX equivalents/kg shellfish meat, based on a large portion size of 400 g, was considered not to result in adverse effects in humans.

In 2013 we studied four eutrophic Puget Sound area lakes to assess both toxin transport to marine waters and its potential accumulation in marine shellfish, specifically mussels. Shellfish beds are extensive throughout Puget Sound, and recreational harvest occurs downstream of our study lakes, so a study goal was to also assess if shellfish consumption poses a human health risk for MC exposure. We confirm, for the first time, freshwater to marine transfer of MCs in Puget Sound with subsequent bioaccumulation of MC by mussels. ELISA analysis estimated maximum MC concentrations in source lakes of 2700 μg/L, up to 0.34 μg/L in marine waters and 6.5 μg/kg in mussels. Confirmatory analyses by LC-MS/MS on water and mussel samples identified MC-LA as the major toxin.

High concentrations of decaBDE (up to 4600 g/kg dry weight) were found in SPM from the Western Scheldt. These levels are possibly related to spillage during use of PBDEs in industries upstream the river Scheldt in Belgium. SPM was identified as an important carrier for higher brominated diphenyl ethers in the aquatic environment. DecaBDE was not found at detectable levels in flounder, bream and mussels. The bioaccumulation of decaBDE in these fish and shellfish samples is apparently limited. Lower brominated PBDE congeners (tetra/penta) were also found in the Western Scheldt as well as in the Rhine delta and the river Meuse, but in much lower concentrations than the decaBDE.

Herein, a new effective detection method of OA was developed based on fluorescence immunosensor and flow cytometry (FCM).

Modified MBs competed with the free OA in the sample solution to bind with the anti-OA monoclonal antibody (OA-MAb). The R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) dye labeled IgG was served as a secondary antibody to perform fluorescence detection. A portable flow cytometry was applied for the in-situ fluorescence quantification.

We sought to evaluate the use of the BMAA content of human scalp hair as an indicator of exposure, as well as the correlation between specific lifestyle or dietary habits, reported as hypothesised exposure risk factors, and BMAA in hair. Scalp hair samples and questionnaires were collected from participants in a small residential village surrounding a freshwater impoundment renowned for toxic cyanobacterial blooms. Data suggested a positive correlation between hair BMAA content and consumption of shellfish, and possibly pork. No statistically significant correlations were observed between hair BMAA content and residential proximity to the water or any other variable. Hair BMAA content was highly variable, and in terms of exposure, probably reflects primarily dietary exposure. However, the BMAA content of human hair may be affected to a great extent by several other factors, and as such, should be used with caution when evaluating human BMAA exposure, or correlating exposure to neurodegenerative disease incidence."

Indeed, several fatal human poisonings attributed to these compounds have been recorded in tropical and subtropical areas. Due to the increasing occurrence of PLTX in temperate areas such as the Mediterranean Sea, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has suggested a maximum limit of 30 µg PLTX/kg in shellfish meat, and has recommended the development of rapid, specific, and sensitive methods for detection and quantitation of PLTX in seafood. Thus, a novel, sensitive cell-based ELISA was developed and characterized for PLTX quantitation in mussels. The estimated limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) were 1.2 × 10-11 M (32.2 pg/mL) and 2.8 × 10-11 M (75.0 pg/mL), respectively, with good accuracy (bias = 2.5%) and repeatability (15% and 9% interday and intraday relative standard deviation of repeatability (RSDr), respectively). Minimal interference of 80% aqueous methanol extract allows PLTX quantitation in mussels at concentrations lower than the maximum limit suggested by EFSA, with an LOQ of 9.1 µg PLTX equivalent/kg mussel meat. Given its high sensitivity and specificity, the cell-based ELISA should be considered a suitable method for PLTX quantitation."

There are several toxicological effects of biogenic amines on humans, especially histamine. It is the causative agent of histamine or scombroid fish poisoning which is a significant public health problem. In individuals with diminished histamine detoxification, ingestion of even a low or moderate histamine- or tyramine-containing fish may lead to food intolerance. Biogenic amines such as putrescine, tyramine and cadaverine can potentiate histamine toxicity. Furthermore, dietary polyamine intake should be minimised in some cancer patients. Besides their potential toxicity, biogenic amines are used for the evaluation of hygienic quality of different marine and freshwater species. Spoilage pattern and biogenic amine formation are species specific. Histamine has been traditionally used as an indicator of the quality of histidine-rich fish (dark-muscle fish).

Since estuarine mangroves are the main hotspots for pollutants, there is a potential for contaminants to accumulate in edible fauna and threaten public health. This study analysed trace metals in muscle tissues of the giant mud crabs (Scylla serrata) and the giant tiger prawns (Penaeus monodon) from the Tanzanian coast, in order to determine the extent of bioaccumulation and public health risks. A total of 180 samples of muscle tissues of S. serrata and 80 of P. monodon were collected from nine sites along the coast. Both species showed high levels of trace metals in the wet season and significant bioaccumulation of As, Cu and Zn. Due to their burrowing and feeding habits, mud crabs were more contaminated compared to tiger prawns sampled from the same sites. Apart from that, the measured levels of Cd, Cr and Pb did not exceed maximum limits for human consumption. Based on the current trend of fish consumption in Tanzania (7.7 kg/person/year), the measured elements (As, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn) are not likely to present health risks to shellfish consumers. Nevertheless, potential risks of As and Cu cannot be ruled out if the average per capita consumption is exceeded. This calls for strengthened waste management systems and pollution control measures."

Clam microbiota were analysed before and after depuration procedures performed in four depuration plants, using culture-dependent and independent approaches. Microbiological counts and NGS data revealed differences in terms of both contamination load and Vibrio community between depuration plants. The novel MLSA-NGS approach allowed for a clear definition of the Vibrio species specific to each depuration plant. Specifically, depurated clam microbiota showed presence of human pathogenic species. Ozone treatments and the density of clams in the depuration tank probably influenced the level of contamination and the Vibrio community composition.

Bivalve mollusks are a unique and ideal group of shellfish for the study and monitoring the aquatic pollution by n-TiO2 because of their filter-feeding behaviour and ability to accumulate toxicants in their tissues. In these animals, exposure to n-TiO2 leads to oxidative stress, immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and genotoxicity, as well as behavioral and physiological changes. This review summarizes the uptake, accumulation, and fate of n-TiO2 in aquatic environments and the possible interactions between n-TiO2 and other contaminants such as heavy metals and organic pollutants. Moreover, the toxicological impacts and mechanisms of action are discussed for a wide range of bivalve mollusks. This data underlines the pressing need for additional knowledge and future research plans for the development of control strategies to mitigate the release of n-TiO2 to the aquatic environment to prevent the toxicological impacts on bivalves and protect public health."

The distribution of DSP events mirrors that of shellfish production areas that have implemented toxin regulations, otherwise misinterpreted as bacterial or viral contamination. Field observations and laboratory experiments have shown that most of the toxins produced by Dinophysis are released into the medium, raising questions about the ecological role of extracelular toxins and their potential uptake by shellfish. Shellfish contamination results from a complex balance between food selection, adsorption, species-specific enzymatic transformations, and allometric processes. Highest risk areas are those combining Dinophysis strains with high cell content of okadaates, aquaculture with predominance of mytilids (good accumulators of toxins), and consumers who frequently include mussels in their diet.

The commonality of the mobilome (the total of all mobile genetic elements in a genome) between aquatic and terrestrial bacteria together with the presence of residual antimicrobials, biofilms, and high concentrations of bacteriophages where the aquatic environment may also be contaminated with pathogens of human and animal origin can stimulate exchange of genetic information between aquatic and terrestrial bacteria.

The precise pathway by which nature constructs brevetoxin A is at present unknown, but strategies for its total synthesis have been contemplated for some time. The synthetic challenge posed by brevetoxin A reflects the high complexity of its molecular structure: 10 oxygen atoms and a chain of 44 carbon atoms are woven into a polycyclic macromolecule that includes 10 rings (containing between 5 and 9 atoms) and 22 stereogenic centres. Particularly challenging are the 7-, 8- and 9-membered rings which allow the molecule to undergo slow conformational changes and force a 90 degrees twist at one of its rings. Here we describe the successful incorporation of methods that were specifically developed for the construction of these rings into an overall strategy for the total synthesis of brevetoxin A in its naturally occurring form.

The detection limit of two published TaqMan RT-PCR assays (A and B) evaluated with RNA run-off transcripts established RT-PCR assay A was more sensitive for detecting low copies of GI.3 RNA whereas RT-PCR assay B was more sensitive for detecting GI.4 and GII.4; however, only assay A was able to detect GI and GII in naturally contaminated shellfish whereas only assay B was able to detect GI and GII in naturally contaminated plankton. The combination of a rapid RNA extraction method followed by both TaqMan RT-PCR assays offers significant advantages for development of routine assays for norovirus detection in bivalve shellfish and shows promise for detection in other high inhibitor environmental sources, such as plankton."

While some reactions are mild, others can include life-threatening anaphylactic shock. It is estimated that food allergies affect 1-2% of the adult population and < or =8% of children. Relatively few foods are to blame for a large majority of allergic reactions to food in the UK, with most reactions being to milk, eggs, peanuts (Arachis hypogea), nuts, fish, shellfish, soyabean, sesame (Sesamum indicum L. ) and wheat. There is currently no cure for food allergy and the few available treatments are focused on relieving the specific symptoms. Consumers with food allergies and food intolerances rely on food labelling to enable them to make informed choices about the foods they eat. Whilst there have recently been important advances in the labelling of food allergens, these advances relate only to requirements for the labelling of the deliberate use of specified food allergens in foods sold pre-packed. In other areas the development of guidance for food manufacturers and retailers on how to assess the risks of possible allergen cross-contamination during food production and manufacture, and then to determine appropriate advisory labelling, is well advanced. Work to address the issue of how to provide appropriate allergen information for foods sold loose, or in catering establishments, is also in progress."

To date, the identification of high risk zones around sewage discharges in shellfish production areas (SPAs) has not been based on NoV data. This study utilised molecular methods for NoV analysis, combined with hydrographic studies, to determine the relationship between NoV concentrations in shellfish and sewage effluent dilution. Cages with mussels and oysters were placed at different distances downstream of sewage discharges in two coastal sites in England. The shellfish were tested for concentrations of NoV (genogroups I and II) and E. coli. Drogue tracking and dye tracing studies were conducted to quantify the dispersion and dilution of sewage effluent in the SPAs. Significant negative associations were found between both total concentrations of NoV (GI + GII) and E. coli and sewage effluent dilution in the SPAs. The total NoV concentrations predicted by the model at 300:1, 1000:1 and 5000:1 ratios of estuarine water to sewage effluent were 1200; 600; and 200 copies/g, respectively. The estimated area of NoV contamination varied according with local pollution source impacts and hydrographic characteristics.

Tissue distribution analysis showed that most of the viruses were concentrated in the digestive tissues of the four species. Mussels and clams were found to be more sensitive to sporadic contamination events, as demonstrated by rapid bioaccumulation in less than 1 h compared to species of oysters. For oysters, concentrations increased during the 24-h bioaccumulation period. Additionally, to evaluate environmental occurrence of HEV in shellfish, an environmental investigation was undertaken at sites potentially impacted by pigs, wild boars, and human waste. Of the 286 samples collected, none were contaminated with hepatitis E virus, despite evidence that this virus is circulating in some French areas.

Despite numerous studies have assessed the impacts of STX on marine bivalves, comparative in vivo study on the toxicity of STX on bivalves with distinct accumulation ability (such as oysters and scallops) has been seldom investigated. The aim of this study was to identify whether distinct sensitivity exists between oysters, Crassostrea gigas, and scallops, Chlamys farreri under the same amount of STX exposure using multiple biomarker responses. The responses of different biochemical markers including oxidative stress markers (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase, and lipid peroxidation) and immunotoxicity biomarkers (hemocyte phagocytosis rate, reactive oxidative species production, and DNA damages) were evaluated in bivalves after 12, 48, and 96 h of exposure to STX. The integrated biomarker responses value combined with two-way ANOVA analysis suggested that STX posed slightly severer stress on scallops than oysters for the extended period of time. This study provided preliminary results on the usefulness of a multi-biomarker approach to assess the toxicity associated with STX exposure in marine bivalves."

Monitoring programs are in place for testing shellfish on a regular basis. In some countries testing is performed using the so-called mouse bioassay, an assay that faces ethical concerns not only because of animal distress, but also because it lacks specificity and results in high amounts of false positives. In Europe, for lipophilic marine biotoxins (LMBs), a chemical analytical method using LC-MS/MS was developed as an alternative and is now the reference method. However, safety is often questioned when relying solely on such a method, and as a result, the mouse bioassay might still be used. In this study the use of a cell-based assay for screening, i. e. , the neuro-2a assay, in combination with the official LC-MS/MS method was investigated as a new alternative strategy for the detection and quantification of LMBs. To this end, samples that had been tested previously with the mouse bioassay were analyzed in the neuro-2a bioassay and the LC-MS/MS method. The neuro-2a bioassay was able to detect all LMBs at the regulatory levels and all samples that tested positive in the mouse bioassay were also suspect in the neuro-2a bioassay. In most cases, these samples contained toxin levels (yessotoxins) that explain the outcome of the bioassay but did not exceed the established maximum permitted levels."

Currently, the primary pathogens associated with shellfish-related outbreaks are noroviruses. This study was conducted to improve understanding of oyster bioaccumulation when oysters were exposed to daily contamination or one accidental contamination event, i. e. , different modes of contamination. Oysters were contaminated with two representative strains of norovirus (GI.1 and GII.3) and then analyzed with real-time reverse transcription PCR. Exposure to a repeated virus dose for 9 days (mimicking a growing area subjected to frequent sewage contamination) led to an additive accumulation that was not significantly different from that obtained when the same total dose of virus was added all at once (as may happen after accidental sewage discharge). Similarly, bioaccumulation tests performed with mixed strains revealed additive accumulation of both viruses. Depuration may not be efficient for eliminating viruses; therefore, to prevent contaminated shellfish from being put onto the market, continuous sanitary monitoring must be considered. All climatic events or sewage failures occurring in production areas must be recorded, because repeated low-dose exposure or abrupt events may lead to similar levels of accumulation. This study contributes to an understanding of norovirus accumulation in oysters and provides suggestions for risk management strategies."

PSTs are produced by prokaryotic freshwater cyanobacteria and eukaryotic marine dinoflagellates. Proliferation of toxic algae species can lead to harmful algal blooms, during which seafood accumulate high levels of PSTs, posing a health threat to consumers. The existence of PST-transforming enzymes was first remarked due to the divergence of PST profiles and concentrations between contaminated bivalves and toxigenic organisms. Later, several enzymes involved in PST transformation, synthesis and elimination have been identified. The knowledge of PST-transforming enzymes is necessary for understanding the processes of toxin accumulation and depuration in mollusk bivalves. Furthermore, PST-transforming enzymes facilitate the obtainment of pure analogues of toxins as in natural sources they are present in a mixture. Pure compounds are of interest for the development of drug candidates and as analytical reference materials. PST-transforming enzymes can also be employed for the development of analytical tools for toxin detection. This review summarizes the PST-transforming enzymes identified so far in living organisms from bacteria to humans, with special emphasis on bivalves, cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates, and discusses enzymes' biological functions and potential practical applications."

In this review, we bring to the forefront the presence of cyanotoxins in extreme environments. Cyanotoxins have been reported especially in polar deserts (both from the Arctic and Antarctica) and alkaline lakes, but also in hot deserts, hypersaline environments, and hot springs. Cyanotoxins detected in these ecosystems include neurotoxins-anatoxin-a, anatoxin-a (S), paralytic shellfish toxins, β-methylaminopropionic acid, N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine and 2,4-diaminobutyric acid- and hepatotoxins -cylindrospermopsins, microcystins and nodularins-with microcystins being the most frequently reported.

The ecological risks assessment of five kinds of heavy metals showed that MOS10 was more than one; the probabilities of five heavy metals affecting more than 10% of aquatic organisms were 49.52%, 24.11%, 17.49%, 22.05%, and 5.66%, respectively, the ecological risk of five main heavy metals was in order Cu > Zn > Cd > Pb > Hg. In the selected thirteen shellfish culture areas, the value of msPAF of seven culture areas was higher than 20%, indicating these areas are highly ecologically contaminated by heavy metals, and the other four shellfish culture areas with value of 0, indicating that these areas have no ecological risk of heavy metals pollution."

The aim of this paper was to provide information about the occurrence and abundance of potentially toxic harmful algal species causing DSP, and the associated concentration of okadaic acid (OA) toxins. The departing assumption was that in the study area there was an increase in the presence both of Dinophysis species and OA and its derivates that could result in a risk to the health of seafood consumers. During 2015-2016, water and shellfish samples were collected in the Mediterranean area (Sardinia, Italy). Dinophysis cells were counted according to Utermöhl's method from water samples, while mass spectrometry was used to identify lipophilic toxins in molluscs. A total of 46 non-compliant samples of Mytilus galloprovincialis were observed. Their non-compliance concerned their OA levels above the legal limit. Among toxic dinoflagellates, D. acuminata and D. sacculus were the species found mostly during DSP events. No cases of human intoxication have been reported, but continuous surveillance of toxic phytoplankton is necessary to predict and prevent its harmful effects on human health."

However, few studies have examined the contamination of bivalves by quinolone and organophosphorus insecticides. Thus, we adapted an established procedure to analyze 8 quinolones and 12 organophosphorus insecticides using liquid and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Surveys in Taiwan have not noted high residual levels of these chemicals in bivalve tissues. A total of 58 samples of freshwater or hard clams were obtained from Taiwanese aquafarms. We identified 0.03 mg/kg of enrofloxacin in one freshwater clam, 0.024 mg/kg of flumequine in one freshwater clam, 0.02 mg/kg of flumequine in one hard clam, 0.05 mg/kg of chlorpyrifos in one freshwater clam, 0.03 mg/kg of chlorpyrifos in one hard clam, and 0.02 mg/kg of trichlorfon in one hard clam. The results indicated that 5.17% of the samples had quinolone insecticide residues and 5.17% had organophosphorus residues. However, the estimated daily intake (EDI)/acceptable daily intake quotient (ADI) indicated no significant risk and no immediate health risk from the consumption of bivalves.

These compounds interact with voltage-gated sodium, potassium and calcium channels and modulate the flux of these ions into various cell types. This review provides a summary of marine neurotoxins, including their structures, molecular targets and pharmacologies. Saxitoxin and its derivatives, collectively referred to as paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), are unique among neurotoxins in that they are found in both marine and freshwater environments by organisms inhabiting two kingdoms of life. Prokaryotic cyanobacteria are responsible for PST production in freshwater systems, while eukaryotic dinoflagellates are the main producers in marine waters. Bioaccumulation by filter-feeding bivalves and fish and subsequent transfer through the food web results in the potentially fatal human illnesses, paralytic shellfish poisoning and saxitoxin pufferfish poisoning. These illnesses are a result of saxitoxin's ability to bind to the voltage-gated sodium channel, blocking the passage of nerve impulses and leading to death via respiratory paralysis. Recent advances in saxitoxin research are discussed, including the molecular biology of toxin synthesis, new protein targets, association with metal-binding motifs and methods of detection.

The presence of these toxins in shellfish is considered an important health threat and their levels in seafood destined to human consumption are regulated in many countries, as well as the levels of other chemically unrelated toxins. We studied the feasibility of immunodetection of saxitoxin and its analogs using a solid-phase microsphere assay coupled to flow cytometry detection in a Luminex 200 system. The technique consists of a competition assay where the toxins in solution compete with bead-bound saxitoxin for binding to an antigonyautoxin 2/3 monoclonal antibody (GT-13A). The assay allowed the detection of saxitoxin both in buffer and mussel extracts in the range of 2.2-19.7 ng/mL (IC(20)-IC(80)). Moreover, the assay cross-reactivity with other toxins of the group is similar to previously published immunoassays, with adequate detection of most analogs except N-1 hydroxy analogs. The recovery rate of the assay for saxitoxin was close to 100%. This microsphere-based immunoassay is suitable to be used as a screening method, detecting saxitoxin from 260 to 2360 μg/kg. This microsphere/flow cytometry system provided similar sensitivities to previously published immunoassays and provides a solid background for the development of easy, flexible multiplexing of toxin detection in one sample."

Although the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants is the recognised reservoir of this organism, E. coli O157 can persist for significant periods of time in animal manure and contaminated soil, from where it can be transferred to watercourses during periods of heavy rainfall. Freshwater ecosystems are often at the interface between agriculture and the wider environment and can play an important role in human exposure to E. coli O157, e. g. though contaminating drinking water, recreational surface waters and shellfish harvesting areas. To mitigate the risk of disease outbreaks, it is essential to have a rapid, robust and reproducible method for the detection of waterborne E. coli O157. Because of the very low infective dose and the high background levels of non-target microbes, detection methods need to be extremely sensitive, and display a high level of specificity. In this review, we briefly outline the environmental pathways for the movement of E. coli O157 into watercourses, and critically assess the methods that are currently used to detect E. coli O157 in freshwater systems. Finally, we determine the suitability of each method for the rapid, accurate and affordable detection of waterborne E. coli O157 and consider some future directions for detecting human pathogens in the environment."

While a number of PST immunoassays exist, the outstanding challenge is linking quantitative response to sample toxicity, as no single antibody reacts to the PST congeners in a manner that correlates with potency. A novel approach, then, is to combine multiple antibodies of varying reactivity to create a screening assay. This research details our investigation of three currently available antibodies for their reactivity profiles determined using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor assay. While our study shows challenges with detection of the R1-hydroxylated PSTs, results indicate that using multiple antibodies may provide more confidence in determining overall toxicity and the toxin profile.

Based on the volunteer’ seafood consumption, estimates of the non-carcinogenic target hazard quotients (THQs) were calculated. The annual concentrations (μg/g, w/w) of Cd were 0.007 (±0.001) in crustaceans, 0.001 (±0.0003) in fish, and 0.446 (±0.034) in mollusks. Lead levels were <limit of detection (LOD) in crustaceans, 0.044 (±0.0032) in fish, and 0.111 (±0.009) in mollusks. All values were within the international guidelines. We observed that 90.9 % of the responders presented an average THQ < 1, which is classified as negligible risk; however, 9.1 % presented THQs between ≥1 and <9.9. These data are important to inform the community of the imminent exposure risk through communication strategies, with the purpose of minimizing exposure and, consequently, the health effects associated with it."

As no human intoxication has been to date attributed to the consumption of 13-SPX-C-contaminated seafood, this toxin is not regulated according to the Codex Alimentarius. Nevertheless, shellfish consumers can be exposed to 13-SPX-C via shellfish consumption. In order to follow the fate of the toxin after ingestion and to verify whether metabolic detoxification could explain the lack of human intoxications, we assessed the metabolism of 13-SPX-C using several in vitro liver systems. First, both phase I and II reactions occurring with rat and human liver S9 fractions were screened. Our results indicated that 13-SPX-C was almost completely metabolized with both rat and human liver S9. Using a receptor binding assay towards nicotinic acetylcholine receptors we demonstrated that the resulting metabolites showed less affinity towards nicotinic acetylcholine receptors than 13-SPX-C. Finally, we showed that 13-SPX-C induced a pronounced increase of gene expression of the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) CYP1A2. The role of this CYP in 13-SPX-C metabolism was clarified using an innovative in vitro tool, CYP1A2-Silensomes™. In summary, this study highlights that liver first-pass metabolism can contribute to the detoxification of 13-SPX-C."

The critical control points for reducing emissions of antibiotics from agriculture are antibiotic stewardship and the pre-treatment of manure and sludge to abate antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Antibiotics are sometimes added to fish and shellfish production sites via the feed, representing a direct route of contamination of the aquatic environment. Vaccination reduces the need for antibiotic use in high value (e. g. salmon) production systems. Consumer and regulatory pressure will over time contribute to reducing the emission of very high concentrations of antibiotics from manufacturing. Research priorities include the development of technologies, practices and incentives that will allow effective reduction in antibiotic use, together with evidence-based standards for antibiotic residues in effluents. All relevant stakeholders need to be aware of the threat of antimicrobial resistance and apply best practice in agriculture, aquaculture and pharmaceutical manufacturing in order to mitigate antibiotic resistance development.

Information about the metabolism of AZAs in shellfish is limited. Therefore, a fraction of blue mussel hepatopancreas was made to study the metabolism of AZA1-3 in vitro. A range of AZA metabolites were detected by liquid chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry analysis, most notably the novel 22α-hydroxymethylAZAs AZA65 and AZA66, which were also detected in naturally contaminated mussels. These appear to be the first intermediates in the metabolic conversion of AZA1 and AZA2 to their corresponding 22α-carboxyAZAs (AZA17 and AZA19). α-Hydroxylation at C-23 was also a prominent metabolic pathway, producing AZA8, AZA12, and AZA5 as major metabolites of AZA1-3, respectively, and AZA67 and AZA68 as minor metabolites via double-hydroxylation of AZA1 and AZA2, but only low levels of 3β-hydroxylation were observed in this study.

Thus, a framework of species distribution models (SDMs), employing MaxEnt modeling, was used to project changes in habitat suitability and distribution of three key paralytic shellfish toxin (PST)-producing dinoflagellate species (i. e. , Alexandrium catenella, A. minutum, and Gymnodinium catenatum), up to 2050 and 2100, across four representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP-2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5; CMIP5). Despite slightly different responses at the regional level, the global habitat suitability has decreased for all the species, leading to an overall contraction in their tropical and sub-tropical ranges, while considerable expansions are projected in higher latitudes, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, suggesting poleward distributional shifts. Such trends were exacerbated with increasing RCP severity. Yet, further research is required, with a greater assemblage of environmental predictors and improved occurrence datasets, to gain a more holistic understanding of the potential impacts of climate change on PST-producing species."

Although there have been no deaths associated with the AZA toxins, humans exposed to AZAs experience severe gastrointestinal symptoms. This toxin class has been shown to be highly cytotoxic, a teratogen to developing fish, and a possible carcinogen in mice. Just recently, the AZAs have been shown to be potassium channel inhibitors. This report employed multiple human cell lines [Jurkat T lymphocytes, Caco-2 intestinal cells, and BE(2)-M17 neuroblastoma cells] in characterizing cytotoxicity and pathways of apoptosis. Cytotoxicity experiments were consistent with published literature that has shown that AZA1 is cytotoxic in both a concentration- and time-dependent manner to each cell type tested, with mean EC(50) values ranging between 1.1 and 7.4 nM. Despite the absence of morphological indices indicating apoptosis, caspase-3/7 activity was higher in all cell types treated with AZA1. Furthermore, in T lymphocytes, the most sensitive cell type, the activities of initiator caspase-2 and caspase-10 and concentrations of intracellular cytochrome c were elevated. DNA fragmentation was also observed for T lymphocytes exposed to AZA1-AZA3. Collectively, our data confirm that AZA1 was highly cytotoxic to multiple cell types and that cells exposed to AZA1 underwent atypical apoptosis, possibly in conjunction with necrotic cytotoxicity."

By comparison, the number of epidemiologically confirmed shellfish-associated outbreaks is relatively low. This study attempts to compare norovirus RNA detection in Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and human health risk. Self-reported customer complaints of illness in a restaurant setting (screened for credible norovirus symptoms) were compared with presence and levels of norovirus as determined by real-time RT-PCR for the batch of oysters consumed. No illness was reported for batches consistently negative for norovirus by real-time RT-PCR. However, norovirus was detected in some batches for which no illness was reported. Overall presence or absence of norovirus showed a significant association with illness complaints. In addition, the batch with the highest norovirus RNA levels also resulted in the highest rate of reported illness, suggesting a linkage between virus RNA levels and health risks. This study suggests that detection of high levels of norovirus RNA in oysters is indicative of a significantly elevated health risk. However, illness may not necessarily be reported after detection of norovirus RNA at low levels."

The majority of BMAA measured by typical methods was released before a significant proportion of protein was hydrolyzed.

Using qPCR assays, the prevalence and quantity of HAdV and HPyV JC and BK were determined in influent and effluent wastewater and receiving waters (river, urban stream, estuarine), then compared with norovirus (NoV) presence, a significant human pathogen which is not necessarily ubiquitously excreted into the environment. HAdV and HPyV were frequently detected in high concentrations in wastewater and wastewater-contaminated waters confirming their use as potential indicators for the presence of human sewage. Overall, there was a correlation between the presence of HAdV and HPyV with NoV but there were some notable exceptions including the higher frequency of NoV compared to HAdV and HPyV in estuarine waters impacted by wastewater overflows.

DDT isomers were determined at parts per billion (microg kg(-1)) levels in foods by pressured fluid extraction followed by gel permeation column cleanup and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection. Among the 98 composite samples, 25 were found positive with DDT levels greater than the limit of quantitation (LOQ) (1 microg kg(-1) for each isomer of DDT).

Furthermore, some omics techniques have the potential to simultaneously detect multiple enteric viruses that cause human disease. Other emerging technologies discussed include microfluidic, aptamer and biosensor-based detection methods developed to detect norovirus with high sensitivity from a simple matrix. Many of these approaches have the potential to be developed as user-friendly onsite detection kits with minimal costs.

All experiments indicated an inversion of the relative proportions of gonyautoxins (GTX2 and GTX3) in shellfish meat during decontamination, whereas saxitoxin (STX) only accumulated during mussel depuration. However, in mussels a density as low as 100 cells/ml led within 10 days to bioaccumulation of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins above the public health threshold. Similar results were observed in clams subjected to fivefold higher cell densities, indicating a less effective assimilation of the dinoflagellate than by mussel.

Okadaic acid (OA), yessotoxin (YTX), and pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2) are three typical LMTs produced by certain marine algae that are closely linked to diarrhetic shellfish poisoning. In this study, a new method of solid phase extraction combined with liquid chromatography - electrospray ionization ion trap tandem mass spectrometry was developed to determine the presence of OA, YTX, and PTX2 in seawater simultaneously. Satisfactory sensitivity, repeatability (RSD<25.00%) and recovery (56.25-70.18%) of the method were achieved. Then, the method was applied to determine the amounts of the three toxins in the coastal seawater. OA and PTX2 were detected in all the seawater samples collected from eight locations along the coastline of Qingdao City, China on October 23, 2012, with concentration ranges of OA 4.24-9.64ngL(-1) and PTX2 0.42-0.74ngL(-1). Monthly concentrations of OA and PTX2 in the seawater of four locations were determined over the course of a year, with concentration ranges of OA 1.41-89.52ngL(-1) and PTX2 below detectable limit to 1.70ngL(-1). The peak values of OA and PTX2 in coastal seawater were observed in August and July, respectively. Our results suggest that follow-up research on the fate modeling and risk assessment of LMTs in coastal seawater should be implemented."

Estimated potential cancer risk to humans increased exponentially with increasing hydrophobicity of the PCB. However, the addition of food-chain sources of PCBs was necessary to cause potential cancer risk to exceed 10(-6). Environmental degradation of the PCB reduced cancer risk by reducing the exposure concentration; 3.3 degradation half-lives were required to reduce cancer risk estimates by one order of magnitude. PCB biotransformation to nongenotoxic metabolites (no increase in the cancer slope factor) by the aquatic animal reduced cancer risk by reducing the steady-state concentration of PCBs in the edible tissue. Even relatively slow biotransformation (e. g. , metabolic half-life of 100 days) reduced cancer risk estimates under the default model conditions. Nonequilibrium conditions, such as limited exposure time, reduced potential cancer risk by reducing contaminant concentrations in the aquatic animal. Risk assessment using toxic equivalency factors predicted substantially greater potential risk for specific congeners than for PCB mixtures. Our evaluation demonstrates that deviation from conventional assumptions used in risk assessment (e. g. , negligible biotransformation and degradation; steady-state equilibrium) can significantly affect cancer risk estimates."

Human exposure to PAHs via consumption of this important commercial shellfish can be a serious public health concern in areas where high PAH contamination exists. Previous PAH immunohistochemical studies have been limited to laboratory-based exposures focusing on one or a few individual PAH compounds. To date, such studies have yet to explore PAH accumulation in oysters, known to have some of the highest levels of PAHs across different food products. Using a monoclonal antibody selective for a range of three- to five-ring PAHs, we present a method to detect and localize complex mixtures of PAHs in oyster tissues via fluorescent immunohistochemistry. Observed immunofluorescence intensity followed a similar trend as measured levels of PAHs in oyster interstitial fluid from PAH-contaminated sites and oysters exposed to the water accommodated fraction of crude oil. This method will be valuable in understanding internal partitioning mechanisms of PAH-exposed oysters and will have important applications in studies on PAH distribution in the tissues of additional organisms for environmental, medical, or veterinary purposes.

Six years later, following the completion of ten reports from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) stating that current reliance on the MBA is scientifically inappropriate, the regulatory climate for testing is almost unchanged, despite the availability of alternatives. The reliance on such a scientifically questionable method, and the welfare concerns for the animals used, highlight the extent of the clash between policy and science. The ongoing struggle to persuade the European Commission to formally adopt non-animal testing methods for all of the relevant toxins has been fruitless, and evidence remains that thousands of mice are used every year in lethal tests that could be replaced.

It is thus urgent to develop methodologies for the detoxification of live bivalves, avoiding their economic and nutritional devaluation. In this context, we tested an adsorption mechanism of paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) based on a cation-exchange resin. The first studies using cultures of Gymnodinium catenatum (natural producers of PST) showed a decrease of about 80% in overall toxicity after 48 h. Interestingly, we found that the toxins are adsorbed differently, with toxins' structural features playing a part in the adsorption capacity via steric hindrance, electronic effects, or the extent of positive charge density (e. g. , dcSTX). The positive effect of the resin in accelerating PST clearance from live mussels (Mytilus edulis) is not evident when compared to resin-free clearance; nevertheless, relevant information could be gathered that will facilitate further in vivo studies. Several factors appear to be at play, namely the competition of natural substances (e. g. , salts, organic matter) for the same binding sites, the blocking of pores due to interactions between molecules, and/or difficulties in resin absorption by mussels. Additionally, the present work revealed the ability of mussels to neutralize pH and proposes bioconversion reactions among the PST molecules."

The daily intake of PCNs associated with this consumption was also determined. A total of 42 composite samples were analyzed by HRGC/HRMS. The highest PCN levels (ng/kg of fresh weight) were found in salmon (227) followed by mackerel (95) and red mullet (68), while the lowest levels of total PCNs corresponded to shrimp (4.9) and cuttlefish (2.7). With the exception of cephalopods and shellfish species, in which tetra-CN was the predominant homologue, penta-CN (60%) was the predominant contributor to total PCNs. For a standard male adult, PCN intake through the consumption of edible marine species was 1.53 ng/day. The highest contributions to this intake (ng/day) corresponded to salmon (0.41), sole (0.28) and tuna (0.24). Concerning health risks, species-specific TEFs such as those reported by WHO and NATO for PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs are not currently available for PCN congeners. Although in general terms the results of the present study do not seem to suggest specific risks derived from exposure to PCNs through fish and seafood consumption, to establish the contribution of individual PCN congeners to total TEQ is clearly necessary for the assessment of human health risks."

The levels of such toxins are regulated internationally, and maximum permitted concentrations in seafood have been established in many countries. A mouse bioassay is an approved method for estimating the levels of PSTs in seafood, but this is now being superseded in many countries by instrumental methods of analysis. Such analyses provide data on the levels of many PSTs in seafood, but for risk assessment, knowledge of the relative toxicities of the congeners is required. These are expressed as ""Toxicity Equivalence Factors"" (TEFs). At present, TEFs are largely based on relative specific activities following intraperitoneal injection in a mouse bioassay rather than on acute toxicity determinations. A more relevant parameter for comparison would be median lethal doses via oral administration, since this is the route through which humans are exposed to PSTs. In the present study, the median lethal doses of gonyautoxin 5, gonyautoxin 6, decarbamoyl neosaxitoxin and of equilibrium mixtures of decarbamoyl gonyautoxins 2&amp;3, C1&amp;2 and C3&amp;4 by oral administration to mice have been determined and compared with toxicities via intraperitoneal injection.

The biosynthesis mechanism of PSTs has been well elucidated in cyanobacteria; however, it remains ambiguous in dinoflagellates. Here, we compared the transcriptome profiles of a toxin-producing dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella (ACHK-T) at different toxin biosynthesis stages within the cell cycle using RNA-seq. The intracellular toxin content increased gradually in the middle G1 phase and rapidly in the late G1 phase, and then remained relatively stable in other phases. Samples from four toxin biosynthesis stages were selected for sequencing, and finally yielded 110,370 unigenes, of which 66,141 were successfully annotated in the known databases. An analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that 2866 genes altered significantly and 297 were co-expressed throughout the four stages. These genes participated mainly in protein metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and the oxidation-reduction process. A total of 138 homologues of toxin genes were identified, but they altered insignificantly among different stages, indicating that toxin biosynthesis might be regulated translationally or post-translationally. Our results will serve as an important transcriptomic resource to characterize key molecular processes underlying dinoflagellate toxin biosynthesis."

The health of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem has deteriorated largely as a result of nutrient overenrichment, concomitant reduction in light availability, and loss of habitats that provide complexity. This has resulted in an ecosystem that is a less vigorous producer of valuable fish and shellfish, less diverse and well organized, and more susceptible to and slower to recover from disturbances. It is not clear that degraded ecosystem health directly threatens human health; in fact sanitation and reductions in loadings of potentially toxic substances have reduced human health risks in recent decades. On the other hand, recently observed outbreaks of the toxin-producing dinoflagellate Pfiesteria piscicida could be a result of deteriorated ecosystem health and pose a human health risk. Monitoring of the environmental conditions, ecosystem health, and human health risks is critically important to the adaptive management of the Chesapeake Bay. Although this monitoring has produced very useful information, monitoring can be more effective if it more directly addressed the multiple uses of the resulting information, applied new technologies, and were more effectively integrated across environmental media, among resources, over space and time scales, and with modeling and research."

The most efficient RNA extraction method was subsequently used for evaluation of three virus recovery methods of blue mussels bio accumulated with NoV GI.3b and GII.4. Mengovirus was evaluated as an internal process control and TaqMan RT-PCRs were used for virus detection. Elution of the two viruses from shellfish tissue differed, indicating a difference in binding affinities.

In 2004, a solid-phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) technique was developed to study algal toxins in New Zealand shellfish harvesting areas. In subsequent years, the basic idea have been further developed. Using a SPATT method, an investigation into diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DSTs) was conducted over a 10.5-month period in 2012 in shellfish farming areas in Lingshan Bay (Yellow Sea, China). This paper discusses the relationship among DSTs in toxic algae, seawater and contaminated shellfish. OA, DTX1 and PTX2 toxins were found in this shellfish farming area from summer to autumn. In shellfish the maximum concentrations of OA and DTX1 were 81 and 41 ng g(-1) respectively. PTX2 was very low. The maximum levels of OA and DTX1 in seawater were 165 and 56 ng g(-1) respectively, and were detected on June, separated by a 14-day period. Shellfish had accumulated the highest levels of OA and DTX1 recorded in this study. Comparison of the variations in DST levels in seawater showed there to be about 2 weeks for administrators to warn of the potential for toxin contamination in shellfish. Further research to explore the relationship between the variables of seawater temperature, sunlight and salinity, and DSTs in shellfish may help to establish a more suitable model for forecasting DST contamination in shellfish."

Presumptive-positive colonies on thiosulfate citrate bile sucrose agar or chromID Vibrio agar were picked and were identified by the API 20E and species-specific PCR systems. V. cholerae isolates were tested further by PCR for the presence of the cholera toxin A subunit gene (ctxA). V. parahaemolyticus isolates were tested by PCR for genes encoding for thermostable direct hemolysin (tdh) and TDH-related hemolysin (trh). V. cholerae was isolated from three samples and V. parahaemolyticus from eight samples. None of these strains harbored species-specific virulence factors. Further, V. alginolyticus was isolated from 40 samples, and V. fluvialis was isolated from 1 sample. Our study provides, for the first time, data for the assessment of exposure to Vibrio spp. in raw fish and bivalves consumed in Switzerland."

Since 2013, several tribal governments and communities have pooled resources to form the Southeast Alaska Tribal Ocean Research (SEATOR) network, with the goal of minimizing risks to seafood harvest and enhancing food security. SEATOR monitors toxin concentrations in shellfish and collects and consolidates data on environmental variables that may be important predictors of toxin levels such as sea surface temperature and salinity. Data from SEATOR are publicly available and are encouraged to be used for the development and testing of predictive algorithms that could improve seafood risk assessment in Southeast Alaska. To date, more than 1700 shellfish samples have been analyzed for paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) in more than 20 locations, with potentially lethal concentrations observed in blue mussels (Mytilus trossulus) and butter clams (Saxidomus gigantea). Concentrations of PSTs exhibit seasonality in some species, and observations of Alexandrium are correlated to sea surface temperature and salinity; however, concentrations above the threshold of concern have been found in all months, and substantial variation in concentrations of PSTs remain unexplained."

In this study, we developed a Bayesian Network (BN) model for forecasting the short-term variations of DSP toxins in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) from Bantry Bay, Southwest Ireland. Data inputs to a BN model from 10 production sites in Bantry Bay included plankton cell densities in sea water, DSP toxin concentration in mussels and sea surface temperature. The model was trained with data from 2014 to 2018, and validated with data of 2019. Validation consisted of predicting the DSP toxin concentration at one production site using the model parameters from the other locations as input values. Model validation showed that the prediction accuracy was higher than 86%. Sensitivity analysis indicated that in general, DSP toxin concentration was more relevant than plankton abundance.

In the present study, the efficacy of HPP to prevent in vivo replication within mice fed HPP-treated MNV-1-seeded oyster extracts was evaluated. Oyster homogenate extracts seeded with MNV-1 were given 5-min, 400-MPa (58,016-psi) treatments and orally gavaged into immunodeficient (STAT-1(-/-)) female mice. Mice orally gavaged with HPP-treated MNV-1 showed significant (P ≤ 0.05) weight loss leading to enhanced morbidity, whereas those given 100 and 200 PFU of HPP-treated MNV-1 were comparable to uninfected controls. MNV-1 was detected, via real-time PCR, within the liver, spleen, and brain of all mice fed non-HPP-treated homogenate but was not detected in the tissues of mice fed HPP-treated homogenates or in uninfected control mice. Hepatocellular necrosis and lymphoid depletion in the spleen were observed in non-HPP-treated MNV-1 mice only. These results clearly show that HPP prevents MNV-1 infection in vivo and validates that viral inactivation by HPP in vitro is essentially equivalent to that in vivo. Further, the data suggest that HPP may be an effective food processing intervention for norovirus-contaminated shellfish and thus may decrease risk to both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals who consume shellfish."

Immunofluorescence assays were performed and Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in 50.0% of gill pools of cockles and 10.0% of gill pools of oysters. In order to evaluate seawater quality in shellfish growing areas, total levels of thermotolerant coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci were determined. This is the first time that Cryptosporidium oocysts were found in shellfish from the coastal region of Brazil, and to the best of our knowledge it is also the first report in Latin America and the case might be of public health importance, reflecting the extension of the contamination on seafood, requiring a need for quality control standards."

To assess the contamination status of shellfish by lipophilic marine toxins in the Bohai Sea, nine species of shellfish periodically collected from five representative aquaculture zones throughout a year were analyzed with a method of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Lipophilic marine toxins, including okadaic acid (OA), dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1), pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2), yessotoxin (YTX), homo-yessotoxin (homo-YTX), azaspiracids (AZA2 and AZA3), gymnodimine (GYM), and 13-desmethyl spirolide C (13-DesMe-C), were detected in more than 95 percent of the shellfish samples. Toxins PTX2, YTX, 13-DesMe-C and GYM were predominant components detected in shellfish samples. Scallops, clams and mussels accumulated much higher level of lipophilic marine toxins compared to oysters. Toxin content in shellfish samples collected from different sampling locations showed site-specific seasonal variation patterns. High level of toxins was found during the stages from December to February and June to July in Hangu, while from March to April and August to September in Laishan. Some toxic algae, including Dinophysis acuminata, D. fortii, Prorocentrum lima, Gonyaulax spinifera and Lingulodinium polyedrum, were identified as potential origins of lipophilic marine toxins in the Bohai Sea. The results will offer a sound basis for monitoring marine toxins and protecting the health of seafood consumers."

Clams (Mya truncata) are a commonly consumed, culturally important and nutritious country food in Iqaluit; however, shellfish may concentrate protozoan pathogens from contaminated waters. The goal of this work was to investigate clams as a potential source of Cryptosporidium and Giardia infections in residents in Iqaluit, Nunavut. The objectives were to estimate the prevalence and genetically characterize Cryptosporidium and Giardia in locally harvested clams. Clams (n = 404) were collected from Iqaluit harvesters in September 2016. Haemolymph (n = 328) and digestive gland (n = 390) samples were screened for Cryptosporidium and Giardia via PCR, and amplified products were further processed for sequence analyses for definitive confirmation. Giardia DNA was found in haemolymph from 2 clams, while Cryptosporidium was not detected. The two Giardia sequences were identified as zoonotic Giardia enterica assemblage B. The overall prevalence of Giardia in clams near Iqaluit was low (0.6%) compared with other studies in southern Canada and elsewhere. The presence of Giardia DNA in clams suggests human or animal faecal contamination of coastal habitat around Iqaluit in shellfish harvesting waters. Results from this study are intended to inform public health practice and planning in Inuit Nunangat."

A total of 100 E. coli isolates (finfish = 42, shellfish = 58) were used in this study. Frequently encountered serotypes in shellfish and finfish were O14, O159, O23, and O5. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a significantly high prevalence of the B2 group in shellfish (p <.05), while B1 and C groups were significantly more prevalent in finfish (p <.05). The prevalence of antibiotic resistance was significantly higher in finfish isolates (85.71%), compared to shellfish isolates (31.03%). The prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs)‐harboring E. coli was high in finfish (28.57%) compared to shellfish (15.5%). The incidence of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) was very low in seafood. Our finding suggests that seafood contaminated with E. coli strains harboring ARGs and virulence genes associated with ExPEC may have a significant health impact on consumers. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Finfish and shellfish are widely consumed all over the world because of their high nutritional quality. However, contaminated seafood consumption would result in serious health issues in consumers. The risk of health would be further complicated if seafood associated infections are caused by antibiotic‐resistant bacteria. Antibiotic‐resistant and extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli isolates from seafood represent the potential risk for consumers. Consumption of raw and partially cooked seafood should be avoided."

Microplastics have been detected in many coastal environments and species, including commercial seafood. This triggers concern about potential economic impacts and the risks of dietary exposure, especially for coastal communities. However, data regarding the levels of microplastics in coastal seafood and their toxicological effects are still limited. Accordingly, the dietary risk is still poorly explored. This review summarizes and discusses recent scientific findings on (i) the presence of microplastics in coastal waters, (ii) the occurrence of microplastics in coastal seafood and the likelihood of trophic transfer, and (iii) the effects of microplastics on coastal fish and shellfish species. Human toxicity data are also reviewed, but the risks for human health are difficult to determine due to limited data. Based on available worldwide data, the estimation of microplastics intake through seafood consumption shows a huge variation. Additionally, a lack of standardized analytical methods complicates the comparison of results between studies and therefore seriously affects the reliability of risk assessments. It is concluded that more exposure and toxicity data are needed properly to assess human health risks of microplastics in coastal seafood, and the lack of data currently impede the derivation of a risk-based food safety standard. The pros and cons of an interim solution, i. e. setting a provisional action level, are being discussed."

Acute exposure to the toxin causes Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning, a potentially lethal syndrome of gastrointestinal- and seizure-related outcomes. Both advanced age and male sex have been suggested to contribute to interindividual DA susceptibility. To test this, we administered DA doses between 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg body weight to female and male C57Bl/6 mice at adult (7-9-month-old) and aged (25-28-month-old) life stages and observed seizure-related activity for 90 min, at which point we euthanized the mice and collected serum, cortical, and kidney samples. We observed severe clonic-tonic convulsions in some aged individuals, but not in younger adults. We also saw an association between advanced age and the incidence of a moderately severe seizure-related outcome, hindlimb tremors, and between advanced age and overall symptom severity and persistence. Surprisingly, we additionally report that female mice, particularly aged female mice, demonstrated more severe neurotoxic symptoms following acute exposure to DA than males. Both age and sex patterns were reflected in tissue DA concentrations as well: aged mice and females had generally higher concentrations of DA in their tissues at 90 min post-exposure. This study contributes to the body of work that can inform intelligent, evidence-based public health protections for communities threatened by more frequent and extensive DA-producing algal blooms."

Herein, a sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC−MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of antibiotic residues (mainly amphenicols) consisting of chloramphenicol (CAP), thiamphenicol (TAP), florfenicol (FF), and florfenicol amine (FFA) in aquatic products. Amphenicols were well separated on a Kinetex F5 (100 mm × 3.0 mm, 2.6 µm) chromatographic column with the mobile phases of 1 mM ammonium acetate aqueous solution and methanol solution and measured after positive and negative electrospray ionizations using four internal standards. To our knowledge, it was the first time to report the good performance of F5 column and four internal standards for the determination of amphenicols. The established method featured a good linear relationship between chromatographic peak area ratios and the concentrations of amphenicols (R2 > 0.992), a wide and low detection matrix-based range of 0.01−5 μg/L, a low detection limit of 0.01 μg/kg, etc. The spiked assays evidenced the accuracy and reliability of the developed method with the recoveries between 84.0 and 105%, the intraday relative standard deviations (RSDs) over the range of 0.769−13.7%, and the interday RSDs over the range of 0.582−13.3%. Finally, the proposed method was applied to investigate amphenicol residues in various aquatic products, including fish, shrimp, crab, shellfish, and other aquatic species."

Ni, As, Ag, and Sb were in relatively lower concentrations, whereas relatively higher accumulation of Cr, Mn, Zn, and Se were recorded. Mn, Zn, and Pb were present in higher concentrations than the guidelines of various authorities. There were significant differences in metal accumulation among different fish, prawn, or shellfish species. Target hazard quotient (THQ) and target cancer risk (TR) were calculated to estimate the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks, respectively. The THQ for individual heavy metals were below 1 suggesting no potential health risk. But combined impact, estimated by hazard index (HI), suggested health risk for M. pancalus consumption.

Among chemicals of environmental concern, the plastic additive tetrabromobisphenol A displayed the highest CE-inhibitory capacity in all species.

Results showed that the MSPD technique could effectively mitigate matrix interference, but its recoveries of PSTs were significantly lower than those of the HCl and AcOH extraction methods followed by carbon SPE purification. The molar concentrations of M-toxins obtained by the MSPD method were generally lower than those analyzed by the HCl and AcOH extraction methods, which demonstrated a weak chemical conversion of C1/2 and GTX2/3 due to the heating process. Most of the PSTs were relatively stable in scallop tissues during 1-month storage at -20 °C, while the concentrations of PSTs in scallop tissues obviously changed after 6 months due to the degradation and transformation of PSTs during long-term storage at -20 °C.

Tank experiments were conducted where mussels were fed with the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum. Water and shellfish were sampled over a six day period to determine toxin concentrations in the shellfish meat and water, as well as algal cell densities. The maximum summed toxin concentration determined was 367 µg STX eq. /100 g shellfish tissue, more than six times higher than the regulatory action limit in the Philippines. Several uptake and depuration cycles were observed during the study, with the first observed within the first 24 h coinciding with high algal cell densities. Toxin burdens were assessed within different parts of the shellfish tissue, with the highest levels quantified in the mantle during the first 18 h period but shifting towards the gut thereafter. A comparison of toxin profile data evidenced the conversion of GTX1,4 in the source algae to the less potent GTX2,3 in the shellfish tissue. Overall, the study illustrated the temporal variability in Perna viridis toxin concentrations during a modelled algal bloom event, and the accumulation of toxin from the water even after toxic algae were removed."

During previous investigations carried out in our laboratory by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), the occurrence of a high percentage of esters in relation to the total OA equivalents has been observed in several shellfish species. The determination of these kinds of toxins using LC/MS or other chemical methods requires a hydrolysis step in order to convert the sterified compounds into the parent toxins, OA, dinophysistoxins-1 (DTX-1) and dinophysistoxins-2 (DTX-2). Most of the hydrolysis procedures are based on an alkaline hydrolysis reaction. However, despite hydrolysis being a critical step within the analysis, it has not been studied in depth up to now. The present paper reports the results obtained after evaluating the hydrolysis process of an esterified form of OA by using a standard of 7-O-acyl ester with palmitoyl as the fatty acid (palOA). Investigations were focused on checking the effectiveness of the hydrolysis for palOA using methanol as solvent standard and matrices matched standards. From the results obtained, no matrix influence on the hydrolysis process was observed and the quantity of palOA converted into OA was always above 80%. The analyses of different Spanish shellfish samples showed percentages of palOA in relation to the total OA esters ranging from 27% to 90%, depending on the shellfish specie."

PSP events in this area impact on fisheries management and are also responsible for severe human intoxications by contaminated shellfish. Within the framework of a HAB monitoring program carried out at several coastal sites along the Chubut Province, we analyzed spatiotemporal patterns of PSP toxicity in shellfish during 2000-2011. The highest frequency of mouse bioassays exceeding the regulatory limit for human consumption was detected in spring and summer, with average values of up to ≈70% and 50%, respectively. By contrast, a lower percentage of positive bioassays (2-8%) or no toxicity at all was usually detected during autumn and winter. The most intense PSP events were usually observed between November and January, with values of up to 4,000 μg STX eq 100 g-1, and showed a marked interannual variability both in their magnitude and location. In addition, a severe PSP outbreak was recorded during autumn, 2009, at Camarones Bay, with toxicity values of up to 14,000 μg STX eq 100 g-1. The scallop Aequipecten tehuelchus showed significantly higher toxicity values compared to other shellfish species in SJG and SMG, suggesting a lower detoxification capacity. Our results contribute to the understanding of HABs dynamics on the Argentine Patagonian coast."

As a way to overcome the shortcomings involved in the reference methods of analysis set by legislations, alternative procedures are envisaged. This paper describes the development of different immunosensors for the analysis of OA, focusing on the comparison of their sensitivity, precision, ease of use and sample matrix effects. Initially, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based immunosensor was developed, which enabled the quantification of the toxin in mussel samples at concentrations in the range of the 160 microg kg(-1) European regulatory limit with good percentages of recovery. Nevertheless, calibration curves with spiked mussel samples showed that matrix effects could not be neglected. Alternatively, a flow-immunosensing system based on kinetic exclusion measurements was developed achieving the theoretical lowest limit of detection enabled by the affinity of the anti-OA antibody (IC(70)=0.03 microg L(-1) in the assay solution). This highly sensitive automated system allows rapid and reliable OA quantification, with no significant matrix effects for the analysis of spiked mussel and scallop samples. Performance features such as high sensitivity and precision, low limits of detection and simplicity of the analysis protocol, shows the biosensing-systems based on kinetic exclusion measurements for toxin detection in shellfish samples as highly performing tools for rapid and continuous screening."

As with other foods, public health risks exist but these mostly involve open water environments or products which are consumed raw or undercooked. Unlike wild fisheries, inland aquaculture systems can minimise public health risks by proper site evaluation and good aquacultural practices. Responsible use of pesticides and therapeutants can prevent violative residues to assure product safety and wholesomeness. The implementation of hazard analysis and critical control point regulations will further enhance the preventive approach to hazards control. The most challenging public health risks arise from shellfish production in open, surface waters, where both naturally-occurring and trace environmental residue contaminants can bioaccumulate in tissues and may cause disease outbreaks (and, in severe cases, death). Water quality certification programmes and field surveillance efforts including product sampling, testing and monitoring can address critical safety criteria. This paper focuses primarily on public health risks associated with production: however, the fact that consumer risks also occur as a result of the processing of aquacultural products and that foodborne diseases arise additionally from unsanitary handling or preparation and storage at incorrect temperatures (as is the case for food products from other animals) must also be taken into consideration."

Estuaries contain sediment repositories of Hg and are also critical habitat for marine fish and shellfish species consumed by humans. MeHg biotransfers from sites of production in estuarine sediments to higher trophic levels via both benthic and pelagic pathways. In this study, we investigated the potential for Hg biotransfer to estuarine food webs across a Hg contamination gradient in the Gulf of Maine. Despite the variation in sediment Hg concentrations across sites (>100 fold), Hg concentrations in biota ranged by only 2-4 fold for each species across sites. Sediment contamination alone explained some variation in Hg and MeHg concentrations in biota across sites. However, biogeochemical and ecological factors also explained significant variation in Hg bioaccumulation across species. Contaminated sites had higher total organic carbon concentrations in sediments, which related to a decrease in Hg bioaccumulation (measured as biota-sediment concentration factors). Moreover, concentrations of MeHg were higher in pelagic-feeding than benthic-feeding fauna (determined from delta13C), indicating the importance of pelagic pathways in transferring MeHg. Lastly, the proportion of total Hg as MeHg increased with trophic level (measured as delta15N).

To determine the impact of this decision, shellfish biotoxin data collected between 2009 and 2019 were examined. They showed that 85 samples exceeded the DSP regulatory limit (0.45%) and that excluding pectenotoxins would have reduced this by 10% to 76 samples. The incidence (1.3%) and maximum concentrations of pectenotoxins (0.079 mg/kg) were also found to be low, well below the current European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) safe limit of 0.12 mg/kg. Inclusion within the DSP regulations is scientifically flawed, as pectenotoxins and okadaic acid have a different mechanism of action, meaning that their toxicities are not additive, which is the fundamental principle of grouping toxins. Furthermore, evaluation of the available toxicity data suggests that pectenotoxins have very low oral toxicity, with recent studies showing no oral toxicity in mice dosed with the PTX analogue PTX2 at 5000 µg/kg. No known human illnesses have been reported due to exposure to pectenotoxins in shellfish, a fact which combined with the toxicity data indicates that they pose negligible risk to humans.

The samples were collected from nine locations in the Istrian aquatory, Croatia. Isolation of Campylobacter was done according to standard ISO method, and species were identified using multiplex PCR. Isolates identified as C. jejuni and C. lari were genotyped using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to determine the potential source of contamination. Among 108 examined samples of bivalve molluscs, mussels dominated and were the only ones found positive for the presence of Campylobacter (25.6%). In total, 19 C. lari and 1 C. jejuni strains were isolated. C. lari isolates found in this study belong to 13 sequence types (STs), and 9 of them are newly described in this paper. Two out of the four previously described C. lari STs that were found in this study were previously found in human stool. The only C. jejuni isolate was found to be sequence type 1268, which belongs to ST-1275 clonal complex that is almost exclusively found in seabirds and can sporadically cause infection in humans. Regarding the obtained results, introducing surveillance of thermotolerant Campylobacter in shellfish in the Republic of Croatia is advised as an improvement for public health safety."

The detection of this toxin in contaminated shellfish is essential for human health preservation. A broad range of studies indicate that mammalian Na+,K+-ATPase is a high affinity cellular receptor for PLTX. The toxin converts the pump into an open channel that stimulates sodium influx and potassium efflux. In this work we develop a detection method for PLTX based on its binding to the Na+,K+-ATPase. The method was developed by using the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to monitor biomolecular reactions. This technique does not require any labeling of components. The interaction of PLTX over immobilized Na+,K+-ATPase is quantified by injecting different concentrations of toxin in the biosensor and checking the binding rate constant (Kobs). From the representation of Kobs versus PLTX concentration, the kinetic equilibrium dissociation constant (K(D)) for the PLTX-Na+,K+-ATPase association can be calculated. The value of this constant is K(D) = 6.38 × 10-7 ± 6.67 × 10-8 M PLTX. In this way the PLTX-Na+,K+-ATPase association was used as a suitable method for determination of the toxin concentration in a sample. This method represents a new and useful approach to easily detect the presence of PLTX-like compounds in marine products using the mechanism of action of these toxins and in this way reduce the use of other more expensive and animal based methods."

The As content and the consumption rate are both treated as probability distributions, taking into account the variability of the amount in the seafood and individual consumption habits. The Monte Carlo simulation technique is utilized to conduct an assessment of exposure due to the daily intake of inorganic As from As-contaminated seafood. Exposure is evaluated according to the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) established by the FAO/WHO and the target risk based on the US Environmental Protection Agency guidelines. The assessment results show that inorganic As intake from five types of fish (excluding mullet) and shellfish fall below the PTWI threshold values for the 95th percentiles, but exceed the target cancer risk of 10(-6). The predicted 95th percentile for inorganic As intake and lifetime cancer risks obtained in the study are both markedly higher than those obtained in previous studies in which the consumption rate of seafood considered is a deterministic value.

The effects of DST-containing dinoflagellate Dinophysis acuta on bivalve clearance and respiration rate were investigated in the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) exposed to different algal densities in a controlled laboratory study. Results showed that M. edulis exposed to D. acuta displayed a reduced clearance rate compared to M. edulis exposed to equivalent bio-volumes of the non-toxic cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina. Furthermore, M. edulis ceased to feed on D. acuta after 1 to 4 h, depending on D. acuta densities. The quickest response was observed at the highest densities of D. acuta. The estimated total amount of DST accumulated in the M. edulis exceeded the regulatory limit for human consumption and furthermore, intoxication of the M. edulis seemed to occur faster at high cell toxicity rather than at high cell density. However, respiration rates were, similar, irrespective of whether M. edulis were fed single diets of R. salina, D. acuta or a mixed diet of both algal species. In conclusion, the DST-containing D. acuta had a severe negative effect on the clearance of M. edulis, which can affect the conditions of the M. edulis negatively. Hence, DST may cause low quality M. edulis, due to reduced feeding when exposed to DST-containing D. acuta."

Although human health effects of Hg contamination were a major theme, the workshop also explored effects on marine biota. The workgroup focused on three major topics: a) the biogeochemical cycling of Hg in marine ecosystems, b) the trophic transfer and bioaccumulation of MeHg in marine food webs, and c) human exposure to Hg from marine fish and shellfish consumption.

We used the benchmark dose (BMD) method to determine the threshold limits of Cd in urine for renal dysfunction and in blood for osteoporosis for assessing the human health risk. Our results revealed that seawater acidification could increase the Cd accumulation in shellfish by 10-13% compared to the situations under current pH levels. Under the lower seawater pH level, the daily intake of Cd could increase by 21%-67% among shellfish-only consumers, and by 13%-17% among the general population. Our findings indicated that seawater acidification would lead to a marginal increase in Cd intake among humans in shellfish-only consumers.

Bacteriophages have been identified as potential indicators for these viruses, but have not been used in shellfish management outside of the USA. This study aimed to determine the background levels of F-RNA phage in five Australian oyster growing areas with a history of sewage spills and closures, over an 18-month period. In addition, oysters from five growing areas impacted by adverse sewage events were investigated for F-RNA phage, Escherichia coli, norovirus (NoV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV). F-RNA phage ≤ 60 pfu/100 gm shellfish flesh were found to represent a conservative background level in the surveyed areas. Following two of the five sewage spills, elevated phage levels were observed in most sample sites less than 4 days post spill. By 7 days, most sites from all events had phage < 30 pfu/100 gm. NoV was detected in day 1 and day 6 samples from one event when all phage were ≤ 30 pfu/100 gm. NoV was also detected in a day 3 sample from another event with < 30 phage pfu/100 gm, however, multiple replicate samples had elevated phage levels. The results of this study add evidence on the potential use of F-RNA phage as a tool in early re-opening of oyster harvest areas post sewage spills. However, it also highlights the need to better understand situations where phage testing may be ineffectual, and the importance of sampling at multiple sites and over multiple time points, to effectively capture evidence of contamination."

In the European Union, the seafood sector is of considerable economic importance to member states with household spending on seafood produce totalling €54.8 billion in 2016. Within the EU, shellfish aquaculture supports livelihoods and employment in many rural communities throughout the region. Harmful algal blooms pose considerable risk to consumer safety and in turn, stability of the shellfish market. If contaminated produce was to make it to the market the health risk to the public could be considerable, but the damage to the sector through loss of trust in producers would also be significant. Mytilus edulis account for a considerable portion of the aquaculture sector in the Northeast Atlantic. At present, no scientific tool is available to industry regulators, to allow them to trace mussel produce to its source, uphold food safety standards and ensure consumer confidence. The present study uses chemical analysis of shells and soft tissues to classify individual M. edulis to their site of harvest. The use of random forest classification of trace element composition has revealed location specific elemental signatures for all examined sites. This led to the correct classification of 100% of individuals sampled to their respective harvesting locations, including two sites located just 6 km apart within the same bay. The protocol demonstrated here provides the basis for a scientifically driven traceability framework for shellfish produce."

We analyzed seasonal variation in the MC content of primary and secondary consumers, and used dietary analysis (gut contents and stable isotopes) to improve understanding of cyanotoxin transport in food webs. Periods of elevated toxin concentration were associated with peaks in the abundance of genes specific to Microcystis and MC toxin production (mcyD). Peak toxin levels in consumer tissues coincided with peak MC concentrations in seston. However, toxins in tissues persisted in overwintering populations suggesting that potential health impacts may not be limited to bloom periods. Interspecific differences in tissue MC concentrations were related to feeding habits and organic matter sources as pelagic fishes ingested a greater proportion of algae in their diet, which resulted in greater MC content in liver and muscle tissues. Sediments contained a greater proportion of allochthonous (terrestrial) organic matter and lower concentrations of MC, resulting in lower toxin concentrations among benthic detritivores. Among shellfish, the benthic suspension feeder Rangia cuneata (wedge clam) showed seasonal avoidance of toxin ingestion due to low feeding rates during periods of elevated MC.

Unlike most measures of pollutant levels however, FIB concentration metrics, such as most probable number (MPN) and colony-forming units (CFU), are not direct measures of the true in situ concentration distribution. Therefore, there is the potential for inconsistencies among model and sample-based water quality assessments, such as those used in the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) program. To address this problem, we present an innovative approach to assessing pathogen contamination based on water quality standards that impose limits on parameters of the actual underlying FIB concentration distribution, rather than on MPN or CFU values. Such concentration-based standards link more explicitly to human health considerations, are independent of the analytical procedures employed, and are consistent with the outcomes of most predictive water quality models. We demonstrate how compliance with concentration-based standards can be inferred from traditional MPN values using a Bayesian inference procedure. This methodology, applicable to a wide range of FIB-based water quality assessments, is illustrated here using fecal coliform data from shellfish harvesting waters in the Newport River Estuary, North Carolina. Results indicate that areas determined to be compliant according to the current methods-based standards may actually have an unacceptably high probability of being in violation of concentration-based standards."

Previous toxicological studies in mice suggested the involvement of acetylcholine receptors. In this work, the effects of the 13-desmethyl C spirolide on the activity and the expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) were analyzed using a human neuroblastoma cell model. The 13-desmethyl C spirolide inhibited the acetylcholine-induced calcium signal with a reduction of the maximum response to acetylcholine in the presence of the toxin. The 13-desmethyl C spirolide also reduced binding of the mAChR specific antagonist [(3)H]QNB to neuroblastoma cells. The effect of the 13-desmethyl C spirolide persisted after toxin removal and was inhibited by protection of the primary binding site with high concentrations of atropine suggesting an interaction of the spirolide with the orthologous binding site of mAChR. Moreover, the toxin induced a change in the characteristics of the membrane-associated M3 mAChRs, although it did not alter the total levels of M3 mAChR protein. The 13-desmethyl C spirolide targets mAChRs causing a reduction of function, a decrease of specific antagonist binding to mAChRs, and alteration of membrane-bound receptors that might have important toxicological implications."

The neurotoxin domoic acid is produced by the globally-distributed diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia. This toxin is responsible for amnesic shellfish poisoning, which can result in illness or death in humans and regularly causes mass mortalities of marine mammals and birds. Domoic acid production by Pseudo-nitzschia cells is known to be regulated by nutrient availability, but potential interactions with increasing seawater CO(2) concentrations are poorly understood. Here we present experiments measuring domoic acid production by acclimatized cultures of Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta that demonstrate a strong synergism between projected future CO(2) levels (765 ppm) and silicate-limited growth, which greatly increases cellular toxicity relative to growth under modern atmospheric (360 ppm) or pre-industrial (200 ppm) CO(2) conditions. Cellular Si:C ratios decrease with increasing CO(2), in a trend opposite to that seen for domoic acid production. The coastal California upwelling system where this species was isolated currently exhibits rapidly increasing levels of anthropogenic acidification, as well as widespread episodic silicate limitation of diatom growth. Our results suggest that the current ecosystem and human health impacts of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms could be greatly exacerbated by future ocean acidification and 'carbon fertilization' of the coastal ocean."

Total plate count, total coliform, and fecal coliform levels were determined and correlated with the presence of adenovirus. Samples of fish, bivalve mollusks, crustaceans, and cephalopods were collected from supermarkets, landing centers, and retail fish markets of Mumbai, India for the study. Overall, the adenovirus DNA was detected in 21.27% of all the samples analyzed. The highest incidence was detected in clams (14.89%), followed by oysters, shrimps, and finfish (2.13% each). High prevalence of enteric adenovirus in filter-feeding bivalves, such as clams and oysters, as well as in fish suggests persistent fecal contamination of coastal waters in the region of study. The occurrence of adenoviruses in samples showed a positive correlation with the bacteriological indicators of fecal contamination, suggesting that fecal indicator bacteria may be used to monitor the presence of adenoviruses in seafood. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This research demonstrates the occurrence of human adenoviruse (HAdV) in fresh seafood and the utility of fecal coliforms as indicators of HAdV presence in seafood. The study emphasizes the need to identify HAdV in seafood as a human health hazard and implement measures to prevent sewage pollution of fish and shellfish harvesting areas in India."

Bloom samples (n = 50) were collected from Finnish freshwater sites during summer months of 2002 and 2003. These samples were screened for the presence of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) using the Jellett rapid PSP screening test. Samples testing positive for PSTs (n = 7) were further analyzed with saxiphilin- and voltage-gated sodium channel [(3)H]-STX-binding radioreceptor assays and liquid chromatography using fluorescence and mass spectrometric analysis. The results indicated that saxitoxin (STX) was the only PST analogue in the samples and that it was present in high concentrations, as much as 1 mg L(-1). Microscopic analysis revealed that 95%-100% of the phytoplankton in the positive samples consisted of Anabaena lemmermannii. The trophic status of lakes in which STX-containing blooms were found varied from oligotrophic to hypertrophic. All the lakes had high nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios. In some instances, samples had been collected from sites where swimmers had reported adverse health effects, and in three such cases, reported adverse health effects were associated with sites from which samples testing positive for STX had been received. Symptoms of fever, eye irritation, abdominal pains, and skin rash were reported in children aged 2-10 years after exposure to the water. These were not the adverse human symptoms typical of STX poisoning; rather, they represented acute effects often reported following recreational exposure to cyanobacterial blooms."

Previous analyses of okadaic acid (OA) and related toxins in these two species by HPLC revealed significant amounts of OA and DTX2 in D. acuta, but only trace amounts of OA in D. caudata cells, and led to the erroneous conclusion that the contribution of the latter species to autumn LST events was negligible. Recent analyses by LC-MS/MS of individually picked cells of D. acuta and D. caudata have shown that both species may have high levels of PTX2 (up to 30 pg and 130 pg cell(-1), respectively) and that this toxin can be the dominant toxin during toxic outbreaks associated with Dinophysis spp. Although the quick conversion of PTX2 to PTX-2SA in mussels may reduce the risks for human health, these results have important implications for monitoring programmes. The complex toxin profile of shellfish exposed to Dinophysis spp. populations should be taken into account when making decisions on the toxin control methods to be used as the basis of the programme. Conclusive toxicological studies are required to elucidate the public health relevance of the different PTXs derivatives and to provide the scientific basis for regulations."

Recently, YTXs and AZAs have been described as compounds with subacute cardiotoxic potential in rats owed to alterations of the cardiovascular function and ultrastructural heart damage. These molecules are also well known in vitro inducers of cell death. The aim of this study was to explore the presence of cardiomyocyte death after repeated subacute exposure of rats to AZA-1 and YTX for 15 days. Because autophagy and apoptosis are often found in dying cardiomyocytes, several autophagic and apoptotic markers were determined by western blot in heart tissues of these rats. The results showed that hearts from YTX-treated rats presented increased levels of the autophagic markers microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and beclin-1, nevertheless AZA-1-treated hearts evidenced increased levels of the apoptosis markers cleaved caspase-3 and -8, cleaved PARP and Fas ligand. Therefore, while YTX-induced damage to the heart triggers autophagic processes, apoptosis activation occurs in the case of AZA-1. For the first time, activation of cell death signals in cardiomyocytes is demonstrated for these toxins with in vivo experiments, which may be related to alterations of the cardiovascular function."

In addition to their features of low cost, portability, easy operation, high efficiency and high bioactivity, micro/nano biosensors have great potential to realize on-the-spot, rapid detection of shellfish toxins. This review focuses on the most recent advances in the development of micro/nano biosensors for shellfish toxin detection. These biosensors are mainly classified into five categories according to their transducer detection principles, which include optical devices, electrochemical sensors, electrochemiluminescence, field-effect transistors, and acoustic devices. Sensor strategies, toxin analytes, biosensitive elements, coupling methods and field detection performance are highlighted to discuss the applications of shellfish toxin detection. With advances in sensor technology, biomaterials, microfabrication and miniaturized electronics, micro/nano biosensors applied to in-field fast detection of shellfish toxins are expected to play a critical role in food safety, environmental monitoring, and foreign trade in the foreseeable future.

For several years this family of phycotoxins has been posing a threat to human health since they can bioaccumulate in shellfish. With the aim of replacing current biological assays, such as the mouse or hemolytic assays, we investigated using the Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cell line to detect palytoxin and related compounds. Cell death induced by the effects of PlTX and analogues on Na+, K+-ATPase were measured using the 1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan (MTT) assay for mitochondrial reductase activity as a surrogate for cell number. The specificity of the Neuro-2a cell-based assay for palytoxin detection was confirmed by using ouabain, which also acts on Na+, K+-ATPase. Pre-treatment of the Neuro-2a cells with ouabain minimizes the effects of palytoxin. The specificity of the Neuro-2a assay was confirmed by the finding that cell death was not detected when Neuro-2a cells were exposed to other phycotoxins with unrelated cellular targets. When the Neuro-2a assay was used to detect palytoxin in mussel extracts spiked with levels of palytoxin around the proposed regulatory value of 250 microg palytoxin/kg shellfish, a good correlation was observed between the levels found and the expected values. We conclude by proposing an experimental design for functional assays using the Neuro-2a cell line for the specific detection of four neurotoxic phycotoxin families: saxitoxins, brevetoxins, ciguatoxins and palytoxins."

For this water and sand samples (10 stations), shellfishes (21 species) and fishes (43 species) were collected and the concentrations of 210Po and 210Pb were measured by radiochemical separation followed by alpha counting method using ZnS(Ag) detector. 210Pb concentration in the marine water (mean: 7.6 ± 3.31 mBq l-1) is always higher than 210Po (mean: 4.1 ± 1.97 mBq l-1).

To circumvent this problem, we have developed a large-scale method for solid-phase extraction (SPE) of lipophilic biotoxins from natural microalgal blooms in seawater. To enhance subsequent purification of toxins adsorbed on the column, we included a filtration step to release the toxins from the cells while removing insoluble compounds and cellular debris. The efficacy of the method was illustrated by extraction and purification of okadaic acid and dinophysistoxin-2 from a high-density Dinophysis acuta bloom in Spain and from a mixed bloom containing low densities of D. acuta in Norway. Isolation of the toxins adsorbed on the SPE column was simple and efficient, and results obtained so far indicate that the method is potentially applicable to a wide range of microalgal toxins such as azaspiracids, pectenotoxins, spirolides and microcystins. The method should also be useful for harvesting toxins from large-scale microalgal cultures, and for bioprospecting for and isolation of bioactive natural products from marine and freshwater environments."

Reported here is the use of the globally distributed speckled cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea as a bioassay test organism for the selective detection of PSP toxicity of Anabaena circinalis aqueous extract and STX.

Similarly, N. cinerea was shown to be tolerant of toxin-containing aqueous extracts of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, Microcystis aeruginosa, and Nodularia spumigena while being sensitive to A. circinalis. Peak sensitivity to STX was 60 min postinjection with a KD₅₀ of 31.2 ng/g body weight. While this was approximately 3-fold less sensitive than the mouse bioassay, the insect test organism was around 34-fold smaller in mass than a mouse (20 g); thus one-tenth the amount of toxin in absolute quantity was required to reach an ED₅₀ level.

Animal toxins include venomous snakes and arthropods, venoms of certain marine creatures, skin secretions of dart-poison frogs, and poisonous fish, shellfish, and crabs. There are plant poisons such as curare, and bacterial poisons such as botulinum toxin. These act at single or multiple sites of the neuromuscular apparatus interfering with voltage-gated ion channels, acetylcholine release, depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, or generation and spread of the muscle action potential. The specific actions of these toxins are being widely exploited in the study of neuromuscular physiology and pathology. Some toxins have proved to be valuable pharmaceutical agents. Poisoning by natural neurotoxins is an important public health hazard in many parts of the world, particularly in the tropics. Poisoning may occur by a bite or a sting of a venomous animal, or by the ingestion of poisonous fish, shellfish or other marine delicacies. Contaminated food is a vehicle for poisons such as botulinum toxin. Clinically, a cardinal feature in the symptomatology is muscle paralysis with a distribution characteristic of myasthenia gravis, affecting muscles innervated by cranial nerves, neck flexors, proximal limb muscles, and respiratory muscles. Respiratory paralysis may end fatally. This paper reviews from the clinical and pathophysiologic viewpoints, naturally occurring environmental neurotoxins acting at the neuromuscular junction."

In our experimental conditions, B[a]P induced CYP1A induction and morphological changes in mussel gills and a significant B[a]P accumulation in soft tissue. Conversely, exposing PBMCs to organic extracts obtained from contaminated mussels, resulted in a significant reduction of cell viability and cell glutathione content, and in an increase in DNA laddering. This confirms that consumption of mussels from B[a]P polluted waters might affect human health. Our data lead us to suggest that CYP1A activity in mussel gills may be useful (more than the amount of detected PAHs in the mussel edible tissue) as a marker in assessment of risk for health of consumers exposed to PAHs through ingestion of shellfish."

A great variety of mollusc species are therefore of commercial importance throughout the world. Episodes of poisoning occasionally happen to the consumers of molluscs, the main hazard being represented by bivalve molluscs. These organisms are filter-feeders, feeding mainly on a wide range of phytoplankton species. Among the thousands of species of microscopic algae at the base of the marine food chain, there are a few dozen which produce potent toxins. One major category of impact occurs when toxic phytoplankton are filtered from the water as food by shellfish, which then accumulate the algal toxins to levels which can be lethal to humans. Incidences of poisoning related to marine algal toxins come under the main categories of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP), diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP), and amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP), depending upon the toxins and the symptoms that they cause. Since the beginning of the 1990s, a research program has been initiated to examine the toxin profiles in mussels from the Adriatic Sea. Since then, a number of polyether toxins have been isolated and characterized, some of which represent new additions to the DSP class of biotoxins. During this investigation, new types of toxins have also been isolated. The recent application of LC-MS methods for the detection of Adriatic marine biotoxins made it possible to speed up the analysis of toxic samples."

We then used a similar model trained using lagged environmental variables to hindcast out-of-sample (OOS) shellfish toxicities during April-October in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Hindcast OOS accuracies were low (37-50%); however, we found forecasting using environmental variables may be useful in predicting the timing of early summer blooms.

The poisoning was characterized by a constellation of clinical symptoms and signs. Among the most prominent features described was memory impairment which led to the name Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning [ASP]. Domoic acid is produced by certain marine organisms, such as the red alga Chondria armata and planktonic diatom of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Since 1987, monitoring programs have been successful in preventing other human incidents of ASP. However, there are documented cases of domoic acid intoxication in wild animals and outbreaks of coastal water contamination in many regions world-wide. Hence domoic acid continues to pose a global risk to the health and safety of humans and wildlife. Several mechanisms have been implicated as mediators for the effects of domoic acid. Of particular importance is the role played by glutamate receptors as mediators of excitatory neurotransmission and the demonstration of a wide distribution of these receptors outside the central nervous system, prompting the attention to other tissues as potential target sites. The aim of this document is to provide a comprehensive review of ASP, DOM induced pathology including ultrastructural changes associated to subchronic oral exposure, and discussion of key proposed mechanisms of cell/tissue injury involved in DOM induced brain pathology and considerations relevant to food safety and human health."

Target species were from various trophic levels and are among those frequently harvested for human consumption. We found evidence that arsenic concentrated in some marine species, but did not tend to follow classic trophic patterns for biomagnification or bioaccumulation.

The aim of this study is to examine the potential risk of microplastics entering in the human food chain through this shellfish species, investigating the dynamics of the uptake, egestion (faeces) and rejection (pseudofaeces) of microplastics in Pacific oysters under controlled conditions. M. gigas collected from a farm in the San Teodoro lagoon (Italy), were exposed to 60 fluorescent orange polystyrene particles L-1 of known sizes (100, 250 and 500 μm). The uptake of each particle size was 19.4 ± 1.1%, 19.4 ± 2% and 12.9 ± 2% respectively. After exposure M. gigas were left to depurate for 72 h, during which 84.6 ± 2% of the particles taken up were released whilst 15.4 ± 2% were retained inside the shell cavity. No microplastic particles were found in the animals' soft tissues. The results of this study, suggest that depuration is an effective method to reduce presence of large microplastic particles, in the size range 100-500 μm, in M. gigas.

The enteric nervous system (ENS) plays a crucial role in the regulation of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, neuropeptides produced by ENS affects the epithelial barrier functions. In the present work we used a two-compartment human coculture model containing the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line and polarized colonic epithelial monolayers (Caco-2) to study the OA intestinal permeability. First, we have determined OA cytotoxicity and we have found that OA reduces the viability of SH-SY5Y in a dose-dependent way, even though DTX1 is 4 to 5 times more potent than OA. Besides DTX1 is 15 to 18 orders of magnitude more potent than OA in decreasing transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of caco-2 cells without inducing cytotoxicity. Permeability assays indicate that OA cross the monolayer and modulates the neuropeptide Y (NPY) secretion by neuroblastoma cells. This NPY also affects the permeability of OA. This offers a novel approach to establish the influence of OA neuronal action on their diarrheic effects through a cross talk between ENS and intestine via OA induced NPY secretion. Therefore, the OA mechanisms of toxicity that were long attributed only to the inhibition of protein phosphatases, would require a reevaluation."

Our study aimed to analyze the occurrence and characteristics of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)- and carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli among bivalves. A total of 522 bivalve samples were collected along Portuguese shellfish production areas. Homogenized samples were screened for E. coli contamination on corresponding selective plates, allowing for concomitant growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae. E. coli growth was observed in 39% of the samples. Subsequent selective screening identified nine samples (4.4%) contaminated with ESBL producers, corresponding to E. coli (n = 7) and K. pneumoniae (n = 2), while a single carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (0.5%) was identified. ESBLs were all CTX-M-types commonly identified in human isolates, i. e. , CTX-M-32 (n = 4), CTX-M-15 (n = 4), and CTX-M-14 (n = 1). The carbapenemase producer harbored the blaGES-5 gene located on a ColE plasmid. Clonality was evaluated by multilocus sequence typing, identifying E. coli backgrounds as ST10, ST23, ST540, ST617, ST746, SLV206, and SLV2325, commonly identified among environmental and human strains. The K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to ST834, ST15, and DLV644. The occurrence of ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in bivalves reveals how the marine environment constitutes a reservoir of critical bacterial pathogens, thus potentially representing a risk to human health."

In decreasing frequency, noroviruses (NoV) GII and HAdV, rotaviruses (RoV), astroviruses (AsV), NoV GI and finally hepatitis E viruses (HEV) were also observed. Nine types of infectious HAdV were identified. HPyV and EV were found in 80% of seawater samples, NoV GII in 60%, HAdV and SaV in 40% and AsV and RoV in 20%. NoV GI and HEV were not detected in seawater. Intact and infectious HAdV-41 were detected in one of the two seawater samples that gave a positive qPCR result. Hepatitis A viruses were never detected in any water types. Analysis of transcriptomic data from giant clams revealed homologues of fucosyltransferases (FUT genes) involved in ligand biosynthesis that strongly bind to certain NoV strains, supporting the giant clams ability to bioaccumulate NoV. This was confirmed by the presence of NoV GII in one of the three batches of giant clams placed in a contaminated marine area. Overall, all sample types were positive for at least one type of virus, some of which were infectious and therefore likely to cause public health concerns."

One approach to improving the recovery and detection of V. vulnificus without sacrificing assay time is through the use of immunomagnetic separation (IMS). The aim of this study was to develop and optimize an IMS protocol using anti-H (antiflagellar) antibody for determining the level of V. vulnificus in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) suspensions and spiked oyster homogenate. Six monoclonal antibodies were produced by immunizing mice at 2-week intervals by injection of 50 microg of purified V. vulnificus ATCC 27562 flagellin. Antibodies that exhibited high anti-H titers were coated onto Cowan I Staphylococcus aureus cells and sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin G immunomagnetic beads. The two reagents were used to determine the species specificity of the selected antibodies, which positively identified and coagglutinated 70 isolates identified genetically as V. vulnificus and did not react with 40 Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolates or nine other Vibrio species. The IMS protocol was optimized for PBS and oyster homogenate spiked with three different strains of V. vulnificus. IMS with V. vulnificus-spiked PBS yielded binding of 19 to 57%, and IMS with spiked oyster homogenate carried out at two V. vulnificus levels exhibited binding of 25 to 57%. The IMS protocol for V. vulnificus could be used to concentrate and detect V. vulnificus in seawater and shellfish homogenate."

Then, the toxic profiles of each species and dose of STX equivalents ingested by a 60 kg person from 400 g of shellfish were determined to establish the health risk assessment. The toxins with the highest prevalence detected were gonyautoxin-4/1 (GTX4/GTX1), gonyautoxin-3/2 (GTX3/GTX2), neosaxitoxin (neoSTX), decarbamoylsaxitoxin (dcSTX), and saxitoxin (STX), with average concentrations of 400, 2800, 280, 200, and 2000 µg kg-1 respectively, a species-specific variability, dependent on the evaluated tissue, which demonstrates the biotransformation of the analogues in the trophic transfer with a predominance of α-epimers in all toxic profiles.

In general, tetra-CN was the predominant homologue in all food groups except for fruits and pulses, which had greater proportions of hexa-CNs. The dietary intake of total PCNs was subsequently determined. For calculations, recent data on consumption of the selected food items were used. Intake of PCNs was estimated for five population groups of Catalonia: children, adolescents, male and female adults, and seniors. When the dietary intake of total PCNs was expressed in nanogram per kilogram of body weight per day, it was age-dependent, with the highest and lowest values corresponding to children (1.65) and seniors (0.54), respectively. The largest contribution to the daily PCNs intake came from oils and fats and from cereals.

Considerable information is however missing, particularly at the molecular and metabolic levels involving toxin uptake, distribution, compartmentalization and biotransformation and the interaction of DSTs with aquatic organisms. Recent contributions to the knowledge of DSTs arise from transcriptomics and proteomics research. Indeed, OMICs constitute a research field dedicated to the systematic analysis on the organisms' metabolisms. The methodologies used in OMICs are also highly effective to identify critical metabolic pathways affecting the physiology of the organisms. In this review, we analyze the main contributions provided so far by OMICs to DSTs research and discuss the prospects of OMICs with regard to the DSTs toxicology and the significance of these toxins to public health, food safety and aquaculture."

Lead concentrations were almost negligible with the exception of frozen common sole, which showed median levels above the legal limit. Tin levels in canned products were far below the maximum regulatory limit, indicating that no significant tin was transferred from the can.

Direct coastal monitoring of Alexandrium spp. can provide early warning of potential shellfish contamination and risks to consumers and so a rapid, sensitive, portable and easy-to-use assay has been developed for this purpose using an innovative planar waveguide device. The disposable planar waveguide is comprised of a transparent substrate onto which an array of toxin-protein conjugates is deposited, assembled in a cartridge allowing the introduction of sample, and detection reagents. The competitive assay format uses a high affinity antibody to paralytic shellfish toxins with a detection signal generated via a fluorescently labelled secondary antibody. The waveguide cartridge is analysed by a simple reader device and results are displayed on a laptop computer. Assay speed has been optimised to enable measurement within 15 min. A rapid, portable sample preparation technique was developed for Alexandrium spp. in seawater to ensure analysis was completed within a short period of time. The assay was validated and the LOD and CCβ were determined as 12 pg/mL and 20 pg/mL respectively with an intra-assay CV of 11.3% at the CCβ and an average recovery of 106%.

Edible meats from summer flounder (Paralicthys dentatus), striped bass (Marone saxatilis), Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulates), and hard clam (Mercenaria mercenaria) were tested. Total arsenic was highest in summer flounder, followed by hard clam, then striped bass, and finally, Atlantic croaker. Total arsenic was higher in summer flounder collected during the spring, as these fish migrated into the Inland Bays from the continental shelf, compared with levels in summer flounder collected during the fall, after these fish had spent the summer in the Inland Bays. Similarly, striped bass collected in the early spring close to the ocean had higher total arsenic levels compared with levels detected in striped bass collected later during the year in waters with lower salinity. Speciation of arsenic revealed low concentrations (0.00048-0.02 microg/g wet wt) of toxic inorganic arsenic. Dimethylarsinic acid was more than an order of magnitude greater in hard clam meats than in the other species tested, a finding that was attributed to arsenic uptake by phytoplankton and subsequent dietary uptake by the clam. Risk assessment using the inorganic arsenic concentrations was used to conclude that a fish consumption advisory is not warranted."

We used a large set of 68 strains to the aim of fully characterizing the toxin profiles of the Dutch A. ostenfeldii in consideration of recent reports of novel toxins. Alexandrium ostenfeldii is known as a causative species of paralytic shellfish poisoning, and consistently in the Dutch population we determined the presence of several paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) including saxitoxin (STX), GTX2/3 (gonyautoxins), B1 and C1/C2. We also examined the production of spiroimine toxins by the Dutch A. ostenfeldii strains. An extensive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis revealed a high intraspecific variability of spirolides (SPX) and gymnodimines (GYM). Spirolides included 13-desMethyl-spirolide C generally as the major compound and several other mostly unknown SPX-like compounds that were detected and characterized. Besides spirolides, the presence of gymnodimine A and 12-Methyl-gymnodimine A was confirmed, together with two new gymnodimines. One of these was tentatively identified as an analogue of gymnodimine D and was the most abundant gymnodimine (calculated cell quota up to 274 pg cell-1, expressed as GYM A equivalents). Our multi-clonal approach adds new analogues to the increasing number of compounds in these toxin classes and revealed a high strain variability in cell quota and in toxin profile of toxic compounds within a single population."

Despite many studies on the occurrence, prevalence, biology and molecular phylogeny of Amoebophrya spp. , little attention has been given to toxin dynamics of host population following parasitism. Using Amoebophrya sp. infecting the paralytic shellfish toxin (PSP)-producing dinoflagellate Alexandrium fundyense, we addressed the following questions: (1) does parasitism by Amoebophrya sp. alter toxin content and toxin profiles of the dinoflagellate A. fundyense over the infection cycle? and (2) do parasite dinospores produced at the end of the infection cycle retain host toxins and thus potentially act as a vector to convey PSP toxin through the marine microbial food-web? Toxin time-course experiments showed that the PSP toxin contents did not vary significantly over the infection cycle, but mean toxin content for infected cultures was significantly higher than that for uninfected cultures. Host toxins were not detected in the free-living, dinospore stage of the parasite. Therefore, our results indicate that Amoebophrya sp. does not function as a vector for transferring PSP toxins to higher trophic levels. Rather, Amoebophrya infections appear to play an important role in maintaining healthy ecosystems by transforming potent toxins-producing dinoflagellates into non-toxic dinospores, representing ""edible food"" for consumers of the marine microbial food-web during toxic algal bloom event."

In this study, a reliable method for the analysis of extracellular PSP toxins in the culture medium of marine toxic dinoflagellates was developed for the first time using graphitized carbon black-solid-phase extraction and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. The limit of quantification of typical PSP toxins in algal culture medium ranged from 0.072 μg/L to 0.151 μg/L under optimal conditions. Satisfactory absolute recoveries (87.5%-102.4%), precision (relative standard deviation ≤ 7.6%), and linearity (R2 ≥ 0.9998) were also achieved. In addition, the proposed method was applied to screen and determine the extracellular PSP toxins of two typical toxigenic dinoflagellates, Alexandrium minutum and Alexandrium tamarense. The total concentrations of the extracellular PSP toxins in A. minutum and A. tamarense over the whole growth period were within 2.0-735.5 and 2.0-19.2 μg/L, respectively. The concentrations of extracellular PSP toxins varied remarkably in the different growth stages of A. minutum and A. tamarense, and the contents of some extracellular PSP toxins were substantially higher than those of intracellular PSP toxins. Therefore, the extracellular PSP toxins released by toxigenic red tide algae cannot be ignored, and their environmental fate, bioavailability, and potential harm to aquatic environment need to be investigated in future studies."

Differences in reported mercury concentrations can significantly affect per capita mercury intake estimates, pointing to the importance of spatially refined mercury concentration data.

To improve and establish better and more sensitive diagnostics for allergies and immunotherapeutics, large quantities of pure allergens are required. To establish a reproducible method for the generation of pure recombinant tropomyosin we utilized in this study different Escherichia coli strains (NM522, TOP10 and BL21(DE3)RIPL). In addition, isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) induction was compared with a novel auto-induction system to allow the generation of larger quantities of recombinant allergen. We demonstrated that the B-strain of E. coli is better for the expression of TM compared to the K-strain. Moreover, a higher yield could be achieved when using the auto-induction system, with up to 62 mg/l. High yield expressed recombinant TM from King prawn (KP) was compared to recombinant TM from Black tiger prawn (Pen m 1). We demonstrated that recombinant TM from KP and known isoallergen Pen m 1 have very similar molecular and immunological characteristics.

A homogenate of whole mussel meat was solubilized at low pH (2.8) or high pH (11.1), followed by centrifugation and reprecipitation of the solubilized mussel proteins at the isoelectric pH. In a second centrifugation, precipitated proteins were collected. These processes resulted in 81 (acid solubilization) and 72% (alkaline solubilization) reduction in the initial DTX-1 toxin content of the mussel meat. No other DSP toxins were found in the protein isolates. Acid processing of mussel meat resulted in 50% reduction in the total lipid content, while alkaline treatment did not significantly affect the lipid content. The effect of citric acid and calcium chloride addition to the mussel meat-water homogenate on lipid and toxin content was also investigated. A poor correlation factor was surprisingly obtained between reductions in DTX-1 toxin and lipids in protein isolates from processed toxic mussels. Results from an analytical mass balance of the DTX-1 toxin during acid processing showed that 61% of this toxin ended up in the aqueous supernatant after the second centrifugation.

Intra-specific variability was observed in growth and toxin production, with the strain IFR-PAU-16.1 apparently able to withstand higher salinities than the strain IFR-PAU-16.2. On the whole, DA does not appear to act as an osmolyte in response to sudden salinity changes. Since most of the shellfish harvesting areas of bivalve molluscs in France are located in areas where the salinity generally varies between 30 and 35, Pseudo-nitzschia australis blooms might potentially impact public health and commercial shellfish resources in these places."

However, few studies have compared the bioaccumulation potential of different test species over a range of sediment-contaminant concentrations and profiles. The bioavailability of sediment-related contaminants was evaluated using sediments collected from sites (n = 12) throughout the Salish Sea, British Columbia, Canada. Two benthic marine invertebrates-the Baltic clam Macoma balthica and the polychaete worm Neanthes arenaceodentata-were exposed for 28 days in a controlled environment to these field-collected coastal sediments. The congener-specific uptake of legacy polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and emergent polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) was determined using high-resolution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in sediments and in invertebrates after the experimental exposure. The polychaete Neanthes accumulated lower concentrations of PCBs but higher concentrations of PBDEs. The present study indicates that differences in bioaccumulation between these two invertebrates shape the accumulation of PCB and PBDE congeners, reflect differences in feeding strategies, and reveal the physicochemical properties of the contaminants and sediment properties. Because biota-sediment accumulation factor values are often calculated for environmental monitoring or site-specific impact assessments, our results provide insight into potentially confounding factors and the need for caution when selecting indicator species for coastal marine pollution."

Streamlining of existing methods for several classes of lipophilic toxins, based on liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry, was pursued. The resulting simplified LC-MS/MS method is focused on the separation and detection of just the AZAs and total DSTs using a C18 Hypersil gold column. Filter vials are used to expedite and simplify sample handling. The method has a run time of 7.25 min. LOQs for the AZAs and DSTs in shellfish were 0.3-0.4 µg/kg. Recoveries (AZAs and total DSTs) for three spiking levels in three matrixes ranged from 68 to 129%. Trueness was established using certified reference materials. Method equivalence was established using shellfish provided blind by the Washington State Department of Health Public Health Laboratory (WA DOH PHL).

Although the molecular mechanism of neuronal PSP toxicity has been well studied, several issues remain unresolved, notably the in vivo hepatic antioxidative responses to this neurotoxin. Aphantoxins extracted from a natural isolate of A. flos-aquae DC-1 were resolved by high performance liquid chromatography. The primary components were gonyautoxins 1 and 5 and neosaxitoxin. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were treated intraperitoneally with either 5.3 or 7.61 (low and high doses, respectively) μg saxitoxin (STX) equivalents (eq)/kg of A. flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins. Antioxidative responses in zebrafish liver were examined at different timepoints 1-24h post-exposure. Aphantoxin administration significantly enhanced hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) content 1-12h post-exposure, indicative of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. By contrast, levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) in zebrafish liver declined significantly after 3-24h exposure, suggesting that GSH participates in MDA metabolism. A significant upregulation of the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was observed, suggesting that aphantoxins induce lipid peroxidation in zebrafish liver and are likely to be hepatotoxic. Hepatic levels of MDA and GSH, and of the three enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx), therefore provide potential biomarkers for studying environmental exposure to aphantoxins/PSPs from cyanobacterial blooms."

Live shellfish were allowed to bioaccumulate different input titers of NV for time periods from 4 to 24 h. In some experiments, depuration by shellfish that bioaccumulated NV and Escherichia coli bacteria was allowed to proceed for 24 or 48 hours. Dissected stomach (St), digestive diverticula (DD), adductor muscle (AM), and hemolymph cells (HC) tissues were assayed for NV by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. An internal RNA standard control was added to the RT-PCR to identify the presence of inhibitors to RT-PCR. NV titers in DD tissues before and after depuration were estimated using quantitative RT-PCR end-point dilution. NV was found in the alimentary tract (DD or St) at all concentrations of input virus, but was present more frequently after exposure to higher levels of virus. NV was detected in AM and HC only following exposure to higher levels of virus. In experiments where depuration by oysters was continued for 48 h, depuration of bacteria was efficient (95% reduction of bacteria), but minimal (7%) reduction of NV titers from DD tissues was detected. These findings indicate that NV can localize both within and outside the alimentary tract of shellfish, and NV is poorly depurated using conditions favorable for E. coli depuration."

As these viruses are very resistant to inactivation, the sanitary consequences are contamination of food, including molluscan shellfish. There are four major problems with NoV detection in shellfish samples: low levels of virus contamination, the difficulty of efficient virus extraction, the presence of interfering substances that inhibit molecular detection, and NoV genetic variability. The aims of this study were to adapt a kit for use with a method previously shown to be efficient for detection of NoV in shellfish and to use a one step real-time reverse transcription-PCR method with addition of an external viral control. Comparisons of the two methods using bioaccumulated oysters showed that the methods reproducibly detected similar levels of virus in oyster samples. Validation studies using naturally contaminated samples also showed that there was a good correlation between the results of the two methods, and the variability was more attributable to the level of sample contamination. Magnetic silica very efficiently eliminated inhibitors, and use of extraction and amplification controls increased quality assurance. These controls increased the confidence in estimates of NoV concentrations in shellfish samples and strongly supported the conclusion that the results of the method described here reflected the levels of virus contamination in oysters.

Discharges of fecal polluted water into the sea have been considered as one of the main reasons for the presence of Arcobacter in shellfish, and this may represent a risk for public health. In this study, the European Union shellfish food safety criteria based on levels of Escherichia coli were studied in relation to their capacity to predict the presence of Arcobacter species. In addition, the accumulation factor (AF) that measures the concentration ratio between the microbes present in the shellfish and in the water, was also studied for both bacteria. The results show that the presence of E. coli correlated with the presence of the potentially pathogenic species A. butzleri and A. cryaerophilus. However, in 26.1% of the shellfish samples (corresponding to those taken during summer months) E. coli failed to predict the presence of, for instance A. butzleri and A. skirrowii, among other species. In the rest of the samples a significant correlation between the concentration of E. coli and Arcobacter spp. (mussels and oyster; R2=0.744) was found. This study indicates that the presence of E. coli can predict the presence of pathogenic Arcobacter species in shellfish samples harvested from water with temperatures lower than 26.2°C. Consumption of shellfish collected at higher temperatures which may not be permissive to the growth of E. coli but does allow growth of Arcobacter spp. , may represent a risk for consumers."

In northwestern Iberia, D. acuminata has a long growing season, from spring to early autumn, and populations develop as soon as shallow stratification forms when the upwelling season begins. In contrast, D. acuta blooms in late summer, when the depth of the pycnocline is maximal and upwelling pulses are moderate. In situ observations on the hydrodynamic regimes during the two windows of opportunity for Dinophysis species led us to hypothesize that D. acuta should be more sensitive to turbulence than D. acuminata. To test this hypothesis, we studied the response of D. acuminata and D. acuta to three realistic turbulence levels low (LT), ε ≈ 10-6 m2 s-3; medium (MT), ε ≈ 10-5 m2 s-3 and high (HT), ε ≈ 10-4 m2 s-3generated by Turbogen, a highly reproducible, computer-controlled system. Cells of both species exposed to LT and MT grew at rates similar to the controls. Marked differences were found in the response to HT: D. acuminata grew slowly after an initial lag phase, whereas D. acuta cell numbers declined. Results from this study support the hypothesis that turbulence may play a role in shaping the spatio-temporal distribution of individual species of Dinophysis. We also hypothesize that, in addition to cell disturbance affecting division, sustained high shear generated by microturbulence may cause a decline in Dinophysis numbers due to decreased densities of ciliate prey."

Exposure of abalone to PST supplemented feed for 50 days did not affect behaviour or survival but saw accumulation of up to 1.6 μg STX-equivalent 100 g⁻¹ in the abalone foot tissue (muscle, mouth without oesophagus and epipodial fringe), which is ∼50 times lower than the maximum permissible limit (80 μg 100 g⁻¹ tissue) for PSTs in molluscan shellfish. The PST levels in the foot were reduced to 0.48 μg STX-equivalent 100 g⁻¹ after scrubbing and removal of the pigment surrounding the epithelium of the epipodial fringe (confirmed by both HPLC and LC-MS/MS). Thus, scrubbing the epipodial fringe, a common procedure during commercial abalone canning, reduced PST levels by ∼70%. Only trace levels of PSTs were detected in the viscera (stomach, gut, heart, gonad, gills and mantle) of the abalone. A toxin reduction of approximately 73% was observed in STX-contaminated abalone held in clean water and fed uncontaminated food over 50 days. The low level of PST uptake when abalone were exposed to high numbers of A. minutum cells over a prolonged period may indicate a low risk of PSP poisoning to humans from the consumption of H. laevigata that has been exposed to a bloom of potentially toxic A. minutum in Australia.

The direct effects of numerous HAB species have been demonstrated on adult bivalves, whereas the effects on critical early life stages remain relatively unexplored.

Oocytes were more affected than spermatozoa and their mortality and ROS production increased in the presence of D. sacculus and PTX2, respectively. A decrease in fertilization success was observed at concentrations as low as 0.5 cell mL-1 of Dinophysis spp. and 5 nM of PTX2, whereas no effect of OA could be observed. The effect on fertilization success was higher when both gamete types were concomitantly exposed compared to separate exposures, suggesting a synergistic effect.

While DSP is a non-fatal gastrointestinal syndrome, PSP is a neurological syndrome which can lead to death by respiratory paralysis in high intoxication scenarios. In Portugal, the presence of both DSP and PSP toxins leads to recurrent seasonal bans of bivalve harvesting. On a few occasions, the bans were not placed in time, not properly disseminated to the public or were disregarded by recreational harvesters. Several cases of poisonings have been studied in collaboration between health authorities and the laboratory in charge of the biotoxin monitoring programme. Some of the outbreaks have even called the attention of the local media. In several of these recorded cases, a common trait has emerged throughout the years: bivalve harvest had often been done during very low tides attributed to either new or full moons. These tides expose intertidal bivalves more widely, increase harvesting time, and allow picking of larger-sized specimens. In some occasions, the consumers were extremely unfortunate because a noxious coincidence had occurred: larger-sized specimens were available but had attained the highest toxin content of the toxic season. This review alerts that despite costly monitoring programmes have been perfected through the years, human poisonings still take place due to the rapid increase in toxin levels and/or disrespect of harvest bans."

The resistance patterns differed depending on the tested samples. The crustaceans Penaeus monodon and Marsupenaeus japonicus harbored more antibiotic-resistant bacteria, whereas the isolates from the crustacean Litopenaeus vannamei and the shellfish Busycon canaliculatus had high tolerance to eight heavy metals tested.

Among chalcophile heavy metals, Pb and Zn display significant enrichments relative to the local geochemical backgrounds suggesting anthropogenic sources. They appear to be preferentially associated with the sedimentary organic matter that, according to the isotopic composition, is mainly formed by the incorporation of different proportions of macroalgae and macrophytes that have a significant bioaccumulation capacity.

In this study, we examined the bioaccumulation, depuration and organ distribution of Cd in the M. chilensis, from 109Cd-labelled bulk seawater and from feeding with 109Cd-labelled algae. The uptake of 109Cd via seawater displayed a simple exponential kinetic model suggesting that cadmium activity tends to reach an equilibrium value of 1.838+/-0.175 ng g(-1) (mean+/-asymptotic standard error, p < 0.001) after 78+/-9 days. The depuration rate for 109Cd accumulated via seawater was slow, with only 21% of the total 109Cd accumulated in the whole mussel being eliminated after 52 days. Total elimination of Cd in mussels was adequately described by a double component kinetic model, in which the biological half-life for the long-lived component represents more than 6 months. In contrast, depuration after radiolabelled food uptake was fast, reaching only 20% of retention in 10 days. This knowledge of the long half-life of cadmium accumulated via seawater as well as the non-negligible level of cadmium accumulated into the shells is relevant to the management of Cd levels in this species and the refinement of detoxification processes in order to comply with authorized Cd levels."

Cu, Zn, and Cd levels in sediment exceeded the Chinese marine sediment quality criteria. The geoaccumulation index was highest for Cd followed in a decreasing order by Zn, Pb, Cu, Ni, and Cr. Metal levels were highest in the four mollusk species. The oyster and veined rapa whelk had the highest bioaccumulation factors, indicating that these two species would be well suited for monitoring the metal pollution in this area. Our comparison of estimated daily intake values for human consumption of the seafood species to the Food and Agricultural Organization-recommended daily dietary allowances indicate potential health risks from the intake of Cd from all shellfish other than our crab species and Zn intake from oyster consumption. An analysis of target hazard quotients identified noncarcinogenic health risks from Cd (in all shellfish analyzed except for our crab species), Cu, and Zn (in oysters and veined rapa whelks). Moreover, an analysis of cancer risk from Pb ingestion detected an increased risk for consumption of all shellfish except for the crab species. Health risks seem especially pronounced for the consumption of oysters and the veined rapa whelks; a seafood advisory may be warranted for these mollusks."

The toxins act by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels stopping the inflow of sodium ions and the generation of action potentials. Exposure from marine sources occurs as a result of consuming shellfish which have concentrated the toxins, and freshwater exposure can occur from drinking water although there have been no acute poisonings from the latter source to date. Previously, the majority of research into this group of toxins, collectively known as the paralytic shellfish toxins, has focused on acute exposure resulting in paralytic shellfish poisoning. While acute exposure guidelines exist for both sources, there are no chronic exposure guidelines and there has been minimal research into this pattern of exposure despite the known role of electrical activity in neurogenesis. We aimed to investigate this pattern of exposure and its potential effects on neurodevelopment using model neuronal cells. PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to STX (0.25-3 μg/l) for 7 days, after which time they were stained with TRITC-Phalloidin, to observe adverse morphological effects. Cells exposed to STX had a significant decrease (18-85%) in long axonlike projections, instead exhibiting a significant increase in shorter projections classified as filopodia (p < 0.05). The results suggest that extended low-dose exposure to STX can inhibit proper neurite outgrowth at concentrations well below guideline levels for both sources of exposure making it a potential public health concern."

The approach was evaluated for 2 contrasting shellfish harvesting areas. Through a meta-data analysis and using environmental data (in situ, satellite observations and meteorological nowcasts and forecasts), key environmental drivers were identified and used to develop models to predict E. coli and biotoxin concentrations within shellfish. Models were trained and evaluated using independent datasets, and the best models were identified based on the model exhibiting the lowest root mean square error. The best biotoxin model was able to provide 1 wk forecasts with an accuracy of 86%, a 0% false positive rate and a 0% false discovery rate (n = 78 observations) when used to predict the closure of shellfish beds due to biotoxin.

After incubation, DNA was extracted from bacteria colonies on the membrane filters by using QIAamp DNA extraction kit. Water samples were also tested for the presence of traditional indicator bacteria including: heterotrophic plate count, total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and Enterococcus bacteria. The marker esp gene was detected in one site of Bayou Cumbest, an area where human populations reside. Data from this study indicates higher concentrations of indicator bacteria compared to the recommended acceptable levels.

In coastal waters reduction of nitrogen loading is a key strategy for prevention of noxious and toxic algal blooms. Best management practices (BMPs) can be successful tools for mitigating such pollutants in runoff, but BMPs must be tailored to individual situations for maximum effectiveness. This study examines the efficacy of a set of BMPs installed in the coastal resort Town of Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, USA. The BMPs targeted the highly-impervious (90%+) drainage area of two stormwater outfall pipes emptying into recreationally used Banks Channel. Mitigation measures included replacement of impervious pavement with pervious concrete and construction of an infiltration chamber in the parking lot of a local recreational seaside club. Significant reductions were achieved in total stormwater discharge (62%), as well as loading of the fecal indicator bacteria Enterococcus (76%) and total nitrogen (TN - 87% decrease). Additionally, there were reductions in loading of total phosphorous (TP) and total suspended solids (TSS) to estuarine waters following BMP installment.

Samples of shellfish meats (40 clams per sample; n = 8 per collection) were collected at random from April 2009 through March 2010 in the bay area of Mangue Seco (state of Pernambuco). The numbers of thermotolerant coliforms were analyzed through the most probable number technique, and these contamination levels were tentatively correlated with the precipitation recorded on the day of sampling or 24 to 48 h beforehand. A. brasiliana shellfish meats from local retail shops (250 g per sample/ n = 3 per market) sold frozen were also investigated from August 2010 through June 2011. We found that the highest coliform contamination levels were correlated with recent rainfall events, limited to 24 h before sampling. However, irrespective of the rainfall level, the mean contamination above the Brazilian legal threshold of < 3 × 10(2) MPN/ 100 g for shellfish harvesting areas ranged from 18.7 to 93.7 % of samples analyzed monthly. Additionally, a large number of samples obtained from retail shops were also highly contaminated by coliforms during rainy periods, and therefore were not proper for human consumption.

In Donax clams, a surprisingly high level of esters has been recently associated with some outbreaks of diarrhoea in shellfish consumers. In view of these events, we have proposed that screening for esters must be included in monitoring programmes for DSP toxins. HPLC is laborious, time-consuming and suffers from some interferences at low detection levels in total meat extracts. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the procedure of Usagawa et al. ('DSP-Check' kit) was tested against HPLC. The 'DSP-Check' kit was capable of quantitatively detecting DSP toxins in all the tested contaminated samples containing only okadaic acid, provided that the parent toxins were within the range of detection and were not in the ester form. A high correlation was observed between the two methods when appropriate dilutions were performed. The immunoassay kit tested appeared to be more sensitive, specific and faster than HPLC for determination of DSP in total shellfish meat extracts. No problems were found when using hydrolysed semi-purified extracts in order to detect esters of okadaic acid. In view of the results obtained so far, Donax clams appeared to be an excellent indicator of shellfish contamination with diarrhoeic toxins. On sandy beaches of the Portuguese southern coast, were rock mussels are not so abundant, they should be screened more often than other species in order to prevent diarrhoea in humans."

In addition, genotoxicity and tumor-promoting properties of OA might constitute a long-term threat to human health. In order to deepen our understanding of the molecular effects of OA, we compared long-term (14 d) and short-term (24 h and 48 h) apoptotic effects of the compound on human HepaRG hepatocarcinoma cells. Cells were treated either with single doses for 24 and 48 h, respectively, or seven times over a period of 14 d, so that the cumulated quantities of OA in the long-term approach were equal to the single doses upon short-term treatment. Both short-term treatment scenarios led to the induction of apoptosis. Specific caspase activation assays and transcriptional analysis of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in the regulation of apoptosis suggest that OA-induced apoptosis occurs presumably by activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In contrast, effects were much less pronounced in case of long-term treatment. This is possibly linked to cellular protective mechanisms against low amounts of toxins, e. g. transporter-mediated efflux. In conclusion, our results show a clear concentration- and time-dependency of OA-mediated apoptotic effects in HepaRG cells and contribute to the elucidation of molecular effects of OA."

In general, TBT concentrations in various oysters ranging from 0.32 to 1.51 microg/g dry wt. varied with sampling locations. The highest TBT, Cu, and Zn geometric mean (GM) concentrations in oysters of 1.51, 1180 and 1567 microg/g dry wt. were obtained from the Hsiangshan coastal area. The values of oyster consumption for fishermen were 94.1 and 250 g/day for typically and maximally exposed individuals, respectively. In particular, the highest intake (250 g/day) from fishermen was almost two times greater than that of the general population (139 g/day). The THQ (target hazard quotient) values of Hsiangshan's fishermen are 3.87 and 20.50 for TBT and Cu for maximally exposed individuals are higher than other oyster culture areas. It is interesting that those consuming oysters from Hsiangshan, Lukang, Taishi caused abnormally high THQs of TBT and other metals (100% over 1.0), and TBT was attributed to only 3-21% of the total THQs in different fishermen of Taiwan.

Therefore, routine monitoring of LMATs in seawater of the coastal mariculture zone is necessary to prevent shellfish contamination especially in summer, and the proposed on-line SPE-LC-MS/MS method is a powerful way for direct and automatic detection of various LMATs in coastal mariculture area."

Marine toxins that affect safe shellfish harvest in the state are the saxitoxins that cause paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), domoic acid that causes amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) and the first ever US closure in 2011 due to diarrhetic shellfish toxins that cause diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP). Likewise, the freshwater toxins microcystins, anatoxin-a, cylindrospermopsins, and saxitoxins have been measured in state lakes, although cylindrospermopsins have not yet been measured above state regulatory guidance levels. This increased incidence of harmful algal blooms (HABs) has necessitated the partnering of state regulatory programs with citizen and user-fee sponsored monitoring efforts such as SoundToxins, the Olympic Region Harmful Algal Bloom (ORHAB) partnership and the state's freshwater harmful algal bloom passive (opportunistic) surveillance program that allow citizens to share their observations with scientists. Through such integrated programs that provide an effective interface between formalized state and federal programs and observations by the general public, county staff and trained citizen volunteers, the best possible early warning systems can be instituted for surveillance of known HABs, as well as for the reporting and diagnosis of unusual events that may impact the future health of oceans, lakes, wildlife, and humans."

The impact of HABs can potentially be mitigated by early warning of their development. In this regard the project ASIMUTH (Applied Simulations and Integrated Modelling for the Understanding of Toxic and Harmful algal blooms) was borne in order to develop short term HAB alert systems for Atlantic Europe. This was achieved using information on the most current marine conditions (weather, water characteristics, toxicity, harmful algal presence etc. ) combined with high resolution local numerical predictions. This integrated, multidisciplinary, trans-boundary approach to the study of HABs developed during ASIMUTH led to a better understanding of the physical, chemical and ecological factors controlling these blooms, as well as their impact on human activities. The outcome was an appropriate alert system for an effective management of areas that are usually associated with HAB events and where these episodes may have a more significant negative impact on human activities. Specifically for the aquaculture industry, the information provided enabled farmers to adapt their working practices in time to prevent mortalities in finfish farms and/or manage their shellfish harvest more effectively. This paper summarises the modelling and alert developments generated by the ASIMUTH project."

Practical Applications: Current Spanish legislation establishes that all bivalve mollusks intended for commercial sale and human consumption must be treated at a detoxification center. The application of detoxification is of fundamental importance because it constitutes a barrier against the transmission of bacterial and viral diseases of aquatic origin. We analyzed possible differences in contamination parameters in this type of shellfish, indicated characteristics that may be affected by alterations in quality, and discussed the potential effects of these alterations on human health."

PSP toxins are unique alkaloids, being produced by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we describe a candidate PSP toxin biosynthesis gene cluster (sxt) from Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii T3. The saxitoxin biosynthetic pathway is encoded by more than 35 kb, and comparative sequence analysis assigns 30 catalytic functions to 26 proteins. STX biosynthesis is initiated with arginine, S-adenosylmethionine, and acetate by a new type of polyketide synthase, which can putatively perform a methylation of acetate, and a Claisen condensation reaction between propionate and arginine. Further steps involve enzymes catalyzing three heterocyclizations and various tailoring reactions that result in the numerous isoforms of saxitoxin. In the absence of a gene transfer system in these microorganisms, we have revised the description of the known STX biosynthetic pathway, with in silico functional inferences based on sxt open reading frames combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the biosynthetic intermediates. Our results indicate the evolutionary origin for the production of PSP toxins in an ancestral cyanobacterium with genetic contributions from diverse phylogenetic lineages of bacteria and provide a quantum addition to the catalytic collective available for future combinatorial biosyntheses. The distribution of these genes also supports the idea of the involvement of this gene cluster in STX production in various cyanobacteria."

This procedure consists of an alkaline elution with a glycine buffer, solids removal by slow speed centrifugation, purification by chloroform extraction and virus concentration by ultracentrifugation. The efficiency of this method to recover Hepatitis A virus (HAV) from oysters seeded with this virus, was assessed by real-time RT-PCR and conventional RT-nested PCR after extracting viral RNA by a commercial isolation kit. Real-time RT-PCR yielded higher detection sensitivity than the obtained by conventional RT-nested PCR. Besides the improvements in detection sensitivity, the real-time RT-PCR, by quantifying HAV RNA, allowed to check the overall extraction procedure and the recovery efficiency after each processing step. After the last phase, i. e. virus concentration by ultracentrifugation, the RNA purity was high but the estimated HAV recovery efficiency was however low, probably due to virus losses and the presence of RT-PCR inhibitors in sample concentrates. In contrast, the HAV recovery percentage was higher after the virus elution step while the RNA purity was lower. Real-time RT-PCR detection could allow to eliminate some purification and concentration steps that are required for conventional RT-nested PCR detection. The overall procedure for detecting HAV could be then simplify avoiding virus losses during manipulation."

Strong non-specific binding and specific binding between NoVs and histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) present in shellfish tissues may explain why depuration is ineffective. Recent studies on NoV-binding patterns in shellfish have examined the attachment of NoV virus-like particles (VLPs) to HBGAs present in shellfish using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). As NoVs are genetically diverse, it is not practical to produce a range of VLPs and specific antibodies for binding studies. Tank-based bioaccumulation experiments for binding studies also require laboratory space and time. The aim of this study was to develop an alternative method to determine binding patterns for a range of shellfish species and NoV genotypes without using VLPs, antibodies, or tanks. Pacific oysters, green-lipped mussels, two GI and four GII NoV genotypes were selected for assay development. Shellfish gut homogenates were coated onto microwell plates, then purified NoV suspensions were added to each well. Blocking and wash steps using similar reagents as used in ELISAs were carried out. RNA was extracted directly in each well, then RNA copies were quantified by RT-qPCR. Diluent buffer-coated wells spiked with NoVs were used as controls. Different binding patterns were observed. NoV binding was always higher with oysters than with mussels. The highest NoV binding was found with GI.3 and oysters, with 97 % NoV GI.3 bound to oyster homogenate compared with 5 % bound to mussel homogenate. GI.4 did not bind to mussels."

Yet, the potential interactions between abiotic stressors and HABs are still poorly understood from ecological and seafood safety perspectives. The present study aimed to investigate, for the first time, the bioaccumulation/depuration mechanisms and ecotoxicological responses of juvenile gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) exposed to paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) under different temperatures (18, 21, 24 °C). PST were detected in fish at the peak of the exposure period (day five, 0.22 µg g-1 N-sulfocarbamoylGonyautoxin-1-2 (C1 and C2), 0.08 µg g-1 Decarbamoylsaxitoxin (dcSTX) and 0.18 µg g-1 Gonyautoxin-5 (B1)), being rapidly eliminated (within the first 24 h of depuration), regardless of exposure temperature. Increased temperatures led to significantly higher PST contamination (275 µg STX eq. kg-1). During the trial, fish antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, SOD; catalase, CAT; glutathione S-transferase, GST) in both muscle and viscera were affected by temperature, whereas a significant induction of heat shock proteins (HSP70), Ubiquitin (Ub) activity (viscera), and lipid peroxidation (LPO; muscle) was observed under the combination of warming and PST exposure. The differential bioaccumulation and biomarker responses observed highlight the need to further understand the interactive effects between PST and abiotic stressors, to better estimate climate change impacts on HABs events, and to develop mitigation strategies to overcome the potential risks associated with seafood consumption."

V. parahaemolyticus and Vibrio alginolyticus have previously been detected in water samples from the Oosterschelde, a large inlet on the North Sea, which is used for both recreational purposes and shellfish production. In 2006, oysters (Crassostrea gigas) from a noncommercial oyster bed in the Oosterschelde and oysters bought in Dutch fish shops were tested for the presence of pathogenic Vibrio species; in 2007 and 2008, oysters (C. gigas) and mussels (Mytilus edulis) from Oosterschelde production areas were examined. Total Vibrio numbers were related to water temperatures to study joint patterns. Vibrio was found in oysters and mussels from the production areas, and levels ranged from 6 to 622 most probable number (MPN) per g in oysters and 6 to 62 MPN/g in mussels. Vibrio levels in oysters from fish shops were 231 to >333 MPN/g, whereas levels in noncommercial oysters ranged from 231 to >2,398 MPN/g. About 80% of the isolated strains were V. alginolyticus, and approximately 10% were identified as V. parahaemolyticus. Vibrio counts in shellfish samples increased with increasing water temperature and declined when water temperatures dropped; Vibrio was not detected when water temperatures declined to <13.5 degrees C. Based on the obtained results and the known high V. parahaemolyticus dose (>10(4) cells per serving of oysters) required for infection, it is concluded that the risk of gastrointestinal infections with V. parahaemolyticus through consumption of shellfish from the Oosterschelde production sites is presumably low."

The sampled food webs included zooplankton, benthic macroinvertebrates, shellfish, and finfish species. Zooplankton, benthic macroinvertebrates, and shellfish occupied the lowest trophic levels (TL ≈2 to 3); northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) occupied the middle trophic levels (TL ≈3 to 4), and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) occupied the highest tropic level (TL>4.0). Trophic dynamics in the Oslofjord were best described as a compressed food web defined by demersal and pelagic components that were confounded by a diversity in prey organisms and feeding relationships. Lipid-normalized concentrations of D4, D5, and D6 were greatest in the lowest trophic levels and significantly decreased up the food web, with the lowest concentrations being observed in the highest trophic level species. Trophic magnification factors (TMF) for D4, D5, and D6 were <1.0 (range 0.3 to 0.9) and were consistent between the Inner and Outer Oslofjord, indicating that exposure did not impact TMF across the marine food web. There was no evidence to suggest biomagnification of cVMS in the Oslofjord. Rather, results indicated that trophic dilution of cVMS, not trophic magnification, occurred across the sampled food webs."

Recent research has reinforced concerns about adverse effects of methylmercury exposure, suggesting that methylmercury doses associated with typical US rates of fish consumption may pose measurable risks, with no threshold. These converging trends create a need to improve risk communication about fish consumption and mercury. The analysis performed here identifies the relative importance of different fish and shellfish as sources of mercury in the US seafood supply and proposes improved consumer advice, so that the public can benefit from fish consumption while minimizing mercury exposure. I have quantified contributions to total mercury in the US seafood supply by 51 different varieties of fish and shellfish, then ranked and sorted the 51 varieties in terms of relative impact. Except for swordfish, most fish with the highest mercury levels are relatively minor contributors to total inputs. Tuna (canned light, canned albacore and fresh/frozen varieties) accounts for 37.4 percent of total mercury inputs, while two-thirds of the seafood supply and nine of the 11 most heavily consumed fish and shellfish are low or very low in mercury. Substantial improvement in risk communication about mercury in fish and seafood is needed; in particular, several population subsets need better guidance to base their seafood choices more explicitly on mercury content. I have sorted the 51 seafood varieties into six categories based on mercury levels, as a framework for improving risk communication in this regard."

Thus, there is a need for regulatory agencies entrusted with food safety to develop adequate techniques for the detection of viruses in foods. We have established a general procedure for the detection of hepatitis A virus (HAV) in shellfish that, with minor modifications, is also applicable to fresh produce such as cilantro. Total RNA was isolated from shellfish or cilantro, followed by isolation of poly(A)-containing RNA. Because HAV genomic RNA contains a poly(A) tail, the isolation of poly(A)-containing RNA also enriches HAV genomic RNA. Reverse transcription was used to convert the RNA to cDNA, and then amplification was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Reamplification with internal primers was used to improve the quality and the quantity of amplified DNA, allowing for post-PCR analysis such as sequence identification of the viral strain. With this procedure, multiple samples could be analyzed in four working days by a single trained individual. The nominal sensitivity of detection of the procedure was 0.15 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) per 0.62 g of tissue with a test virus. The direct RNA isolation protocol avoided pitfalls associated with whole-virus purification procedures by replacing virus precipitation steps involving polyethylene glycol and Procipitate with phenol extraction. The method is straightforward and reliable. We successfully used this procedure to detect naturally occurring HAV in clams involved in a gastroenteritis outbreak, as well as in cilantro artificially contaminated with a test virus."

The intensification of shellfish aquaculture to maximize production rate has led to increased generation of aquaculture waste streams, particularly the effluents and shellfish wastes. If not effectively managed, these wastes could pose serious threats to human health and the ecosystem while compromising the overall sustainability of the industry. The present work comprehensively reviews the source, composition, and environmental implications of shellfish wastes and aquaculture wastewater. Moreover, recent advancements in the valorization of shellfish wastes into value-added biochar via emerging thermochemical and modification techniques are scrutinized. The utilization of the produced biochar in removing emerging pollutants from aquaculture wastewater is also discussed. It was revealed that shellfish waste-derived biochar exhibits relatively higher adsorption capacities (300-1500 mg/g) compared to lignocellulose biochar (<200 mg/g). The shellfish waste-derived biochar can be effectively employed for the removal of various contaminants such as antibiotics, heavy metals, and excessive nutrients from aquaculture wastewater. Finally, future research priorities and challenges faced to improve the sustainability of the shellfish aquaculture industry to effectively support global food security are elaborated. This review envisages that future studies should focus on the biorefinery concept to extract more useful compounds (e. g. , carotenoid, chitin) from shellfish wastes for promoting environmental-friendly aquaculture."

It is, therefore, an urgent need to assess the levels of PCBs in seafood. A comprehensive congener-specific evaluation of PCBs was carried out for the first time in Bangladesh. All 209 congeners of PCBs in 48 seafood samples (5 finfish and 2 shellfish species) collected in winter and summer of 2015 were measured by GC-MS/MS. Regardless of season and site, the ∑PCBs (ng/g wet weight) in finfish and shellfish were in the range of 6.4-86.2 and 3.8-37.7, respectively. The results were comparable to or higher than those observed in other studies worldwide, particularly from Spain, China, Korea, Thailand, and Hong Kong. No significant seasonal variation was observed in the levels of ∑PCBs in the examined seafood (p > 0.05); however, interspecies differences were significant (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, spatial distribution revealed seafood collected from the areas with recent urbanization and industrialization (Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, and Sundarbans) were more contaminated with PCBs than the area unaffected by industries (Meghna Estuary). Moderately chlorinated (4-6 Cl) homologs dominated the PCB profiles. The congener profile and homolog composition revealed that the source origin of PCBs in the Bangladeshi seafood was related to mixtures of technical PCBs formulations. The dietary exposure assessment revealed that the coastal residents are sufficiently exposed to the dietary PCBs through seafood consumption which may cause severe health risk including dioxin-like toxic effects."

No significant differences in the bioaccumulation of bacteria and bacteriophages for oysters or mussels were observed. It was found that the probability of detection of any of the pathogenic virus decreases as the temperature of shellfish growing waters increases.

Due to their high prevalence in dairy and beef cattle, farms are considered to be potential sources of transmission of the parasites to surrounding bodies of water. Additionally, human sewage overflow events can also contaminate nearby water sources. Both protozoa have been detected in various species of shellfish, but a lack of consistency in methods for detection and viability assessments make it difficult to compare data and extrapolate results. Nonetheless, the detection of these parasites in shellfish destined for human consumption is necessary due to the public health risk that these parasites pose. There is currently no legislation requiring public health officials to test for these parasites in potentially contaminated shellfish or water, despite the increasing evidence suggesting the need to implement parasitological analyses. Furthermore, standard depuration procedures are ineffective at inactivating the parasites, and even supplementation with ultraviolet radiation requires extensive periods of depuration to effectively inactivate all (oo)cysts from bivalves. Although there have been no official reports of human gastroenteritis acquired from consuming shellfish contaminated with Cryptosporidium sp. and/or G. duodenalis, studies examining the efficacy of current monitoring and depuration standards in Canada are needed in the event that they are inadequate for the removal of potentially harmful protozoan parasites."

The effects of AZA-2 on rat electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac biomarkers were evaluated for cardiotoxicity signs besides corroborating the hERG-blocking activity of AZA-2. Our results demonstrated that AZA-2 does not induce QT interval prolongation on rat ECGs in vivo, in spite of being an in vitro blocker of the hERG cardiac potassium channel. However, AZA-2 alters the heart electrical activity causing prolongation of PR intervals and the appearance of arrhythmias. More studies will be needed to clarify the mechanism by which AZA-2 causes these ECG alterations; however, the potential cardiotoxicity of AZAs demonstrated in this in vivo study should be taken into consideration when evaluating the possible threat that these toxins pose to human health, mainly for individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular disease when regulated toxin limits are exceeded."

Azaspiracids have been related to widespread organ damage, tumorogenic properties and acute heart rhythm alterations in vivo but the mechanism of action remains unknown. Azaspiracid toxicity kinetics in vivo and in vitro suggests accumulative effects. We studied subacute cardiotoxicity in vivo after repeated exposure to AZA-1 by evaluation of the ECG, arterial blood pressure, plasmatic heart damage biomarkers, and myocardium structure and ultrastructure. Our results showed that four administrations of AZA-1 along 15 days caused functional signs of heart failure and structural heart alterations in rats at doses ranging from 1 to 55 µg/kg. Azaspiracid-1 altered arterial blood pressure, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 plasma levels, heart collagen deposition, and ultrastructure of the myocardium. Overall, these data indicate that repeated exposure to low amounts of AZA-1 causes cardiotoxicity, at doses that do not induce signs of other organic system toxicity. Remarkably, human exposure to AZAs considering current regulatory limits of these toxins may be dangerously close to clearly cardiotoxic doses in rats. These findings should be considered when human risk is estimated particularly in high cardiovascular risk subpopulations."

For this purpose, we collected blood samples from a general population in Siheung, Korea and measured for 13 PFCs, total thyroxine (T4), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). In addition, a questionnaire survey on diet was conducted. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) were detected in relatively greater concentrations than the other 9 PFCs in the blood serum. Males tend to have greater concentrations than females for most PFCs, and the concentrations were elevated as age increased up to 50s. Body mass index (BMI) was also shown to influence the serum concentrations of several PFCs. After adjustment for age, sex, and BMI, the consumption of vegetable, potato, fish/shellfish, and popcorn was identified to be significantly related with concentrations of major PFCs in blood. Among the studied PFCs, the concentrations of perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA) were negatively correlated with total T4, and positively with TSH levels, especially among females. The result of this study will provide information useful for developing public health and safety management measures for PFCs."

In this study, the common harmful algal blooms-causing dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense was exposed to 0.1 and 1 μm sized polystyrene nanoplastics (NPs) to investigate the responding patterns of population growth, multiple physiological functions, as well as the intracellular paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) productions. The results indicated the population growth, photosynthetic parameters, nutrients (nitrate and phosphate) uptake rates and extracellular carbonic anhydrase activities (CAext) were all inhibited by the two sized NPs, accompanied by the prolonged and more aggregated microalgal cells under the observation of scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the inhibition effects were more severe under 1 μm sized NPs than 0.1 μm sized NPs. Finally, we found the intracellular PSTs contents increased 73.59% exposed to 0.1 μm sized NPs while decreased 85.50% exposed to 1 μm sized NPs comparing the controls at 96 h, without significant changes of relative compositions. These results provided evidence that MNPs were toxic to A. tamarense and affected their intracellular PSTs productions within 96 h, which is critical to consider when evaluating the potential risks of MNPs in marine ecosystems."

Additionally, to determine and compare the relative MP levels in edible versus non-edible tissues, and consider the wider implications in terms of human health concerns with a preliminary risk identification approach. For several fish species, samples taken from typically non-edible (gills, digestive system) and edible (muscle) flesh, and were analysed separately. Scallops, where all tissues are edible, were analysed whole. Significant differences were observed in the number of particles isolated from the finfish gills and digestive tissues relative to the control samples, but not in the edible flesh. For scallops, the abundance of particles in the Scottish samples did not vary significantly from the control, while the Patagonian scallops displayed significantly higher numbers of MPs. Characterisation of MPs by FTIR microscopy found that 16-60% (depending on species) were polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene (PE) in origin. The risk identification results validate MPs as an emerging risk in the food chain and establish seafood as a vector for the exposure and uptake of MPs through the ingestion route for humans.

Efforts are now underway in several laboratories to better define the effects and mechanism(s) of action for the AZAs. Our investigations have employed Jurkat T lymphocyte cells as an in vitro model to characterize the toxicological effects of AZA1, AZA2, and AZA3. Cytotoxicity experiments employing a metabolically based dye (i. e. , MTS) indicated that AZA1, AZA2, and AZA3 each elicited a lethal response that was both concentration- and time-dependent, with EC(50) values in the sub- to low nanomolar range. On the basis of EC(50) comparisons, the order of potency was as follows: AZA2 > AZA3 > AZA1, with toxic equivalence factors (TEFs) relative to AZA1 of 8.3-fold and 4.5-fold greater for AZA2 and AZA3, respectively. Image analysis of exposed cells using Nomarski differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging and fluorescent imaging of cellular actin indicated that the morphological effects of AZA1 on this cell type are unique relative to the effects of AZA2 and AZA3.

Fast development of aquaculture and increasing fish demand lead to intensification of fish culture, magnifying stressors for fish and thus heightening the risk of disease. Until now, chemotherapy has been widely used to prevent and treat disease outbreaks, although use of chemical drugs has multiple negative impacts on environment and human health e. g. resistant bacterial strains and residual accumulation in tissue. Hence, disease management in aquaculture should concentrate on environmentally friendly and lasting methods. Recently, increasing attention is being paid to the use of plant products for disease control in aquaculture as an alternative to chemical treatments. Plant products have been reported to stimulate appetite and promote weight gain, to act as immunostimulant and to have antibacterial and anti-parasitic (virus, protozoans, monogeneans) properties in fish and shellfish aquaculture due to active molecules such as alkaloids, terpenoids, saponins and flavonoids. However, as it is a relatively emerging practice there is still little knowledge on the long-term effects of plant extracts on fish physiology as well as a lack of homogenization in the extract preparation and fish administration of the plant extracts. This article aims to review the studies carried out on the use of plant products on fish aquaculture and their biological effects on fish such as growth promoter, immunostimulant, antibacterial and anti-parasitic. It also intends to evaluate the current state of the art, the methods used and the problems encountered in their application to the aquaculture industry."

Currently, they are not regulated due to the lack of toxicological comprehensive data and hence the European Food Safety Authority has required more scientific efforts before establishing a maximum permitted level in seafood. In this work, a novel data dependent liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) approach has been successfully applied and combined with targeted studies for an in-depth investigation of the metabolic profile of shellfish samples. The proposed analytical methodology has allowed: i) to discover a plethora of unknown fatty acid esters of gymnodimines and ii) to conceive a brand new MS-based strategy, termed as backward analysis, for discovery and identification of new analogues. In particular, the implemented analytical workflow has broadened the structural diversity of cyclic imine family through the inclusion of five new congeners, namely gymnodimine -F, -G, -H, -I and -J.

Abalone were exposed to either live Alexandrium catenella microalgal cultures or PST contaminated feed pellets during a 28 day exposure period and toxins quantified in viscera, foot muscle and epipodium tissues. PST profiles of abalone foot tissues were dominated by saxitoxin and neosaxitoxin, whilst viscera more closely resembled those of the toxin source (A. catenella cells rich in gonyautoxin 1&4 and 2&3 or feed pellets containing A. catenella extracts rich in these analogues). This indicates direct uptake of PST in the viscera via browsing/grazing on the pellet and /or sedimented microalgal cells. After exposure to A. catenella cell culture, PST concentrations in the foot (muscle + epipodium) were on average 8 times higher than in the viscera. Higher toxicity of foot tissue was caused by higher PST content of the epipodium (up to 1,085 µg STX.2HCl equiv. kg-1), which despite its small contribution to total animal weight significantly added to the overall toxin burden. Higher PST levels in the abalone foot suggest that toxin monitoring programmes may not need to routinely analyse both foot and viscera, potentially allowing for a 50% reduction of analytical costs.

Two hundred and ninety samples of mussels from different sources were collected between December 1999 and January 2000. One hundred samples were collected before being subjected to depuration, 90 after depuration, and 100 were sampled in different seafood markets. HAV-RNA was detected in 20 (20.0%) of non-depurated mussels, in 10 (11.1%) of depurated samples, and in 23 (23.0%) of samples collected in the shellfish markets, without any significant difference in the prevalence of positive samples by collection sources (chi2 = 4.79, p = 0.09). Of the 53 samples found positive by nested RT-PCR, 18 (34.0%) resulted positive by cell culture assay. No relationship between viral contamination and bacterial contamination was found (p = 0.41).

The recent application by the European Community of a 1 microg Cd/g (wet weight) import limit to bivalve molluscs and the current deliberation by CODEX to adopt the same value, pose significant threats to the shellfish export trade in the Pacific Northwest (British Columbia, Washington and Alaska), where natural oceanographic conditions and coastal geology contribute to levels of Cd that usually exceed the 1 ppm limit. Human health aspects of chronic Cd exposure comprise an active field of study (this Symposium) and the validity of existing Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake is being questioned. Bioavailability of Cd from the oyster and scallop matrix is unknown and requires study. Ramifications of this uncertainty may include damage to public perception of the safety of the cultured shellfish product, loss of export market and general undermining of an industry being encouraged by both the Province of British Columbia and Federal aquaculture initiatives. There is therefore a pressing need to redefine what the ""safe"" limit of lifetime Cd intake is from all sources, and determine bioavailability, specifically from bivalve molluscs. Such information would facilitate the definition of scientifically defensible Cd limits by CODEX."

Lake Catemaco (Veracruz, Mexico) is a small, tropical lake system specifically characterized by a year-round dominance of the known toxigenic cyanobacterial genus, Cylindrospermopsis, and by low, but detectable, levels of both a cyanobacterial hepatotoxin, cylindrospermopsin (CYN), and paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs). In the present study, we evaluated, using enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), levels of both toxins in several species of finfish caught and consumed locally in the region to investigate the bioaccumulation of, and possible health threats associated with, these toxins as potential foodborne contaminants. ELISA detected levels of both CYN and PSTs in fish tissues from the lake. Levels were generally low (≤ 1 ng g(-1) tissue); however, calculated bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) indicate that toxin levels exceed the rather low levels in the water column and, consequently, indicated bioaccumulation (BAF >1). A reasonable correlation was observed between measured bioaccumulation of CYN and PSTs, possibly indicating a mutual source of both toxins, and most likely cells of Cylindrospermopsis, the dominant cyanobacteria in the lake, and a known producer of both metabolites. The potential roles of trophic transport in the system, as well as possible implications for human health with regards to bioaccumulation, are discussed."

Simulations were based on bacterial transport and survival coupled models forced by the input of bacterial loads from the two main rivers (Vène and Pallas) that flow into the lagoon. Different flow types (reference, sudden and constant), bringing the same bacterial load, were considered and subsequent spatial and temporal bacterial contamination of lagoon surface water and shellfish was estimated. Simulation results showed that as long as loads were high, hydrodynamical processes governed the distribution of bacterial abundance in receiving areas. As soon as loads decreased or when time supply increased, biological die-off processes became dominant. Bacterial contamination of shellfish induced by the different flow types appeared to depend on the receiving area. In the case of Pallas River area, a sudden input of bacteria led to a high bacterial contamination of shellfish but only during a short period ( approximately 1 day). A constant input of the same amount of bacteria induced a lower but significant contamination during all the simulation period (10 days). On the contrary, bacterial inputs from the Vène River led to shellfish contamination only when bacteria were delivered through a flood event. Exposure time of bacteria to adverse environmental conditions appeared to be the main explanation to the above-mentioned differences.

These harmful species may threaten shellfish harvest and human health due to their ability to synthesize neurotoxic alkaloids of the saxitoxin group. However, some dinoflagellates such as A. minutum, and as reported here A. pacificum as well, may also have a beneficial impact on the environment by producing dimethylsulfoniopropionate-DMSP, the precursor of dimethylsulfur-DMS and sulfate aerosols involved in climate balance. However, environmental conditions might influence Alexandrium physiology towards the production of harmful or environmentally friendly compounds. After assessing the influence of two salinity regimes (33 and 38) relative to each species origin (Atlantic French coast and Mediterranean Lagoon respectively), it appears that DMSP and toxin content was variable between the three experimented strains and that higher salinity disadvantages toxin production and tends to favor the production of the osmolytes DMSP and glycine betaine. Hence, this key metabolite production is strain and species-dependent and is influenced by environmental conditions of salinity which in turn, can diversely affect the environment. Widespread coastal blooms of A. minutum and A. pacificum, although being a risk for seafood contamination with toxins, are also a DMSP and DMS source that potentially contribute to the ecosystem structuration and climate. Regarding recent advances in DMSP biosynthesis pathway, 3 dsyB homologs were found in A. minutum but no homolog of the diatom sequence TpMMT."

The intake of PFCs through both pathways, drinking water intake and fish and shellfish consumption, was also estimated. In water samples, the highest mean concentrations corresponded to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) (1.81 and 2.40 ng/L, respectively), whereas perfluorodecanosulfonate (PFDS) and perfluorotetradecanoic acid (PFTDA) were under their respective limits of detection in all analyzed samples. The results show that although the current treatment processes caused slight reductions in PFC concentrations, these processes did not mean significant changes in the amounts of PFCs already contained in the raw water. Among the analyzed PFCs in fish and shellfish, only seven compounds could be detected in at least one composite sample. PFOS showed the highest mean concentration (2.70 ng/g fw), being detected in all species with the exception of mussels. With regard to PFOA (mean, 0.074 ng/g fw), the highest concentrations were detected in prawn and hake (0.098 and 0.091 ng/g fw, respectively).

Additionally, gene expression was studied after exposure of toxic A. circinalis cultures to lidocaine hydrochloride at 1 microM for 2 h. Under standard growth conditions, a limited number of putative toxic-strain distinctive DNA fragments, identified in previous studies, were preferentially expressed in toxic versus non-toxic strains. The same genes did not significantly change their expression after exposure to 1 microM lidocaine, conditions previously shown to induce STX production in the cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii T3. Lidocaine supplementation, however, enhanced the transcription of genes involved in physiological adaptive responses and bloom formation in cyanobacteria, such as the gas vesicle structural protein A and phycocyanin. The heat shock protein HSP-70 and the chlorophyll-a binding protein isiA were significantly repressed by lidocaine exposure. Stress response proteins and genes implicated in secondary metabolism were repressed, including phosphopantetheinyl transferases.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of trace elements in adult specimens of indigenous clams (Ruditapes decussatus). To this end, wild clams were collected from four different brackish areas of Sardinia (Western Mediterranean Sea, Italy) devoted to extensive aquacultural practices. The concentration of 16 trace elements (Al, Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Sn, Tl and Zn) in the tissues of the clams was quantified.

However, unexpectedly high values for aluminium and iron (mean 207 mg kg⁻1 and 113 mg kg⁻1 wet weight) were found in Santa Gilla lagoon, which is close to industrial settlements and had the highest values for the majority of chemical elements investigated. The highest values of the metalloid arsenic (As) were reported in the Porto Pozzo and San Teodoro lagoons (9.6 and 6.8 mg kg⁻1 w. w. , respectively).

So, it is important and highly essential to develop novel techniques for STX detection in a convenient, desirable, and low-cost manner. Herein, this study developed an electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor (EIS) sensor covered with a layer-by-layer prepared, positively-charged weak polyelectrolyte layer of poly (allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) for the label-free detection of STX. The specific aptamer (Apt) sensitive to STX was electrostatically adsorbed onto the PAH layer. This leads to a preferentially flat orientation of the Apt within the Debye length, thus yielding a reduced charge-screening influence and a higher sensor signal. Each step of sensor surface modification, i. e. PAH adsorption, immobilization of Apt, and attachment of STX, was monitored by capacitance-voltage (C-V) and constant-capacitance (ConCap) measurements. Furthermore, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to characterize the surface morphology and roughness of the PAH layer. Fluorescence microscopy was used to confirm the effective immobilization of Apt onto the PAH-modified EIS sensor. The results showed that the detection range of this aptasensor for STX detection was 0.5-100 nM and the detection limit was as low as 0.05 nM. Furthermore, this aptasensor showed good selectivity and 9 days' stability. The mussel tissue extraction test suggested that this aptasensor can be used to detect STX in real samples. This aptasensor provides a convenient approach for moderate, rapid, and label-free detection of marine biological toxins."

Overall, E. coli and presumptive STEC isolates (from CHROMagar) were identified from the surface (55.6 and 5.9%) and tissues (42.2 and 8.9%) of the examined shellfish batches, respectively. Five STEC isolates had been confirmed and found belonging to O26:H11, O125:H6, O146:H21, and O159 serogroups, those were 4 isolates from tissues of the three shellfish species and one isolate from the crab surface. The STEC isolates were multi-drug resistant, showing complete resistance to; penicillins, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, colistin, fosfomycin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline, however, they were sensitive to gentamycin except O159 serogroup.

Rapid and accurate identification of Vibrio species has been problematic because phenotypic characteristics are variable within species. Additionally, biochemical identification and confirmation require 2 or more days to complete. Rapid and sensitive molecular techniques for the detection of vibrio pathogens would be useful for the surveillance and management of outbreaks. To facilitate the identification of human-pathogenic species, we designed and validated a highly sensitive, specific, and robust multiplex real-time PCR assay to identify V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus using a four-dye configuration in a convenient lyophilized format. Multiple Vibrio strains were sequenced to verify candidate target TaqMan sites. Several individual assays within the multiplex contain multiple primers or probes to ensure detection of polymorphic variants. V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus were detected either individually or in mixtures at ≤30 genomic copies. V. cholerae was specifically detected in the presence or absence of Vibrio mimicus. The Vibrio multiplex assay showed 100% specificity to all targets analyzed and no detection of nearest neighbor strains. Each assay exhibited 100% ± 10% efficiency. Multiplex real-time PCR can simplify pathogen detection and reduce costs per test since three species can be analyzed in a single reaction tube. Rapid and accurate detection of pathogenic vibrios in shellfish or seawater samples will improve the microbiological safety of seafood for consumers."

They accumulate in filtering shellfish and can cause human intoxications. Humans can be exposed to combinations of several phycotoxins. The toxicological effects of phycotoxin mixtures on human health are largely unknown. Published data on phycotoxin co-exposure show that okadaic acid (OA) is simultaneously found with pectenetoxin-2 (PTX-2), 13-desmethylspirolide C (also known as SPX-1), or yessotoxin (YTX). Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of three binary mixtures, OA/PTX-2, OA/SPX-1 and OA/YTX on human intestinal Caco-2 cells. A multi-parametric approach for cytotoxicity determination was applied using a high-content analysis platform, including markers for cell viability, oxidative stress, inflammation, and DNA damage. Mixtures effects were analyzed using two additivity mathematical models. Our assays revealed that OA induced cytotoxicity, DNA strand breaks and interleukin 8 release. PTX-2 slightly induced DNA strand breaks, whereas SPX-1 and YTX did not affect the investigated endpoints. The combination of OA with another toxin resulted in reduced toxicity at low concentrations, suggesting antagonistic effects, but in increased effects at higher concentrations, suggesting additive or synergistic effects. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the cytotoxic effects of binary mixtures of lipophilic phycotoxins could not be predicted by additivity mathematical models. In conclusion, the present data suggest that combined effects of phycotoxins may occur which might have the potential to impact on risk assessment of these compounds."

Marinated mussels are a popular delicacy, but there is no published information on whether enteric viruses survive the marination process. The survival and persistence of HAV, NV, and a surrogate calicivirus, feline calicivirus (FCV), in marinated mussels over time was determined. NV, HAV, and FCV were inoculated into marinated mussels and marinade liquid and then held at 4 degrees C for up to 4 weeks. Survival of HAV and FCV was quantified by determining the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50), and these results were correlated with those of the reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay. The persistence of nonculturable NV was determined by RT-PCR assay only. Over 4 weeks, HAV survived exposure to acid marinade at pH 3.75. There was a 1.7-log reduction in HAV TCID50 titer but no reduction in NV or HAV RT-PCR titer after 4 weeks in marinated mussels. FCV was inactivated in acid conditions although it was still detectable by RT-PCR. To simulate preharvest virus contamination and commercial marination processing, experiments using fresh mussels infected with HAV and NV were performed. HAV and NV persistence was determined using semiquantitative real-time RT-PCR, and HAV infectivity was determined by the TCID50 assay. HAV retained infectivity following simulated commercial marination and exposure to acid conditions over 4 weeks. The survival of pathogenic enteric viruses in marinated mussels constitutes a potential health risk and so is of concern to public health authorities."

Although shellfish are generally safe for consumption, their exposure to diverse habitats, the filter feeding nature of shellfish such as oysters, clams, and mussels, and unhealthy farming and handling practices may occasionally entail health risks because of possible presence of various hazards. These hazards include pathogenic organisms, parasites, biotoxins, industrial and environmental pollutants, heavy metals, process-related additives such as antibiotics and bisulfite, and also presence of allergy-causing compounds in their bodies. Most of the hazards can be addressed by appropriate preventive measures at various stages of harvesting, farming, processing, storage, distribution, and consumption. Furthermore, consumer safety of shellfish and other seafood items is strictly monitored by international, governmental, and local public health organizations. This article highlights the nutritional value and health benefits of shellfish items and points out the various control measures to safeguard consumer safety with respect to the products."

This includes microbiological samples for detection of fecal coliform bacteria in marine and freshwater systems which are a critical component of food safety programs for human consumption of bivalve shellfish worldwide. Water sample collection programs are typically vessel-based which can be time and resource intensive. In Canada, the Canadian Shellfish Sanitation Program aims to avoid consumption of contaminated molluscan bivalves by monitoring fecal coliform bacteria through vessel-based water sample collection. Uncrewed aerial vehicles or drones are becoming more commonly used for water sample collection given their relatively low cost but are rarely used to support microbiological analyses. A prerequisite for the acceptance of a new collection method for a regulatory program is to determine if the method of sample collection affects results. To assess this potential, we designed, developed, and tested a sampling device attached to the underside of a drone to collect water samples for bacteriological analysis. Drone and vessel-based samples were collected in the same location, at the same 20-cm depth, within a minute apart, at ten different geographic locations in coastal Nova Scotia waters to compare fecal coliform counts. Bacterial count estimates obtained from drone-collected samples were not significantly different than estimates obtained from vessel-collected samples (p < 0.5). Results from this study suggest novel water sampling techniques using drones could supplement or replace traditional vessel-based sampling methods."

The current study was undertaken to build upon the already established body of knowledge surrounding effects of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis on shellfish, to provide an understanding of the kinetics of brevetoxins within shellfish tissues, and to provide an estimate of brevetoxin retention times in these shellfish after a bloom event. Individual clams and oysters were exposed to the toxic dinoflagellate, K. brevis at a bloom concentration of 5 × 10(5) cells·L(-1) for eight days and then transferred to filtered water for depuration. Individuals were sampled periodically to determine depuration rates. Concentrations of brevetoxins (and/or their metabolites measured as PbTx-3 equivalent) in tissues were determined using an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). After five days of exposure, brevetoxin levels in tissues of both species reached concentrations well above the regulatory limit of 800 ng g(-1) (Pb-TX3 equivalent). Averaged concentration of brevetoxins in clams was 1000 ng g(-1), while the oysters averaged 1986 ng g(-1). After two weeks of depuration, tissue concentrations in both species were below regulatory levels with clams averaging ~204 ng g(-1) and oysters averaging ~437 ng g(-1).

Accumulation of phycotoxins from HAB phytoplankton in filter-feeding shellfish can poison human consumers, prompting harvesting closures at shellfish production sites. To quantify long-term intoxication risk from Dinophysis HAB species, we used historical HAB monitoring data (2009-2020) to develop a new modelling approach to predict Dinophysis toxin concentrations in a range of bivalve shellfish species at shellfish sites in Western Scotland, South-West England and Northern France. A spatiotemporal statistical modelling framework was developed within the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) framework to quantify long-term HAB risks for different bivalve shellfish species across each region, capturing seasonal variations, and spatiotemporal interactions. In all regions spatial functions were most important for predicting seasonal HAB risk, offering the potential to inform optimal siting of new shellfish operations and safe harvesting periods for businesses. A 10-fold cross-validation experiment was carried out for each region, to test the models' ability to predict toxin risk at harvesting locations for which data were withheld from the model. Performance was assessed by comparing ranked predicted and observed mean toxin levels at each site within each region: the correlation of ranks was 0.78 for Northern France, 0.64 for Western Scotland, and 0.34 for South-West England, indicating our approach has promise for predicting unknown HAB risk, depending on the region and suitability of training data."

Validated analytical methodology was developed to investigate the occurrence of hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD), pentachlorobenzene (PCBz), hexachlorobenzene (HCB) pentachlorophenol (PCP) and polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) in 120 retail foods and 19 total diet study samples. The foods covered the range of commonly consumed dietary items including dairy products, eggs (hen and other species), poultry, meat, fish, vegetables, etc. HCBD showed a low frequency of detection, whereas PCBz, HCB and PCNs occurred in most samples (ranges: <0.01 to 0.19 μg/kg; <0.01 to 3.16 μg/kg and 0.1 to 166 ng ΣPCNs/kg respectively). PCP (<0.01 to 1.9 μg/kg) was detected more frequently in meat products, offal and eggs. Fish, shellfish, eggs from all species, animal fats, meat, offal and meat products showed higher contamination levels, which is normal when investigating lipophilic POPs. These levels of occurrence are similar to more recently reported literature levels but perhaps lower, relative to historic data. This is not unexpected, given the restrictions/limitations on these chemicals within the UK and Western Europe. The estimated human exposure to population groups through dietary intake is correspondingly low and based on current toxicological knowledge, the levels in the examined samples do not suggest a cause for health concern. The data also provide a current baseline for HCBD, PCBz and PCP, and update existing data for PCN and HCB occurrence in foods."

Data from 1,260 pregnant and 5,848 non-pregnant women aged 16-49 years from the 1999 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed. Frequency and type of seafood consumed and adjusted associations of multiple characteristics with seafood consumption were estimated for pregnant and non-pregnant women, separately. Time trends were also examined. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of fish or shellfish consumption, separately or combined, between pregnant and non-pregnant women using either the 30-day questionnaire or the Day 1, 24-h recall. Seafood consumption was associated with higher age, income, and education among pregnant and non-pregnant women, and among fish consumers these groups were more likely to consume ≥3 servings in the past 30 days. Tuna and shrimp were the most frequently reported fish and shellfish, respectively, among both pregnant and non-pregnant women. We observed no significant time trends. There were no differences in seafood consumption between pregnant and non-pregnant women, and the factors related to seafood consumption were similar for both groups.

Karenia brevis, the major HAB dinoflagellate in the Gulf of Mexico, produces potent neurotoxins, known as brevetoxins. Human health is directly impacted by blooms of K. brevis through consumption of shellfish contaminated by accumulated brevetoxins (neurotoxic shellfish poisoning) or from aerosolized brevetoxins in sea spray (reduced respiratory function); however, the reason for brevetoxin production has remained a mystery. Here we show that brevetoxin production increased dramatically in response to osmotic stress in three of the four K. brevis clones examined. By rapidly changing salinity to simulate a shift from oceanic conditions to a decreased salinity typical of coastal conditions, brevetoxin production was triggered. As a result, brevetoxin cell quota increased by >14-fold, while growth rate remained unchanged. Live images of K. brevis cells were also examined to assess changes in cell volume. In the K. brevis Wilson clone, cells responded quickly to hypoosmotic stress by increasing their brevetoxin cell quota from ∼10 to 160 pg of brevetoxin per cell, while cell volume remained stable. In contrast, the K. brevis SP1 clone, which has a consistently low brevetoxin cell quota (<1 pg per cell), was unable to balance the hypoosmotic stress, and although brevetoxin production remained low, average cell volume increased. Our findings close a critical gap in knowledge regarding mechanisms for toxin production in K. brevis by providing an explanation for toxin production in this harmful dinoflagellate."

This study concerns the distribution of [3H]OA in organs and biological fluids of Swiss mice having received a single dose per os of AO (50 microg/kg). The determination of the toxin extracted from mouse organs 24 h after administration of [3H]OA and derivatised with 9-anthryldiazomethane (ADAM) before HPLC and fluorescent detection showed the highest concentration in intestinal tissue and stomach. This distribution was even more pronounced in intestinal tissue, when animal were given per os 90 microg/kg which induced diarrhoea. The high concentrations of [3H]OA in intestinal tissues and contents 24 h after administration demonstrates a slow elimination of OA. When the dose of OA was increased from 50-90 microg/kg, the concentrations of the toxin in the intestinal content and faeces increased proportionally. A good correlation was found between an increase of OA in the intestinal tissue and the diarrhoea in animals given 90 microg/kg orally. Moreover OA was present in liver and bile and in all organs including skin and also fluids. Altogether these results confirmed an enterohepatic circulation of OA as previously shown.

In order to obtain better representativeness of the presence of these microorganisms over time, we have developed passive sampling using the adsorption capacities of polymer membranes. Our objectives here were to assess the feasibility of this methodology for field detection. Different types of membrane were deployed in coastal waters over 2 years and the microorganisms tested using qPCR were: human norovirus (NoV) genogroups (G)I and II, sapovirus, Vibrio spp. and the species Vibrio alginolyticus, V. cholerae, V. vulnificus, and V. parahaemolyticus, OsHV-1 virus, and bacterial markers of fecal contamination. NoV GII, Vibrio spp. , and the AllBac general Bacteroidales marker were quantified on the three types of membrane. NoV GII and OsHV-1 viruses followed a seasonal distribution. All membranes were favorable for NoV GII detection, while Zetapor was more adapted for OsHV-1 detection. Nylon was more adapted for detection of Vibrio spp. and the AllBac marker. The quantities of NoV GII, AllBac, and Vibrio spp. recovered on membranes increased with the duration of exposure. This first application of passive sampling in seawater is particularly promising in terms of an early warning system for the prevention of contamination in oyster farming areas and to improve our knowledge on the timing and frequency of disease occurence."

PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFOSA, and PFUdA were more predominantly and frequently detected than other PFASs in all samples, dominating PFAS patterns in aquatic products. The mean levels of ∑PFASs in different species followed the order: marine shellfish > marine crustaceans > fish > cephalopods > sea cucumber. Profiles of PFASs differ between species, suggesting species-specific accumulation plays a role. Various aquatic species are potential environmental bioindicators that signal individual PFAS contamination. For instance, clams can act as a potential PFOA bioindicator. High ∑PFAS levels in some sites (such as Binzhou, Dongying, Cangzhou, and Weifang) could be attributed to industrial activities involving fluoropolymer manufacture. The differences between PFAS concentrations and profiles in aquatic products across the study regions have been proposed as PFAS fingerprints of the Yellow-Bohai Sea coasts. Analyses of principal components and Spearman correlations indicated that the precursor biodegradation possibly contribute to C8-C10 PFCAs in the study samples. This study reported a wide presence of PFASs in different species of aquatic products across the Yellow-Bohai Sea coasts.

Shellfish contaminated with these toxins create significant public health threat and economic losses to the shellfish industry. For this reason, several methods of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection have been developed in order to gain better knowledge of toxins profiles in shellfish and dinoflagellates samples. These methods have been subjected to continuous modifications to improve and shorten the run time of analysis in the routine monitoring control. In this paper, different samples are analyzed by pre- and post- column HPLC methods to compare toxin profiles. All PSP toxins were individually identified and quantified within the post-column oxidation method. However, although the pre-column oxidation method is significantly more sensitive and detects lower toxin levels, it provides a total amount of toxins that co-elute together, as GTX2 and 3, GTX1 and 4 and dcGTX2 and dcGTX3. The results obtained by both HPLC methods showed similar toxin concentration (expressed in mug/mL) in mussel samples, however when dinoflagellates samples were analyzed the toxin profile and concentration were different. In summary, the post-column oxidation method is accurate to determine the amount of each individual PSP toxin and to know the real toxic profile of non-transformed samples. In addition, this method is easy and faster to screen a large number of samples. The pre-column HPLC method is useful when mussel samples are analyzed even though the time required to prepare the samples is longer."

In shellfish farming area, biological sedimentation contributed to accumulation of AVS. The chromium (II)-reducible sulfur (CRS) was the main component of RIS in mariculture area. The environmental risks of heavy metals in mariculture area presented low levels. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that distribution of Cu closely related to mariculture activities compared to other heavy metals. For ecological risks of heavy metals, the ratio of ∑(acid-soluble fraction (F1) + reducible fraction (F2) + oxidizable fraction (F3))/AVS was the appropriate index rather than conventional simultaneous extraction of heavy metals (SEM)/AVS, because SEM/AVS would overestimate the toxicity of heavy metals.

Here, we conducted a large-scale study of the effect of temperature on the uptake and depuration of paralytic shellfish toxins in three commercial oysters (Saccostrea glomerata and diploid and triploid Crassostrea gigas, n = 252 per species/ploidy level). Oysters were acclimated to two constant temperatures, reflecting current and predicted climate scenarios (22 and 27 °C), and fed a diet including the paralytic shellfish toxin-producing species Alexandrium minutum. While the oysters fed on A. minutum in similar quantities, concentrations of the toxin analogue GTX1,4 were significantly lower in warm-acclimated S. glomerata and diploid C. gigas after 12 days. Following exposure to A. minutum, toxicity of triploid C. gigas was not affected by temperature. Generally, detoxification rates were reduced in warm-acclimated oysters. The routine metabolism of the oysters was not affected by the toxins, but a significant effect was found at a cellular level in diploid C. gigas. The increasing incidences of Alexandrium blooms worldwide are a challenge for shellfish food safety regulation. Our findings indicate that rising ocean temperatures may reduce paralytic shellfish toxin accumulation in two of the three oyster types; however, they may persist for longer periods in oyster tissue."

While advantages of off-bottom culture are significant, the increased use of floating containers raises public health and microbiological concerns, because oysters in floats may be more susceptible to fecal contamination from storm runoff compared to those cultured on-bottom. We conducted four commercial-scale studies with market-size oysters naturally contaminated with fecal coliforms (FC) and a candidate viral indicator, F-specific RNA (FRNA) coliphage. To facilitate sampling and to test for location effects, 12 replicate subsamples, each consisting of 15 to 20 randomly selected oysters in plastic mesh bags, were placed at four characteristic locations within a 0.6- by 3.0-m ""Taylor"" float, and the remaining oysters were added to a depth not exceeding 15.2 cm. The float containing approximately 3,000 oysters was relaid in the York River, Virginia, for 14 days. During relay, increases in shellfish FC densities followed rain events such that final mean levels exceeded initial levels or did not meet an arbitrary product end point of 50 FC/100 ml. FRNA coliphage densities decreased to undetectable levels within 14 days (16 to 28 degrees C) in all but the last experiment, when temperatures fell between 12 and 16 degrees C. Friedman (nonparametric analysis of variance) tests performed on FC/Escherichia coli and FRNA densities indicated no differences in counts as a function of location within the float. The public health consequences of these observations are discussed, and future research and educational needs are identified."

HBCD can easily accumulate in animals and humans and cause neurotoxicity, thyroid hormone disruption, and reproductive disorders. Therefore, it is essential to monitor the HBCD concentrations in foods and estimate the human exposure through the diet. In this study a total of 521 food samples from eight food categories were sampled and analyzed for their HBCD content. Based on consumption data, the average dietary intake of the general Korean population and specific subgroups was calculated. The highest levels of HBCD were found in fish and shellfish (0.47 ng g(-1) ww), and this was attributed to natural exposure to the contaminated marine environments and the HBCD bioaccumulation. In addition, the use of expanded polystyrene buoys in aquaculture was also found to be a potential source of HBCD in bivalves. The high solubility of α-HBCD in water and the persistence of this diastereomer compared to β- and γ-HBCD in biological tissues, led to higher accumulation of α-HBCD in animal-based foods. In contrast, the diastereomeric selectivity and lower metabolic capacity in plants compared with animals led to the predominance of γ-HBCD in plant-based foods. The dietary intake of HBCD was estimated to be 0.82 ng kg(-1) bw d(-1) in the general population and 2.89 ng kg(-1) bw d(-1) in children up to 5 years of age. The high HBCD intake in children was found to be a result of their lower body weight and their high consumption of milk and homemade Korean baby foods that usually contain fish."

Furthermore, some adverse reactions to seafood including histamine fish poisoning (HFP), and intolerance to histamine can trigger clinical symptoms, which, although nonallergic in origin, are similar to true immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic reactions. Because seafood allergy usually remains a lifelong food allergy, this review focuses on the current knowledge on fish and shellfish allergens and emphasizes the importance of differentiating seafood allergy from other allergy-like reactions (anisakiasis, HFP, and intolerance to histamine). Key teaching points: • Fish and shellfish are potent allergens that can provoke serious IgE antibody-mediated adverse reactions in sensitive individuals. • Sensitization to seafood allergens can be achieved by ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact. • Shellfish major allergen, tropomyosin, shares significant homology to arthropods (dust mites and cockroaches). • Accidental exposures to seafood products cross-contaminated with fish or shellfish allergens (hidden allergens) during processing may present a health risk for sensitive individuals. • Allergens of fish parasite A. simplex present common hidden allergens in seafood, particularly in raw and undercooked home-made fish dishes. • Symptoms caused by HFP, histamine intolerance, and anisakiasis are similar to true seafood allergy."

Based on literature data, this review evaluated polymeric sampling as a tool for predicting the bioaccumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) by pelagic and mobile fish and shellfish. Lipid-normalized concentrations (CL) were linked to corresponding equilibrium polymer concentrations (CP) to evaluate the (1) correlation between CL and CP, (2) accuracy when using CP as surrogates for CL, (3) effects of experimental variables on these results, and (4) implications associated with this approach. Generally, strong positive log-log linear correlations existed between CL and CP, meaning that increasing bioaccumulation was well-reflected by increasing polymer accumulation. Further, the majority of the regression lines, as well as individual CL to CP ratios, were within a factor of 10 from the hypothetical 1:1 relationship, suggesting that polymers accumulated concentrations comparable to body residues in fish and shellfish. Interestingly, overall stronger correlations and lower CL to CP ratios resulted when CP were based on sediment compared to water column-deployed samplers. These findings provide a tool for environmental managers when assessing and managing risk associated with PCB-contaminated sediments and waters in protecting vulnerable fish and shellfish species."

When using this method positive samples are fractionated and two different oxidations are required to confirm the identity and quantity of each PST analogue present. There is a need for alternative methods that are simpler, provide faster turnaround times and have improved detection limits. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) HPLC-MS/MS analysis of PST has been used for research purposes, but high detection limits and substantial sample matrix issues have prevented it from becoming a viable alternative for routine monitoring purposes. We have developed a HILIC UPLC-MS/MS method for paralytic shellfish toxins with an optimised desalting clean-up procedure on inexpensive carbon solid phase extraction cartridges for reduction of matrix interferences. This represents a major technical breakthrough and allows sensitive, selective and rapid analysis of paralytic shellfish toxins from a variety of sample types, including many commercially produced bivalve molluscan shellfish species. Additionally, this analytical approach avoids the need for complex calculations to determine sample toxicity, as unlike other methods each PST analogue is able to be quantified as a single resolved peak.

Because algal blooms that produce DA are becoming more widespread and very little is known about the dangers of chronic, low-dose exposure, we initiated a preclinical study focused on the reproductive and developmental effects of DA in a nonhuman primate model. To this end, 32 adult female Macaca fascicularis monkeys were orally exposed to 0, 0.075 or 0.15 mg/kg/day DA on a daily basis, prior to and during pregnancy. Females were bred to non-exposed males and infants were evaluated at birth. Results from this study provided no evidence of changes in DA plasma concentrations with chronic exposure. DA exposure was not associated with reproductive toxicity or adverse changes in the physical characteristics of newborns. However, in an unanticipated finding, our clinical observations revealed the presence of subtle neurological effects in the form of intentional tremors in the exposed adult females. While females in both dose groups displayed increased tremoring, the effect was dose-dependent and observed at a higher rate in females exposed to 0.15 mg/kg/day.

Here, we describe the development and use of a pepsin digestion method for analyzing shellfish samples for these parasites. The conditions of the isolation method did not affect subsequent parasite detection by immunofluorescent antibody test, and allowed examination of 3-g samples of shellfish homogenate, with recovery efficiencies from blue mussel homogenates of between 70 and 80%, and similar recoveries from horse mussel and oyster homogenates. Although exposure of the parasites to the conditions used in the technique affected their viability, as assessed by vital dyes, the maximum reduction in viability after 1-h incubation in digestion solution was 20%. In a preliminary survey of shellfish collected from the Norwegian coast, Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in blue mussel homogenates in 6 (43%) of 14 batches and Giardia cysts in 7 (50%) of these batches. However, this relatively high occurrence, compared with other surveys, may be due to the higher recovery efficiency of the new method, and the relatively large sample size analyzed.

The toxin is responsible for the neurotoxic illness, amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP), that is characterized by gastro-intestinal distress, seizures, memory loss, and death. Established seafood safety regulatory limits of 20 μg DA/g shellfish have been relatively successful at protecting human seafood consumers from short-term high-level exposures and episodes of acute ASP. Significant concerns, however, remain regarding the potential impact of repetitive low-level or chronic DA exposure for which there are no protections. Here, we report the novel discovery of a DA-specific antibody in the serum of chronically-exposed tribal shellfish harvesters from a region where DA is commonly detected at low levels in razor clams year-round. The toxin was also detected in tribal shellfish consumers' urine samples confirming systemic DA exposure via consumption of legally-harvested razor clams. The presence of a DA-specific antibody in the serum of human shellfish consumers confirms long-term chronic DA exposure and may be useful as a diagnostic biomarker in a clinical setting. Adverse effects of chronic low-level DA exposure have been previously documented in laboratory animal studies and tribal razor clam consumers, underscoring the potential clinical impact of such a diagnostic biomarker for protecting human health. The discovery of this type of antibody response to chronic DA exposure has broader implications for other environmental neurotoxins of concern."

The correlation between the occurrence of V. cholerae in Chesapeake Bay and environmental factors was investigated over a 3-year period. Water and plankton samples were collected monthly from five shore sampling sites in northern Chesapeake Bay (January 1998 to February 2000) and from research cruise stations on a north-south transect (summers of 1999 and 2000). Enrichment was used to detect culturable V. cholerae, and 21.1% (n = 427) of the samples were positive. As determined by serology tests, the isolates, did not belong to serogroup O1 or O139 associated with cholera epidemics. A direct fluorescent-antibody assay was used to detect V. cholerae O1, and 23.8% (n = 412) of the samples were positive. V. cholerae was more frequently detected during the warmer months and in northern Chesapeake Bay, where the salinity is lower. Statistical models successfully predicted the presence of V. cholerae as a function of water temperature and salinity. Temperatures above 19 degrees C and salinities between 2 and 14 ppt yielded at least a fourfold increase in the number of detectable V. cholerae. The results suggest that salinity variation in Chesapeake Bay or other parameters associated with Susquehanna River inflow contribute to the variability in the occurrence of V. cholerae and that salinity is a useful indicator. Under scenarios of global climate change, increased climate variability, accompanied by higher stream flow rates and warmer temperatures, could favor conditions that increase the occurrence of V. cholerae in Chesapeake Bay."

In most coastal communities in these countries, drinking water quality, stable food, and livelihoods are primarily dependent on ecological systems and marine resources (e. g. , sediments and fish), thus humans and other receptors are exposed to heavy metal risks through ingestion and dermal contact. This research evaluated the potential ecological risks of heavy metals including Cadmium (Cd), Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni) and Lead (Pb) in water, sediments, and shellfishes ( C. amnicola, U. tangeri, T. fuscatus, P. monodon ) along the Oproama creeks in Niger Delta, Nigeria. The concentrations of heavy metals were measured in three stations within the waterways using the Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) and their relative ecological and human health risk analysed. Health risk evaluation of individual heavy metals in shellfish tissue indicates an adverse health impact. The high mean carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic hazard index (HI) values of Cd (3.74), Pb (4.3), and Cr (8.4) recorded in the shellfish were significantly greater than 1, while the degree of contamination in the sediment (110.84) and water (60.15) were greater than 24 which is an indication of potential adverse ecological and human health impacts for different age groups and residents in the area. This establishes a significant possibility of heavy metal risks to public health, water quality and marine organisms. While in-depth health analysis is recommended, there is an urgent need to reduce oil spills, and an intentional provision of sustainable livelihoods to the local population."

A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methodology (Lawrence method) was implemented in 1996 in the Portuguese monitoring programme as a complementary means of analysis. Comparison between MBA and HPLC was done at the time only by a qualitative approach due to the scarce number of positive samples tested. More quantitative data were obtained recently when studying toxin profiles in Moroccan shellfish, and the correlation found between these two methodologies is reported here for the first time. Two different matrices were studied: blue mussel and the giant cockle Acanthocardia tuberculatum. A good linear correlation was obtained for both matrices. However, a second-degree polynomial best fitted the data at both low and high extremes of toxicity. According to the HPLC quantitative results, 13% of false-negatives could be obtained by MBA due to an underestimation of toxicity near the limit of detection of the MBA. Difficulties on relying solely on HPLC for consumer protection have been aroused with uncommon matrices, such as imported clams or crustaceans, due to the presence of high concentrations of interfering compounds. The solid-phase extraction step of the Lawrence method was implemented to eliminate an unknown compound that could be mistaken for saxitoxin, and an 80% reduction of another common unknown compound eluting close to decarbamoylsaxitoxin. The implementation of the HPLC methodology achieved so far allows a high degree of consumer protection without the need to resource to animal sacrifice."

HAV numbers were then employed to figure the risk of infection based on a dose-response model for echovirus 12. The estimated risk of infection after consumption of lightly cooked clams matched actual attack rates. Our data show that prospective monitoring of bivalve samples may fail to prevent the occurrence of outbreaks, since HAV was detected in 44% of samples directly associated with cases but was undetectable in samples that were randomly collected from the importers and belonged to the same batches. A correlation was nevertheless observed between the prevalence of hepatitis A cases in the harvesting areas and positive HAV isolation in clams, which points to the need to identify and prevent hazards rather than relying on random sampling of finished products to ensure safety. However, when evidence shows that a critical limit of viral contamination has been exceeded in the potential sources of contamination discharging into the shellfish-growing beds, quantitative virological analysis addressing quality assurance and quality control requirements should be performed with the bivalves. This work provides the first evidence of accurate HAV levels in shellfish involved in outbreaks that could be of use for risk assessment purposes."

We have used a PP2A inhibition assay to analyze the total effect of mixtures including OA and one of its analogues, okadaol (OOH), by measuring the activity of individual compounds and of toxin mixtures through the inhibition they exert on the PP2A enzyme. We found that both OA and OOH inhibit PP2A under our experimental conditions, with IC50 values of 0.37 +/- 0.04 nM and 4.3 +/- 0.8 nM, respectively, confirming that OOH is about ten-fold less potent than OA. PP2A assays were also carried out with predefined mixtures of OA and OOH, covering the full dose-response of one compound in the presence of increasing concentrations of the other toxin. The experimental data we obtained were used to analyze their correlation with those that could be calculated by adding the relative effects exerted by individual analogues, and we found that a good correlation exists between the observed and the expected data, when the predicted effect was calculated on the basis of toxicity equivalence factors. Our findings show that an additive model based on the use of toxicity equivalence factors of individual toxins is appropriate for the calculation of the total activity of multi-component mixtures of OA-group compounds in unknown samples."

Species of this genus have a worldwide distribution driven by environmental conditions (temperature, irradiance, salinity, nutrients etc. ), and these factors are sensitive to climate change. The D. acuminata-complex may contain several species, including D. sacculus. The latter has been found in estuaries and semi-enclosed areas, water bodies subjected to quick salinity variations and its natural repartition suggests some tolerance to salinity changes. However, the response of strains of D. acuminata-complex (D. cf. sacculus) subjected to salinity stress and the underlying mechanisms have never been studied in the laboratory. Here, a 24 h hypoosmotic (25) and hyperosmotic (42) stress was performed in vitro in a metabolomic study carried out with three cultivated strains of D. cf. sacculus isolated from the French Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts. Growth rate, biovolume and osmolyte (proline, glycine betaine and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP)) and toxin contents were measured. Osmolyte contents were higher at the highest salinity, but only a significant increase in glycine betaine was observed between the control (35) and the hyperosmotic treatment. Metabolomics revealed significant and strain-dependent differences in metabolite profiles for different salinities. These results, as well as the absence of effects on growth rate, biovolume, okadaic acid (OA) and pectenotoxin (PTXs) cellular contents, suggest that the D. cf. sacculus strains studied are highly tolerant to salinity variations."

We then examined how presenting information on regulation values and primary factors regarding perception affected sense of safety toward regulations and food-consumption intentions. An online survey was conducted with Japanese individuals (N = 1148). Respondents were randomly assigned to one of three groups based on the presentation level of regulation values. People who frequently consumed tuna had a high perception of dread risk of mercury. This suggests that the dread risk perception of mercury does not determine tuna-type consumption behavior; rather, individuals' consumption behavior determines dread risk perception of mercury. Among those with high tuna-type consumption, those receiving information that a safety factor of 10 times had been considered showed a significantly greater sense of safety than did the group that was not presented with information on regulation values (odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 2.04 (1.18-3.53), p < 0.05).

The samples were extracted and purified using a modified QuEChERS procedure and analyzed by UPLC-MS / MS. The statistical analysis was performed in view of the detection of different PFAS components in variety of fishes, shellfishes and crustaceans, respectively. ResultsSixteen PFASs were detected in the survived samples and the total detection rates reached to 99.21 %. The highest ∑PFASs in each sample was 28.27 μg/kg, and the average and medium values of ∑PFAS were 1.83 μg/kg and 1.18 μg/kg, respectively. PFOS and PFBA have been considered as predominant PFAS components with corresponding pollution contribution rates of 29.14% and 24.71%, respectively.

A validated liquid chromatography method with fluorescence detection, involving pre-chromatographic oxidation was used to quantify carbamoyl, N-sulfocarbamoyl and decarbamoyl toxins. In order to test for any matrix effect in the quantification of those toxins, concentrations obtained from solvent and matrix matched calibration curves were compared. A suppression of the fluorescence signal was observed in mussel extract or fraction in comparison to solvent for the compounds dcGTX2 + 3, GTX2 + 3 and GTX1 + 4, while an enhancement was found for C1 + 2, dcSTX, STX, B1, dcNEO and NEO. These results showed that a matrix effect varies among compounds. The difference of concentrations between solvent and matrix matched calibration curves for C1 + 2 (median = 421 ng g⁻¹) exceeded largely the values for the other quantified compounds (0.09-58 ng g⁻¹). Those differences were converted into toxicity differences, using Oshima toxicity equivalence factors. The compounds C1 + 2 and dcNEO were the major contributors to the differences of total toxicity in the mussel samples. The differences of total toxicity were calculated in ten mussel samples collected during a 10-week blooming period in Portuguese coastal lagoon. Values varied between 53 and 218 µg STX equivalents kg⁻¹. The positive differences mean that the estimated toxicity using solvent calibration curves exceed the values taking into account the matrix. For the toxicity interval 200-800 µg STX equivalents kg⁻¹ an increase was found between 44 and 28%."

From a UK perspective, risk is apportioned for different vectors of NoV infection within the population. NoV spreads mainly by person-to-person contact or via unsanitary food handling. NoV also enters the coastal zone via wastewater discharges resulting in contamination of shellfish waters. Typically, NoV persists in the marine environment for several days, with its presence strongly linked to human population density, wastewater discharge rate, and efficacy of wastewater treatment. Shellfish bioaccumulate NoV and current post-harvest depuration is inefficient in its removal. While NoV can be inactivated by cooking (e. g. mussels), consumption of contaminated raw shellfish (e. g. oysters) represents a risk to human health. Consumption of contaminated food accounts for 3-11% of NoV cases in the UK (~74,000 cases/year), of which 16% are attributable to oyster consumption (11,800 cases/year). However, environmental and human factors influencing NoV infectivity remain poorly understood. Lack of standard methods for accurate quantification of infective and non-infective (damaged) NoV particles represent a major barrier, hampering identification of an appropriate lower NoV contamination limit for shellfish. Future management strategies may include shellfish quality assessment (at point of harvest or at point of supply) or harvesting controls. However, poor understanding of NoV inactivation in shellfish and the environment currently limits accurate apportionment and risk assessment for NoV and hence the identification of appropriate shellfish or environmental quality standards."

Despite the recent development of real-time quantitative PCR, quantification of astroviruses in sewage had not been available up to now. We have developed a method to quantify astroviruses in sewage. For this purpose, we designed a set of primers and a fluorogenic probe located at the 3' -end of the genome of human astroviruses. The amplified region was cloned and the plasmid was transcribed to generate calibration standards for quantification. After validation of the standards, the method was evaluated in artificially contaminated samples. To validate the method on naturally contaminated samples, raw and treated wastewater samples were collected monthly for one year in a sewage treatment plant. Astrovirus genomes were detected in all samples collected at the entrance to the sewage treatment plant, with a mean value of 4.1 x 10(6) astrovirus genomes for 100 ml. Effluents were less strongly contaminated, with a mean value of 1.01 x 10(4) astrovirus genomes. The high prevalence of astroviruses in sewage treatment plant effluents indicates that these plants are not efficiently eliminating the virus. This is a major public health concern and new techniques of depuration are needed.

In addition to infectious viruses, this methodology may also detect noninfectious NoV, including fragments of the NoV genome. This study addresses, in part, the implications of qRT-PCR results for the detection of NoV in shellfish in the absence of an infectivity assay. To evaluate environmental persistence, the stability of a short fragment of the NoV genome, spanning the qRT-PCR target in the open reading frame 1/2 junction, was assessed in seawater under artificial environmental conditions simulating winter in the United Kingdom (1 mW/cm² UV irradiation, 8°C) during a 4-week period. Detectable RNA levels decreased exponentially (T₉₀ of approximately 141 h); however, sequences were still detectable for up to 2 weeks. The ability of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) to bioaccumulate NoV particles (from human feces) and RNA fragments was also compared using qRT-PCR. Oysters exposed to NoV particles subsequently were positive for NoV by qRT-PCR at levels several orders of magnitude in excess of the theoretical limit of detection, whereas oysters exposed to similar quantities of NoV RNA were either negative or positive at significantly lower levels. Therefore, although noninfectious fragments of NoV RNA may persist in the environment under winter conditions, this type of material will not be efficiently bioaccumulated by Pacific oysters and should not significantly contribute to positive qRT-PCR results."

Pressures between 300 and 500 MPa were applied for treatment times of 60 to 600 s. In medium containing 15 g/liter salt, the HAV titer was reduced by approximately 1 and 2 log 50% tissue culture infectious dose units (TCID50) per ml after 600 s of treatment with 300 and 400 MPa, respectively. Under the same treatment conditions but in medium containing 30 g/liter salt, HAV was reduced by <0.50 log TCID50/ml. HAV was inactivated by >3 log TCID50/ml after treatment with 500 MPa for 300 and 360 s in medium containing 15 and 30 g/liter salt, respectively. Weibull and log-linear models were fitted to inactivation data. Individual Weibull curves generally provided a good fit at each pressure and salinity, but the curve shapes were qualitatively inconsistent between treatments, making interpolation between pressures difficult and unreliable. High variability was observed in the inactivation data, but the log-linear model described the entire data set and interpolated between specific treatment conditions. Therefore, this model was evaluated by using high pressure to treat HAV artificially inoculated into Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) homogenate adjusted to 15 or 30 g/liter salinity. The log-linear model generally provided fail-safe predictions at pressures > or = 375 MPa and may aid shellfish processors wishing to incorporate HPP into an oyster processing regime. Additional inactivation data with greater reproducibility should be collected to enable expansion of the model and to increase the accuracy of its predictions."

In Japan, the number of national notifications of acute hepatitis E has increased since the introduction of anti-HEV IgA antibody measurement, covered by the national health insurance program, in 2011. In the past three years, we examined five patients of acute hepatitis or acute-on-chronic liver failure caused by HEV infection who presented various clinical courses in the southern area of Ibaraki prefecture in Japan. Of these patients, 78-year-old and 63-year-old male patients presented acute hepatitis E and recovered by only bed rest. The latter patient had a history of consuming grilled or undercooked pork and shellfish prior to the onset of hepatitis E. Among the five patients examined, the infection route was detected only in this patient. Of note, a 65-year-old female patient presented severe hepatitis associated with painless thyroiditis. The patient was diagnosed with probable autoimmune hepatitis and was successfully treated with prednisolone (40 mg/day). Lastly, 58-year-old and 62-year-old male patients, both of whom had a history of diabetes mellitus and alcoholic liver disease, developed acute-on-chronic liver failure, and the latter patient with pre-existing liver cirrhosis died due to liver failure. Thus, patients with clinical HEV infection who display multiple underlying diseases can develop acute-on-chronic liver failure. In conclusion, HEV infection manifests the diverse clinical courses."

In order to minimize the risks of human exposure, the maximum content of these toxins in seafood has been limited by legal regulations worldwide. The regulated limits are established in equivalents of the main representatives of the groups: saxitoxin (STX), okadaic acid (OA), and domoic acid (DA), for PSP, DSP, and ASP, respectively. In this study a multidetection method to screen shellfish samples for the presence of these toxins simultaneously was developed. Multiplexing was achieved using a solid-phase microsphere assay coupled to flow-fluorimetry detection, based on the Luminex xMap technology. The multidetection method consists of three simultaneous competition immunoassays. Free toxins in solution compete with STX, OA, or DA immobilized on the surface of three different classes of microspheres for binding to specific monoclonal antibodies. The IC50 obtained in the buffer was similar in single- and multidetection: 5.6 ± 1.1 ng/mL for STX, 1.1 ± 0.03 ng/mL for OA, and 1.9 ± 0.1 ng/mL for DA. The sample preparation protocol was optimized for the simultaneous extraction of STX, OA, and DA with a mixture of methanol and acetate buffer. The three immunoassays performed well with mussel and scallop matrixes displaying adequate dynamic ranges and recovery rates (around 90% for STX, 80% for OA, and 100% for DA). This microsphere-based multidetection immunoassay provides an easy and rapid screening method capable of detecting simultaneously in the same sample three regulated groups of marine toxins."

However, current bacteriological monitoring procedures which focus on the quantification of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) as a proxy for microbial pollution may not be representative of total bacterial contamination levels present in shellfish harvesting areas. The objective of this study was to critically assess the accuracy of current monitoring strategies by quantifying the spatial (lateral and longitudinal distance) and temporal (seasonality and tidal state) concentrations of FIOs (Escherichia coli and total coliforms) within a single intertidal commercially harvested shellfish bed. Spatial and temporal FIO dynamics, including the effects of tidal state and seasonality, were quantified in mussel flesh and sediment samples from a single intertidal mussel (Mytilus edulis) bed. Our results confirmed that FIO concentrations across a shellfish bed were heterogeneous over larger spatial and temporal scales, but showed no relation to the concentrations of autochthonous bacteria, such as Vibrio spp. , or the physico-chemical parameters of the sediment. These results have important implications for both public health and the economic prosperity of the shellfish industry, and demonstrate the importance of accommodating both spatial and temporal fluctuations in routine bacteriological monitoring protocols. We conclude that current FIO monitoring procedures may not accurately represent levels of microbial contamination within shellfish harvesting areas and that more robust microbiological testing procedures need developing."

This non-essential element is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the ten most troublesome chemical to public health. Its toxicity spectrum depends on the chemical form in which it presents: elemental (metallic), organic or inorganic. The known intoxications are mainly occupational (mining, agriculture, incineration) or related to the use of dental amalgams or the consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish. Nowadays, acute exposures to toxic amounts of mercury are increasingly rare, especially those involving inorganic mercury compounds. The rate is even lower if we refer to intentional poisonings. Although there is a growing understanding of the toxicokinetics of mercury, there is still a lack of studies that support the emerging theories about its bioavailability in humans. In this manuscript we describe a rare case of an individual who committed suicide by ingesting mercuric oxide. The aim is to offer a medical contribution to the better understanding of the kinetics of this metal, making a discussion based on published literature and analyzing its distribution, metabolism, internal doses, target and reservoir organs. The whole case - clinical course of the victim and her fatal destiny, the ante- and post-mortem sample concentrations and the necropsy findings - illustrates a situation that meets specific features of acute poisoning by ingestion of inorganic mercury, thus constituting an important support towards a more realistic and a based on evidence understanding of mercury biodistribution in humans."

Several amphidomatacean species have been confirmed in Irish coastal waters, including the azaspiracid-producing species Azadinium spinosum and Amphidoma languida. Biogeographic distribution studies have been hampered by the fact that these small, armoured dinoflagellates share remarkably similar morphologies when observed by light microscopy. The recent releases of species-specific molecular detection assays have, in this context, been welcome developments. A survey of the south west and west coasts of Ireland was carried out in August 2017 to investigate the late summer distribution of toxic amphidomataceans and azaspiracid toxins. Azadinium spinosum and Am. languida were detected in 83% of samples in the southwest along the Crease Line and Bantry Bay transects between 20 and 70 m depth, with maximal cell concentrations of 7000 and 470,000 cells/L, respectively. Azaspiracid concentrations were well aligned with the distributions of Az. spinosum and Am. languida, up to 1.1 ng/L and 4.9 ng/L for combined AZA-1, -2, -33, and combined AZA-38, -39, respectively. Although a snapshot in time, this survey provides new insights in the late summer prominence of AZAs and AZA-producing species in the southwest of Ireland, where major shellfish aquaculture operations are located. Results showed a substantial overlap in the distribution of amphidomatacean species in the area and provide valuable baseline information in the context of ongoing monitoring efforts of toxigenic amphidomataceans in the region."

Therefore, estimating the whole blood MeHg/THg ratio is critical to predicting MeHg exposure and, subsequently, efforts to establish an exposure-response relationship for use in risk assessment. A large, representative dataset (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2016) was used to determine the whole blood MeHg/THg ratio among (a) self-reported fish and shellfish consumers, ≥ 15 years of age (the ""full adult"" population (N = 5268 training dataset; N = 2336 test dataset)) and (b) female fish and shellfish consumers, 15-44 years of age (the ""women of reproductive age"" population (N = 1285 training dataset; N = 560 test dataset)). Unadjusted and adjusted linear and spline models with direct measurements for both THg and MeHg were evaluated. The mean whole blood MeHg/THg ratio was 0.75 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74, 0.75). This ratio was significantly higher among those with higher THg concentrations. All models exhibited excellent fit (adjusted R2 from 0.957 to 0.982). Performance was slightly improved in spline versus linear models. For the full adult population and women of reproductive age, the unadjusted spline model predicted whole blood MeHg concentrations of 5.65 µg/L and 5.55 µg/L, respectively, when the THg concentration was 5.80 µg/L.

In the past, several initiatives have been taken to model human health risk from NORM in produced water. The parameters of the available risk assessment models are imprecise and sparse in nature. In this study, a fuzzy possibilistic evaluation using fuzzy rule based modeling has been presented. Being conservative in nature, the possibilistic approach considers possible input parameter values; thus provides better environmental prediction than the Monte Carlo (MC) calculation. The uncertainties of the input parameters were captured with fuzzy triangular membership functions (TFNs). Fuzzy if-then rules were applied for input concentrations of two isotopes of radium, namely (226)Ra, and (228)Ra, available in produced water and bulk dilution to evaluate the radium concentration in fish tissue used for human consumption. The bulk dilution was predicted using four input parameters: produced water discharge rate, ambient seawater velocity, depth of discharge port and density gradient. The evaluated cancer risk shows compliance with the regulatory guidelines; thus minimum risk to human health is expected from NORM components in produced water."

The aim of our study was to monitor OA and DTX-1 contamination in commercially available seafood and to provide references for tracking these toxins and preventing disease outbreaks. From 2010 to 2012, 40 species were collected from six coastal cities of four inland seas in China. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a lateral flow immunochromatographic (LFIC) test strip were used to analyse the samples, and the results were further confirmed using a commercially available ELISA kit. The monitoring results indicated that 23 of 40 species were positive for contamination. In addition, 14 of the positive species were determined to be inedible because the content of OA and DTX-1 was above the regulatory limit. Simultaneously, we verified that the digestive glands of shellfish tended to accumulate toxin, in contrast to the flesh. The highest concentrations of OA and DTX-1 were recorded in Scapharca broughtonii, which was collected from Qing Dao, in relation to the other analysed species. Moreover, the Arca family as well as Mytilus galloprovincialis were severely contaminated by OA and its analogue. The above results indicate that some of the commercially available seafood from the coastal cities in China may be inedible due to serious marine toxin contamination. The results of this study might play an important role in protecting consumer health and safety screening of marine products."

The area along the Izmir coast is densely populated, and it includes extensive agricultural lands, industrial and domestic discharge. Shellfish contamination from sewage-polluted waters is very important for public health. Mussel samples were collected by SCUBA equipment. While, counts of culturable heterotrophic bacteria (aerobic, mesophilic) in samples were determined by the spread plate method, fecal coliforms were enumerated by the most probable number (MPN) method using the standard five-tube method. Additionally, samples were evaluated with the presence of Salmonella spp. The results showed that levels of fecal coliforms determined were higher than the allowed limit (>300 MPN/100 g) in all the stations during the study period. Maximum fecal coliform count was observed in all of the stations in March, May and November as 2.4 × 10(5) MPN/100 g. The mean number of culturable heterotrophic bacteria varied between 1.7 × 10(5) and 6.7 × 10(6) CFU/100g, and maximum heterotrophic bacteria level was recorded in March 2006. In addition, the presence of Salmonella spp. was positive in one or more stations in all periods except for January. The results obtained from this study can be of use to prevent potentially harmful adverse effects of microorganisms from polluted waters and shellfish. Necessary hygienic measurements should be regularly taken and shellfish products should certainly not be consumed raw or undercooked."

The impacts of such alterations to the natural cycle of Hg can be minimized through coordinated management, policy decisions, and legislative regulations. An ability to quantitatively measure environmental Hg loadings and spatiotemporal trends of their fate in the environment is critical for science-based decision making. Here, we outline a Hg monitoring program for temperate estuarine and marine ecosystems on the Atlantic Coast of North America. This framework follows a similar, previously developed plan for freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems in the U. S. Methylmercury (MeHg) is the toxicologically relevant form of Hg, and its ability to bioaccumulate in organisms and biomagnify in food webs depends on numerous biological and physicochemical factors that affect its production, transport, and fate. Therefore, multiple indicators are needed to fully characterize potential changes of Hg loadings in the environment and MeHg bioaccumulation through the different marine food webs. In addition to a description of how to monitor environmental Hg loads for air, sediment, and water, we outline a species-specific matrix of biotic indicators that include shellfish and other invertebrates, fish, birds and mammals. Such a Hg monitoring template is applicable to coastal areas across the Northern Hemisphere and is transferable to arctic and tropical marine ecosystems. We believe that a comprehensive approach provides an ability to best detect spatiotemporal Hg trends for both human and ecological health, and concurrently identify food webs and species at greatest risk to MeHg toxicity."

WQS for the protection of human health whose derivation is based in part on anadromous fish, create the expectation that implementation of these WQS will lead to lower contaminant levels in returning adult fish. Whether this expectation can be met is likely a function of where and when such fish are exposed. Various exposure scenarios have been advanced to explain acquisition of bioaccumulative contaminants by Pacific salmonids. This study examined 16 different scenarios with bioenergetics and toxicokinetic models to identify those where WQS might be effective in reducing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)--a representative bioaccumulative contaminant--in returning adult Fall chinook salmon, a representative salmonid. Model estimates of tissue concentrations and body burdens in juveniles and adults were corroborated with observations reported in the literature. Model results suggest that WQS may effect limited (< approximately 2 ×) reductions in PCB levels in adults who were resident in a confined marine water body or who transited a highly contaminated estuary as out-migrating juveniles. In all other scenarios examined, WQS would have little effect on PCB levels in returning adults. Although the results of any modeling study must be interpreted with caution and are not necessarily applicable to all salmonid species, they do suggest that the ability of WQS to meet the expectation of reducing contaminant loadings in anadromous species is limited."

Despite the detrimental health impacts of human NoV-contaminated seafood to public health, there is a lack of knowledge on the physicochemical conditions that govern NoV transmission in aquatic ecosystems. In the present study, we investigated the propensity for NoVs to associate with aquatic aggregates, which have been shown to efficiently deliver nano-sized particles to shellfish. Specific physicochemical conditions characteristic of shellfish cultivation waters, specifically salinity and transparent exopolymer particles (TEP), were targeted in this study for investigating aggregate formation and NoV association dynamics. Murine norovirus (MNV) was used in aggregation experiments as a model surrogate for NoVs. Results demonstrate increased aggregate formation as a function of increasing salinity and TEP concentrations, as well as greater numbers of MNV genomes incorporated into aggregates under conditions that favor aggregation. As aggregate formation was enhanced in waters representing optimal conditions for shellfish production, specifically saline and high TEP waters, the implications to virus transport and shellfish food safety are profound: more aggregates implies increased scavenging of virus particles from surrounding waters and therefor greater risk for bivalve contamination with nano-sized pathogens. These novel data provide insight into where and when NoVs are most likely to be ingested by shellfish via contaminated aggregates, thereby informing best management and water quality monitoring practices aimed at providing safe seafood to consumers."

A geochemical normalisation approach by using aluminium allowed for discrimination of sediment contamination among sites. Indeed, Fadiouth appeared highly contaminated with Cd, Hg and Ni compared to the Saloum Delta. For all mangrove sites, trace metals exhibited significant higher concentrations (on a dry weight basis) in shellfish compared to sediments, excepted for Ni and Pb. The distribution pattern followed a similar global trend in molluscs regardless of the spatio-temporal variability, with the predominance of Zn (80% of total metals) followed by Cu and Cd. However, strong differences of metal bioavailability and bioaccumulation in biota were demonstrated, revealing the requirement of employing a suite of organism bioindicators to monitor metal contamination in mangrove ecosystems. From an ecotoxicological point of view, trace metal levels in sediments from the Petite Côte and the Sine-Saloum Estuary were below the effects range-low (ERL) threshold limit of the sediment quality guidelines for adverse biological effects (SQGs). On the opposite, some concerns about Cd contamination of edible shellfish from Southern West Senegal were highlighted, from both the safety point of view of local populations' health, and the chemical quality point of view of exported resources."

The purpose of this study is to apply PSD data in a Public Health Assessment to demonstrate that PSDs can be used as a biological surrogate to evaluate potential human health risks and elucidate spatio-temporal variations in risk. PSDs were used to measure polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the Willamette River; upriver, downriver and within the Portland Harbor Superfund megasite for 3 years during wet and dry seasons. Based on an existing Public Health Assessment for this area, concentrations of PAHs in PSDs were substituted for fish tissue concentrations. PSD measured PAH concentrations captured the magnitude, range and variability of PAH concentrations reported for fish/shellfish from Portland Harbor. Using PSD results in place of fish data revealed an unacceptable risk level for cancer in all seasons but no unacceptable risk for non-cancer endpoints. Estimated cancer risk varied by several orders of magnitude based on season and location. Sites near coal tar contamination demonstrated the highest risk, particularly during the dry season and remediation activities. Incorporating PSD data into Public Health Assessments provides specific spatial and temporal contaminant exposure information that can assist public health professionals in evaluating human health risks."

Oysters were collected monthly for 13 months from four different harvesting areas in the Oosterschelde Delta. Oyster samples were classified by determining Escherichia coli levels according to the standards set by the Councils Directive (91/ 492/EEC). Two of 36 commercial and 2 of 28 noncommercial oyster samples were B-classified and therefore not ready for consumption. All other oyster samples were A-classified. For the detection of viral RNA, 150 mg of hepatopancreatic tissue was subjected to the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit, followed by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and Southern blot hybridization. Enterovirus RNA was detected in 14 of 64 oyster samples, of which 4 were from noncommercial oyster harvesting areas and 10 were from commercial harvesting areas. None of the other human pathogenic viruses were detected. The levels of somatic coliphages and F-specific phages were also determined in all 64 oyster samples, with some samples containing high phage levels (>50 PFU/g of hepatopancreatic tissue), but with most samples containing low phage levels (<50 PFU/g of hepatopancreatic tissue).

This is particularly problematic for the king scallop Pecten maximus, which retains high burdens of DA from months to years compared to other fast-depurator bivalves. Nonetheless, the physiological and cellular processes responsible for this retention are still unknown. In this work, for the first time, a novel immunohistochemical techniques based on the use of an anti-DA antibody was successfully developed and applied for DA-detection in bivalve tissues at a subcellular level. Our results show that in naturally contaminated P. maximus following a Pseudo-nitzschia australis outbreak, DA is visualized mainly within small membrane-bounded vesicles (1 - 2.5 µm) within the digestive gland cells, identified as autophagosomic structures by means of immune-electron microscopy, as well as in the mucus-producing cells, particularly those from gonad ducts and digestive tract. Trapping of DA in autophagososomes may be a key mechanism in the long retention of DA in scallops. These results and the development of DA-immunodetection are essential to provide a better understanding of the fate of DA, and further characterize DA contamination-decontamination kinetics in marine bivalves, as well as the main mechanisms involved in the long retention of this toxin in P. maximus."

We investigated whether bacteriophages could be used as a proxy to monitor for the presence of distinct V. parahaemolyticus STs in coastal waters. For this purpose, bacteriophages infecting V. parahaemolyticus were isolated from water samples collected on the Northeast Atlantic coast. The isolated phages were tested against a collection of 29 V. parahaemolyticus isolates representing 18 STs, including six clonal complexes (CC). Four distinct phages were identified based on their ability to infect different sets of V. parahaemolyticus isolates. Overall, the 29 bacterial isolates segregated into one of eight patterns of susceptibility, ranging from resistance to all four phages to susceptibility to any number of phages. STs represented by more than one bacterial isolate segregated within the same pattern of susceptibility except for one V. parahaemolyticus ST. Other patterns of susceptibility included exclusively clinical isolates represented by distinct STs.

Twenty-four monthly samples of oysters from 39 United Kingdom production areas, chosen to represent a range of potential contamination risk, were tested for norovirus genogroups I and II by using a quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR method. Norovirus was detected in 76.2% (643/844) of samples, with all sites returning at least one positive result. Both prevalences (presence or absence) and norovirus levels varied markedly between sites. However, overall, a marked winter seasonality of contamination by both prevalence and quantity was observed. Correlations were found between norovirus contamination and potential risk indicators, including harvesting area classifications, Escherichia coli scores, and environmental temperatures. A predictive risk score for norovirus contamination was developed by using a combination of these factors. In summary, this study, the largest of its type undertaken to date, provides a systematic analysis of norovirus contamination in commercial oyster production areas in the United Kingdom.

They are grouped together due to the imino group functioning as their common pharmacore, responsible for acute neurotoxicity in mice. Cyclic imines (CIs) have not been linked yet to human poisoning and are not regulated in the European Union (EU), although the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) requires more data to perform conclusive risk assessment for consumers. Several commercial samples of bivalves including raw and processed samples from eight countries (Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Ireland, Norway, The Netherlands and Denmark) were obtained over 2 years. Emerging cyclic imine concentrations in all the samples were analysed on a LC-3200QTRAP and LC-HRMS QExactive mass spectrometer. In shellfish, two CIs, pinnatoxin G (PnTX-G) and 13-desmethylspirolide C (SPX-1) were found at low concentrations (0.1-12µg/kg PnTX-G and 26-66µg/kg SPX-1), while gymnodimines and pteriatoxins were not detected in commercial (raw and processed) samples. In summary, SPX-1 (n: 47) and PnTX-G (n: 96) were detected in 9.4% and 4.2% of the samples, respectively, at concentrations higher than the limit of quantification (LOQ), and in 7.3% and 31.2% of the samples at concentrations lower than the LOQ (25µg/kg for SPX-1 and 3µg/kg for PnTX-G), respectively. For the detected cyclic imines, the average exposure and the 95th percentile were calculated. The results obtained indicate that it is unlikely that a potential health risk exists through the seafood diet for CIs in the EU. However, further information about CIs is necessary in order to perform a conclusive risk assessment."

These poisoning incidents have resulted in losses to local economies due to shellfish harvest closures. Thus the development of an effective biotoxin monitoring program designed specifically for the remote regions of Alaska would provide protection for public health and allow for a viable shellfish industry. The present study provides data useful for the development of an effective toxin screening protocol by comparing PST levels quantified in shellfish by many of the currently available PST detection techniques. Seven bivalve species were collected along beaches of the Aleutian Islands from June 2006 to September 2007. The concentration of PSTs was quantified and compared using five different analytical methods: the mouse bioassay, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), receptor-binding assay, the commercially available Jellett Rapid PSP Test strips, and an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay technique. The Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC)-approved HPLC method proved to be valuable for characterizing the suite of individual PSTs in each species for research purposes, but was not considered practical for rapid toxin screening in remote Alaskan regions due to its time-consuming nature and requirement of expensive equipment and considerable expertise. In the present study, Jellett test strips were shown to be an effective tool for rapid screening, however due to the high percentage of false positives, subsequent validation via AOAC-approved methods would be required to prevent unnecessary closures."

Weekly phytoplankton samples, oceanographic (CTD, nutrients) and meteorological (precipitation, wind) parameters were analyzed at 5 stations in the bay during the dry and wet seasons of 2018. Liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to detect particulate DA (pDA). Vegetative cells of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and pDA were found in 98.6% and 51.4% of the samples, respectively. pDA levels were low, yet detected throughout the campaign, implying that Ambon Bay might potentially be subject to amnesic shellfish poisoning. The highest levels of both Pseudo-nitzschia spp. cell abundance and pDA were found in the wet season, showing a strong positive correlation between both parameters, compared to the dry season, (r = 0.87 and r = 0.66 (p < 0.01), respectively). Statistical analyses revealed that temperature and mixed layer depth positively correlated with Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and pDA during the dry season, while ammonium showed positive correlations in both seasons. This study represents the first successful investigation of the presence and variability of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and its neurotoxin DA in Indonesian waters."

Three pairs of molecular probes targeting each of these genes were designed and synthesized. The one-step LAMP reaction was conducted at 65°C for 40 min.

Noroviruses were also found in estuarine sediment and in shellfish harvested for human consumption. As PCR-based methods were used for quantification, viral infectivity and degradation was estimated using a NoV capsid integrity assay. The assay revealed low-levels of viral decay in wastewater effluent compared to influent, and more significant decay in environmental waters and sediment.

The aim of this study was to describe a norovirus outbreak connected to insufficient heat treatment during preparation of a shellfish soup in serving portions, during a company Christmas celebration in Norway, December 2013. A questionnaire sent to the employees, showed that 67 % (n = 43) of the celebration participants, reported gastrointestinal symptoms including stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and light fever in the period between 24 and 48 h post celebration. Several dishes were served, including shellfish soup made with carpet shell clams (Tapes rhomboides) in porcelain cups. Consuming this soup, was the only significant risk factor for infection. Norovirus GI and GII were detected in the remaining raw shellfish. To mimic the time and temperature obtained during bivalve soup preparation, raw chopped shellfish tissue and raw cepa onion were added in porcelain cups tempered to 20 °C. To each of these cups, boiling soup base was added. The temperature in the shellfish tissue was continuously recorded, and showed a maximum of 49 °C in the period between 3 and 7 min after adding the boiling soup base. After 1 h the temperature was 30 °C. This time and temperature combination was obviously not sufficient for inactivation of norovirus present in the shellfish tissue. In conclusion, the heat-absorbing capacity of cold ingredients, utensils and table wear porcelain should not be underestimated during food production. Consumers who want to avoid eating raw shellfish, should not assume that the shellfish tissue in preparation as described in our study is adequately heat treated."

However, the likely intakes of phycotoxins via shellfish consumption are almost unknown because both contamination and consumption data are very scarce. Thus, two 1-year surveys were conducted (through the same population: recreational shellfish harvesters and from the same geographical area) to assess: shellfish consumption and contamination by major toxins (domoic acid (DA) group, okadaic acid (OA) group and spirolides (SPXs)). Recreational shellfish harvesters had been targeted as an at-risk subpopulation because they consume more shellfish than general population and because they eat not only commercial shellfish species controlled by official authorities but also their own harvests of shellfish species may be in non-controlled areas and more over shellfish species non-considered in the official control species. Then, these two kinds of data were combined with deterministic and probabilistic approaches for both acute and chronic exposures, on considering the impact of shellfish species and cooking on phycotoxin levels. For acute risk, monitoring programs seem to be adequate for DAs, whereas OAs could be a matter of concern for high consumers (their acute intakes were up to ninefold the acute reference dose (ARfD)). About chronic risk, OAs are a matter of concern. The daily OAs intakes were close to the ARfD, which is, by definition, greater than the tolerable daily intake. Moreover, SPX contamination is low but regular, no (sub)chronic SPX toxicity data exist; but in case of (sub)chronic toxicity, SPX exposure should be considered."

This study was designed to evaluate the occurrence of MRSA in samples of fish and seafood from commercial outlets located in the Tri-City area (Poland). In this study, we investigated a 44 food samples, including fish and seafood collected from various retail outlets in the Tri-City area of Poland. The first stage of staphylococcus isolation was initial culture in Giolitti-Cantoni broth. After 24 h, if blackening had occurred at the bottom (or there was general blackening of the medium), the samples were spread plated onto a CHROMagar MRSA base. The cultures were then incubated for 24 h at a temperature of 37°C. Of the 44 samples, 26 were positive for MRSA. The samples most often contaminated with MRSA were cephalopods (6 of 9) and crustaceans (10 of 15), followed by samples taken from mollusks (4 of 7) and fish (6 of 13). The correlation between the species from which the samples were obtained and the presence of S. aureus was not significant (P > 0.05). The high frequency of occurrence of MRSA in these products points to the potential risk of transmission of diseases through the food chain. The results obtained are significant and useful for S. aureus risk assessment programs for aquatic products."

Here, norovirus reduction from Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas), contaminated in the marine environment, was studied in laboratory depuration trials and in two commercial settings. Norovirus concentrations were measured in oyster digestive tissue before, during and post-depuration using the ISO 15216-1 quantitative real-time RT-PCR method. Results of the laboratory-based studies demonstrate that statistically significant reductions of up to 74% of the initial norovirus GII concentration was achieved after 3 days at 17-21 °C and after 4 days at 11-15 °C, compared to 44% reduction at 7-9 °C. In many trials norovirus GII concentrations were reduced to levels below 100 genome copies per gram (gcg-1; limit of quantitation; LOQ). Virus reduction was also assessed in commercial depuration systems, routinely used by two Irish oyster producers. Up to 68% reduction was recorded for norovirus GI and up to 90% for norovirus GII reducing the geometric mean virus concentration close to or below the LOQ. In both commercial settings there was a significant difference between the levels of reduction of norovirus GI compared to GII (p < 0.05). Additionally, the ability to reduce the norovirus concentration in oysters to < LOQ differed when contaminated with concentrations below and above 1000 gcg-1. These results indicate that depuration, carried out at elevated (> 11 °C) water temperatures for at least 3 days, can reduce the concentration of norovirus in oysters and therefore consumer exposure providing a practical risk management tool for the shellfish industry."

The Penobscot is a system contaminated with Hg by a chlor-alkali plant that operated from 1967 to 2000, discharging 6-12 tons of mercury into the river. Mercury levels in aquatic biota were highest at sites downstream of the chlor-alkali plant and spatial trends were similar to those of sediments. Mean total Hg concentrations in fish muscle (adjusted for size or age) in the most affected areas were 521 (480, 566; 95% CI) ng/g ww in American eels, 321 (261,395) in mummichog, 121 (104, 140) in rainbow smelt, 155 (142,169) in tomcod, 55.2 (42.7,71.4) in winter flounder, and 328 (259,413) in American lobster tail and 522 (488,557) ng/g dw in blue mussel. Levels exceeded the 50 ng/g ww considered protective for piscivorous predators and were of concern for human health, with American eels and American lobster exceeding Maine's mercury action level of 200 ng/g ww. Calculations of trophic position (using nitrogen isotopes) suggested that the spatial patterns observed in total Hg concentrations were not due to changes in feeding habits of the species. Fish feeding in benthic food webs, as defined by stomach content and stable carbon isotope analyses, showed no change in Hg concentrations over time. In contrast, declining trends in Hg were found in two species dependent on pelagic food webs. The absence of declines in Hg concentrations in the benthically-based food webs, despite the fact that most Hg was discharged into the system >40 years ago, is consistent with the long recovery predicted from dated sediment cores and from similar studies elsewhere."

Aquaculture production as well as fish consumption per capita have been dramatically increasing over the past two decades. Shifting of culture method from semi-intensive to intensive technique and applying of antibiotics to control the disease outbreak are the major factors for the increasing trend of aquaculture production. Antibiotics are usually present at subtherapeutic levels in the aquaculture environment, which increases the selective pressure to the resistant bacteria and stimulates resistant gene transfer in the aquatic environment. It is now widely documented that antibiotic resistance genes and resistant bacteria are transported from the aquatic environment to the terrestrial environment and may pose adverse effects on human and animal health. However, data related to antibiotic usage and bacterial resistance in aquaculture is very limited or even absent in major aquaculture-producing countries. In particular, residual levels of antibiotics in fish and shellfish are not well documented. Recently, some of the countries have already decided the maximum residue levels (MRLs) of antibiotics in fish muscle or skin; however, many antibiotics are yet not to be decided. Therefore, an urgent universal effort needs to be taken to monitor antibiotic concentration and resistant bacteria particularly multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria and to assess the associated risks in aquaculture. Finally, we suggest to take an initiative to make a uniform antibiotic registration process, to establish the MRLs for fish/shrimp and to ensure the use of only aquaculture antibiotics in fish and shellfish farming globally."

This study compared the distribution of E. coli and F+ RNA bacteriophages in shellfish grown in harvesting areas of Greece and also examined the presence and proportions of the different subgroups of F+ RNA coliphages in shellfish. F+ RNA bacteriophages were present in shellfish at higher concentrations than E. coli. Elevated numbers of F+ RNA bacteriophages observed in the winter concur with the known increased viral risk associated with shellfish harvested at that time of year in Greece. The majority of F+ RNA coliphages detected in shellfish samples belonged to group IV which indicated the possible presence of animal faecal material in sample harvesting areas. Phages of groups II and III (human waste and human faecal material, respectively) were present at low levels. Finally, 8% of the phages hybridised were found to belong to group I. The presence of group IV showed seasonal distribution (more in winter, less in summer) whereas the other groups did not show any difference. Monitoring of F+ coliphage subgroups may indicate the presence and major sources of microbial inputs to surface waters; however, environmental effects on the relative occurrence of different groups need to be considered."

Our objective was to assess MP contamination in mussels collected around the coast of Scotland (UK) to identify characteristics of MPs and to evaluate risk of human exposure to MPs via ingestion of mussels. We deployed caged mussels (Mytilus edulis) in an urbanised estuary (Edinburgh, UK) to assess seasonal changes in plastic pollution, and collected mussels (Mytilus spp and subtidal Modiolus modiolus) from eight sampling stations around Scotland to enumerate MP types at different locations. We determined the potential exposure of humans to household dust fibres during a meal to compare with amounts of MPs present in edible mussels. The mean number of MPs in M. modiolus was 0.086 ± 0.031 (SE, n = 6)/g ww (3.5 ± 1.29 (SE) per mussel). In Mytilus spp, the mean number of MPs/g ww was 3.0 ± 0.9 (SE, n = 36) (3.2 ± 0.52 (SE) per mussel), but weight dependent. The visual accuracy of plastic fibres identification was estimated to be between 48 and 50%, using Nile Red staining and FT-IR methodologies, respectively, halving the observed amounts of MPs in wild mussels. We observed an allometric relationship between the number of MPs and the mussels wet weight. Our predictions of MPs ingestion by humans via consumption of mussels is 123 MP particles/y/capita in the UK and can go up to 4620 particles/y/capita in countries with a higher shellfish consumption. By comparison, the risk of plastic ingestion via mussel consumption is minimal when compared to fibre exposure during a meal via dust fallout in a household (13,731-68,415 particles/Y/capita)."

The analysis of several redox status biomarkers, metallothioneins (MTs), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), reduced glutathione (GSH) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), was monitored as a response to TE bioaccumulation and environmental parameters variability. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between mean seasonal TE concentrations in A. noae soft tissue. The highest TE concentrations in A. noae soft tissues were recorded during summer, which coincided with the increase of body dry weight (BDW) and the gonad index (GI). During this season, biomarker responses were enhanced, revealing significant increases of MTs, MDA and GSH levels as well as GPx activity in A. noae tissues, while a decrease of AChE activity was observed. The levels of TE analyzed in A. noae and several parameters used to assess the potential human risk (estimated weekly intake, target hazard quotient and target hazard risk) were lower than the permissible limits for safe seafood consumption. Consequently, this shellfish can be considered safe for human consumption. This preliminary study presents prospects for the valorization of this seafood product in Tunisia's food sector. It also gives basal information for future environmental assessment studies in which A. noae could be used as early warning tools in the field of biomonitoring programs and confirms the usefulness of biomarkers to monitor the health status of aquatic organisms."

The toxin acts as a glutamate agonist and is excitotoxic in the vertebrate central nervous system and other glutamate receptor-rich organs. Human exposure to domoic acid occurs via the consumption of contaminated shellfish that have accumulated the toxin while filter feeding on toxigenic phytoplankton during blooms. The first reported human domoic acid poisoning event occurred in Canada in 1987 during which clinical signs of acute toxicity such as gastrointestinal distress, confusion, disorientation, memory loss, coma and death were observed. The illness was named amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) and due to effective seafood monitoring programs there have been no documented ASP cases since 1987. However, domoic acid poisoning has a significant effect on marine wildlife and multiple poisoning events have occurred in marine birds and mammals over the last few decades. Currently, domoic acid producing diatom blooms are thought to be increasing in frequency world wide, posing an increasing threat to wildlife and human health. Of particular concern are the potential impacts of long-term low-level exposure in ""at risk"" human populations. The impacts of repetitive low-level domoic acid exposure are currently unknown. This review provides a basic description of the mechanism of action of domoic acid as well as a synthesis of information pertaining to domoic acid exposure routes, toxin susceptibility, and the importance of effective monitoring programs. The importance of investigating the potential human health impacts of long-term low-level domoic acid exposure in ""at risk"" human populations is also discussed."

The doses included the proposed human Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) (0.075 mg/kg/day) for DA. Adult females were bred to nonexposed males. To evaluate development during early infancy, offspring were administered a Neonatal Assessment modeled after the human Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale and a series of Visual Recognition Memory problems using the novelty paradigm. Results indicated that prenatal DA exposure did not impact early survival reflexes or responsivity to the environment. Findings from the recognition memory assessment, given between 1-2 months of age, showed that exposed and control infants demonstrated robust novelty scores when test problems were relatively easy to solve. Performance was not diminished by the introduction of delay periods. However, when more difficult recognition problems were introduced, the looking behavior of the 0.15 mg/kg DA group was random and infants failed to show differential visual attention to novel test stimuli. This finding suggests subtle but significant impairment in recognition memory and demonstrates that chronic fetal exposure to DA may impact developing cognitive processes."

The potential risk for human health due to the continuous presence of these toxins in food has not been clearly established. We have used cerebellar primary cultures to investigate the effects of the DSP toxin dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX-2) on central nervous system neurons and glial cells. Exposure to DTX-2 produced neurotoxicity at concentrations starting at 2.5 nM, characterized first by disintegration of neurites and later by cell death. DTX-2-induced neurodegeneration required long exposures (at least 20 h), involved DNA fragmentation and condensation and fragmentation of chromatin, typical hallmarks of apoptosis, and required the synthesis of new proteins. The concentration that reduced by 50% the maximum neuronal survival after 24 h exposure to DTX-2 (EC50(24)) was approximately 8 nM. Morphology and viability of glial cells remained unaffected up to at least 15 nM DTX-2. Higher concentrations of the toxin caused strong shrinkage of glial cell bodies and retraction of processes, and a significant reduction of glial cell viability. Glial toxicity by DTX-2 involved typical apoptotic condensation and fragmentation of chromatin. Compared to neurons, the effect on glial cells was a much shorter process, and extensive glial degeneration and death occurred after 7 h exposure to DTX-2 (EC50(7) approximately 50 nM; EC50(24) approximately 30 nM). Although further experiments are needed to confirm these toxic actions in vivo, our in vitro data suggest that chronic exposure to amounts of DSP toxins below the current safety regulatory limits may represent a risk for human health that should be taken into consideration."

The PCBs can be quantified as Aroclor mixtures, as individual PCB congeners, or as PCB homologues. The methodological choice is driven by many considerations, including cost, but it is important to note that the risk assessment methods recommended by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. EPA) have specific and varying requirements for these analytical endpoints. The toxic equivalency approach is recommended for settings where the original Aroclor mixtures have been heavily degraded or weathered. Because this method only addresses the dioxin-like fraction of the PCB mass, the remaining PCB congeners need to be quantified and assessed separately, in a manner that is consistent with current U. S. EPA guidance. In this present analysis, we examined various methods for estimating a total nondioxin-like PCB mass in fish tissue samples from a New Jersey waterway using congener and homologue data: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimate of the PCB total based on 18 congeners sigma dioxin-like congeners, an estimate of the PCB total from 38 analyzed congeners--sigma dioxin-like congeners, and the total of nine homologue groups--sigma dioxin-like congeners. These three approaches yielded similar estimates of the total nondioxin-like PCBs for a variety of fish species, whereas the totals quantified as Aroclor 1248, 1254, or 1260 were typically more than fivefold lower. Based on these results, the selection of the PCB analytical endpoints obtained from field investigations of fish and shellfish should be guided by the appropriate risk assessment methodology and by the analytical limitations."

The species is sedentary and filter-feeding, which favors bioaccumulation of pollutants in their tissues. Oysters may be suitable for studies on disturbance by pollutants of physiological activities, among which defense mechanisms are poorly documented in bivalves. In this study, effects of pollutants on hemocyte functions were monitored in Pacific oyster, C. gigas. Hemocytes were exposed in vitro to selected pollutants. The strategy for investigating the effects of pollutants on hemocyte functions is based on several biomarkers, which is more relevant than that of published papers based on single-endpoint experiments. Pollutants belonging to the most important groups of xenobiotics (PAHs, PCBs, and pesticides) were selected and their effect on hemocyte activities was analyzed using flow cytometry. Twenty-three pollutants were tested and eight of them showed significant modulation of hemocyte activities. PAHs and PCB 77 induced a decrease of hemocyte activity after an incubation periods of 4 and 24 h at 200 micro mol/L. Three pesticides (2,4D, paraoxon, and chlorothalonil) modulated hemocyte activities. A mixture of eight pesticides also decreased phagocytotic activity.

Using Mengovirus as a surrogate for foodborne viruses, five extraction methods based on RNA release by Trizol were compared on clams and oysters. A procedure consisting of Trizol, PureLink RNA Mini Kit, followed by Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) treatment and LiCl precipitation was found to provide RNA with the highest extraction efficiency and negligible inhibitory effect on real-time RT-PCR. This procedure was further compared to standard extraction method (ISO 15216) using clam, mussel and oyster samples spiked with Hepatitis A virus, Norovirus (NoV) GI and GII as well as bivalve samples naturally contaminated with NoV GI or GII. Results clearly demonstrated that the developed method provided, on average, a recovery 4·3 times higher than the standard reference protocol as well as good repeatability. A direct extraction procedure was developed to recover viral RNA from shellfish with improved efficiency in comparison to reference extraction method (ISO 15216). Without the need for specific equipment, this procedure offers an alternative for performing food safety controls and for risk assessment studies.

This study used optimised molecular methods to detect the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. , G. duodenalis and T. gondii in commercially sourced green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus), an endemic species found throughout coastal New Zealand. A nested polymerase chain reaction was validated for detection of T. gondii DNA and applied to 104 commercially sourced mussels. Thirteen mussels were positive for T. gondii DNA with an estimated true prevalence of 16.4% using Bayesian statistics, and the presence of T. gondii in mussels was significantly associated with collection during the summer compared with that in the winter (P = 0.003). Consumption of contaminated shellfish may also pose a health risk for humans and marine wildlife. As only sporulated T. gondii oocysts can be infectious, a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm presence of a sporozoite-specific marker (SporoSAG), detected in four mussels. G. duodenalis assemblage B, known to be pathogenic in humans, was also discovered in 1% mussels, tested by polymerase chain reaction (n = 90). Cryptosporidium spp. was not detected in the sampled mussel haemolymph. Results suggest that New Zealand may have high levels of coastal contamination with T. gondii, particularly in summer months, and that naturally exposed mussels can ingest and retain sporulated oocysts, further establishing shellfish consumption as a health concern."

This work proposes a methodology for quantifying flows of plastics from the life cycle of the seafood products to the environment. It is based on loss rate and final release rate considering a pre-fate approach as proposed by the Plastic Leak Project. They are defined for 5 types of micro and macro plastic losses: lost fishing gears, marine coatings, plastic pellets, tire abrasion and plastic mismanaged at the end-of-life. The methodology is validated with a case study applied to French fish products for which relevant data are available in the Agribalyse 3.0 database. Results show that average plastic losses are from 75 mg to 4345 mg per kg of fish at the consumer, depending on the species and the related fishing method. The main plastic losses come from lost fishing gears (macroplastics) and tire abrasion (microplastics). Results show high variability: when mismanaged, plastic packaging at the end-of-life (macroplastics) is the main loss to the environment. As a next step the methodology is to be applied to other fish or shellfish products, or directly implemented in a life cycle inventory database. Further research should characterize the related impacts to the environment when life cycle impact assessment methodologies will be available, and identify eco-design solutions to decrease the major flows to the environment identified."

Major shellfish harvesting and relaying areas from different areas in Sardinia region were defined and studied by analysing different physicochemical parameters in the water and the levels of Escherichia coli (E. coli), Norovirus (NoVs) genogroup I (NoVGI), NoVs genogroup II (NoVGII) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) in the shellfish harvested and farmed from 2009 to 2011. During that period the identification of the viral agents was carried out by one step real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Escherichia coli according to ISO TS 16649-3:2005 standard method. A total of 1266 shellfish samples were tested for NoVGI, NoVGII, HAV and faecal indicators. Norovirus contamination was found in 337 samples (26.6%); only one sample of mussels was positive for HAV (0.08%); while E. coli prevalence was 3.8% in shellfish. The probability of observing shellfish samples positive for NoVs, HAV and E. coli presence was associated with harvesting, growing and relaying areas, period of sampling, environmental parameters, animal species (P<0.05). Although the higher prevalence rate of human enteropathogenic viruses was found in the winter period, we did not observe a significant relationship between the effect of seawater temperature (seasonality) and NoVs presence all over the study period; in fact, according to statistical analysis, the presence of human enteric viruses does not appear to be related to water temperature."

The occurrence of microcystin-LR (MCYST-LR) has been reported since 1990 and a significant number of water reservoirs that are used for drinking water attain high levels of this toxin. Aquatic animals that live in eutrophic freshwater ecosystems may be killed by microcystins but in many cases the toxicity is sublethal and so the animals can survive long enough to accumulate the toxins and transfer them along the food chain. Among these, edible mollusks, fish and crayfish are especially important because they are harvested and sold for human consumption. Mussels that live in estuarine waters and rivers where toxic blooms occur may accumulate toxins without many significant acute toxic effects. In this study data are presented in order to understand the dynamics of the accumulation and depuration of MCYST-LR in mussels. The toxin is readily accumulated and persists in the shellfish for several days after contact. In the crayfish the toxin is accumulated mainly in the gut but is also cleared very slowly. In carps, although the levels of the toxins found in naturally caught specimens were not very high, some toxin was found in the muscle and not only in the viscera. This raises the problem of the toxin accumulation by fish and possible transfer through the food chain. The data gathered from these experiments and from naturally caught specimens are analyzed in terms of risk for human consumption. The occurrence of microcystins in tap water and the incidence of toxic cyanobacteria in fresh water beaches in Portugal are reported. The Portuguese National Monitoring Program of cyanobacteria is mentioned and its implications are discussed."

In this review, we have examined the currently methodologies and molecular characterization techniques for assessing the phenotypic, genotypic and functional characteristics of STEC O157 and non-O157. In particular, traditional culture and isolation methods, including selective enrichment and differential plating, have enabled the effective recovery of STEC. Following recovery, immunological serotyping of somatic surface antigens (O-antigens) and flagellum (H-antigens) are employed for the classification of the STEC isolates. Molecular genotyping methods, including multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis, arrays, and whole genome sequencing, can discriminate the isolate virulence profile beyond the serotype level. Virulence profiling is focused on the identification of chromosomal and plasmid genes coding for adhesins, cytotoxins, effectors, and hemolysins to better assess the pathogenic potential of the recovered STEC isolates. Important animal reservoirs are cattle and other small domestic ruminants. STEC can also be recovered from other carriers, such as mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, shellfish and insects. Finally, antimicrobial resistance in STEC is a matter of growing concern, supporting the need to monitor the use of these agents by private, public and agricultural sectors. Certain antimicrobials can induce Shiga toxin production and thus promote the onset of severe disease symptoms in humans. Together, this information will provide a better understanding of risks associated with STEC and will aid in the development of efficient and targeted intervention strategies."

The analysis of environmental samples by newer diagnostic techniques such as reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) amplification of nucleic acid has begun to identify human enteric viruses (predominantly ""Norwalk-like"" viruses [NLVs]) as the cause of many of these outbreaks. To streamline NLV detection from environmental samples such as shellfish, we have developed an RT-PCR-oligoprobe amplification and detection method using several new procedures that enable confirmed RT-PCR amplification and product detection in 1 day. The new steps include replacing reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase with rTth polymerase, a heat-stable enzyme that functions as both a reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase, in a single-tube, single-buffer, elevated temperature reaction. An internal standard Norwalk virus (NV) RNA control is added to each RT-PCR to identify sample inhibition, and thermolabile uracil N-glycosylase is incorporated into the reaction to prevent PCR product carryover contamination. Finally, RT-PCR-generated amplicons are detected in microtiter wells using virus-specific biotinylated oligoprobes in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based format. The DNA enzyme immunoassay is based on the capture of PCR product by biotinylated probes fixed onto individual streptavidin-coated wells. Using this method, low levels of NV were detected in stool and both NLV and hepatitis A virus were detected in bivalve mollusks following bioaccumulation. The method also successfully detected NLV in oysters implicated in an outbreak of NLV gastroenteritis. This method dramatically decreases the time needed for analysis and is amenable to automation."

Changes in the levels of pathogenic Vibrio spp. during wholesale and retail handling for 2 weeks postharvest were also monitored. On-board icing achieved temperature reductions in all sacks in accordance with the National Shellfish Sanitation Program standard, but dockside icing did not meet this standard. Based on one-way analysis of variance, the only statistically significant relationship between Vibrio levels and treatment occurred for samples harvested in August; in this case, the levels of V. vulnificus in the noniced oysters were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than were the levels in the samples iced on-board. When analyzing counts over the 14-day storage period, using factorial analysis, there were statistically significant differences in V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus levels by sample date and/or treatment (P < 0.05), but these relationships were not consistent. Treated (iced) oysters had significantly higher gaping (approximately 20%) after 1 week in cold storage than did noniced oysters (approximately 10%) and gaping increased significantly by day 14 of commercial storage.

OBJECTIVE:We sought to summarize the US Food and Drug Administration's records of recalls classified for fiscal year 1999 involving foods containing undeclared allergens. METHODS:Food and Drug Administration food recall records were reviewed for fiscal year 1999 to identify recalls that occurred because of the undeclared presence of one or more of the following allergens: milk, eggs, fish, wheat, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, and soy. Each record was reviewed to determine the recalled product, the undeclared allergen present, the reason for recall, and reported adverse events. RESULTS:Of 659 total food products classified for recall during fiscal year 1999, 236 (36%) products were recalled because they contained one or more undeclared allergens. Consumers were the party most often responsible for identifying that an undeclared allergen was present in a product (56% of recalled products). A total of 34 consumers reported allergic reactions after consumption of the recalled products. Three principal factors contributed to the presence of undeclared allergens in the recalled products: ingredient-statement omissions and errors (51% of all recalled products); manufacturing equipment cross-contact (40%); and errors by ingredient suppliers or manufacturing firm employees (5%). CONCLUSION:The presence of undeclared allergens in food products represents one of the more common reasons for food-product recall in the United States. A number of well-recognized allergens may be introduced into foods as a result of several different factors."

Individuals living in coastal communities around the Gulf of Mexico are particularly vulnerable to brevetoxins released by K. brevis in seawater and carried inland within marine aerosol. Exposure to K. brevis occurs during residential, recreational, and occupational activities and has been associated with upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms in healthy and medically vulnerable individuals. Additionally, ingestion of brevetoxin-contaminated seafood causes neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP), and severe headaches prompting emergency department visits which occur in excess during K. brevis blooms. The current study examined a dose-response relationship between K. brevis in coastal waters and URT and NSP-like symptoms and headaches among southwest Florida residents. Data on past medical history (PMH) and medical symptoms were collected from the participants (n = 258) in five southwest Florida counties between June 2019 to August 2021. A dose-response relationship was observed between K. brevis blooms and reporting of URT and NSP-like symptoms and headaches. Reporting of NSP-like symptoms was higher among participants with a PMH of migraines, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and mild memory loss, while the association of headaches with K. brevis blooms was accentuated among individuals with a PMH of migraines. These results suggest further investigations into the threshold of aerosolized brevetoxin dose required to elicit URT, headaches and/or NSP-like symptoms.

Although initially each toxin appeared in a determined geographical zone, nowadays many of them are found in multiple places worldwide. In addition, more toxic compounds (new toxins or new analogs of known toxins) are being isolated and identified, which bring about new risks for public health. An example of this situation is the group of azaspiracids (AZAs). Initially these toxins were concentrated in Irish coasts but today appear in many different geographic locations; in the first toxic episode only three analogs were isolated, but now it is known that the group is comprised of at least eleven identified compounds. A substantial problem associated with all these new toxins is the extreme difficulty associated with the study of their toxic effects and mechanisms of action due to the very small quantities of purified toxin available. Therefore, the study of procedures to isolate them from contaminated shellfish or to synthesize them is of tremendous importance. In this paper we design a complete procedure to obtain AZAs analogs from mussels contaminated with DSP toxins and azaspiracids by means of three consecutive steps: an extraction procedure to remove toxins from shellfish, a solid phase extraction (SPE) to clean the samples and separate DSP toxins and AZAs, and a preparative HPLC to isolate each analog.

They are widely distributed in coastal and offshore waters around the world. However, the persistence and photochemical degradation characteristics of DSP in an aqueous environment are still unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the photochemical fate of two representative DSP toxins, namely, okadaic acid (OA) and dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1). Results showed that photo-mediated chemical reactions play a crucial role in eliminating DSP toxins in seawater. However, the degradation of OA and DTX1 was relatively slow under natural solar radiation, with a removal efficiency of 90.0% after exposure for more than 20 days. When the reaction solutions of OA and DTX1 were exposed to Hg lamp radiation, their degradation followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, and was remarkably influenced by seawater pH and metal-ion concentration. A total of 24 tentative transformation products (TPs) of OA and DTX1 were identified via liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry. C12 (C43H66O11) and C24 (C44H68O11) were the main TPs. The following possible photodegradation pathways were proposed: decarboxylation, photoinduced hydrolysis, chain scission, and photo-oxidation. Toxicity assays via protein phosphatase 2A inhibition proved that photochemical processes could significantly reduce the DSP toxicity of irradiated solutions by approximately 88%. This work provides an enhanced understanding of the fate of DSP toxins in the aqueous environment, allowing for an improved assessment of their environmental impacts."

Six of those recalls took place in 2018. To understand this increase, fundamental information is needed on the relationship between S. enterica and oysters. The aims of this study were to address important data gaps concerning the levels of Salmonella in naturally contaminated oysters and the ability of this pathogen to survive in live oyster shellstock. Enumeration data were evaluated for five oyster and clam samples collected from the east coast of Canada from 2015 to 2018. The reported levels were <0.0015 to 0.064 most probable number per g of oyster tissue. The S. enterica isolates recovered from these animals belonged to serovars Typhimurium, Infantis, Enteritidis, and I 4,5:i:-. Filter feeding by the oysters was exploited to assess the Salmonella accumulation that would occur following a natural contamination event. Detectable levels of the pathogen were observed after 30 min of exposure and began to plateau at 60 min. A survival study in live oyster shellstock indicated that after 4 days of storage at ambient temperatures, the Salmonella level declined slightly from 4.3 to 3.7 log CFU/g. These data indicate that the levels of Salmonella found in naturally contaminated oysters are low and are not expected to increase between the point of harvest and the point of consumption. The changing ecology of shellfish environments requires continued monitoring and testing to safeguard public health. The data presented here will be useful for the evaluation and design of sampling plans and risk management approaches for the control of Salmonella in live oyster shellstock."

Consequently, shellfish represent a major vector for NoV entry into the human food chain, leading to gastrointestinal illness. Identification of areas suitable for the safe cultivation of shellfish requires an understanding of NoV behaviour upon discharge of municipal-derived sewage into coastal waters. This study exploited the potential of edible mussels (Mytilus edulis) to accumulate NoV and employed the ISO method for quantification of NoV within mussel digestive tissues. To evaluate the spatial spread of NoV from an offshore sewage discharge pipe, mesh cages of mussels were suspended from moorings deployed in a 9 km2 grid array around the outfall. Caged mussels were retrieved after 30 days and NoV (GI and GII), total coliforms and E. coli enumerated. The experimentally-derived levels of NoV GI and GII in mussels were similar with total NoV levels ranging from 7 × 101 to 1.6 × 104 genome copies g-1 shellfish digestive gland (ΣGI + GII). NoV spread from the outfall showed a distinct plume which matched very closely to predictions from the tidally-driven effluent dispersal model MIKE21. A contrasting spatial pattern was observed for coliforms (range 1.7 × 102 to 2.1 × 104 CFU 100 g-1 shellfish tissue) and E. coli (range 0-1.2 × 103 CFU 100 g-1 shellfish tissue).

This study documents the optimisation of the novel Microarrays for the Detection of Toxic Algae (MIDTAL) microarray from its initial stages to the final commercial version now available from Microbia Environnement (France). Existing oligonucleotide probes used in whole-cell fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) for Prymnesium species from higher group probes to species-level probes were adapted and tested on the first-generation microarray. The combination and interaction of numerous other probes specific for a whole range of phytoplankton taxa also spotted on the chip surface caused high cross reactivity, resulting in false-positive results on the microarray. The probe sequences were extended for the subsequent second-generation microarray, and further adaptations of the hybridisation protocol and incubation temperatures significantly reduced false-positive readings from the first to the second-generation chip, thereby increasing the specificity of the MIDTAL microarray. Additional refinement of the subsequent third-generation microarray protocols with the addition of a poly-T amino linker to the 5' end of each probe further enhanced the microarray performance but also highlighted the importance of optimising RNA labelling efficiency when testing with natural seawater samples from Killary Harbour, Ireland."

The model was developed using a database of FIO concentrations in seawater sampled at 50 sites and the validation was performed using a different database by comparing 288 pairs of measured and modelled results for 15 sites. The index of agreement between the model outputs and the FIO concentrations measured during the validation period was 66%; the mean average error was 0.43 log10 and the root mean square error was 0.58 log10 MPN.100mL-1. These validation results indicate that the model provides a fair representation of the FIO contamination in the bays for the meteorological conditions under which the model was trained. The simulation of different scenarios showed that under typical levels of resident human population in the catchments and median rainfall and solar radiation conditions, the median FIO concentration in the bays is 0.4 MPN.100mL-1. Under extreme meteorological conditions, the combined effect of high rainfall and low solar radiation increased FIO concentrations up to 5 log10 MPN.100mL-1. The simulated scenarios also show that increases in resident population during the summer tourist season and average rainfall concentrations do not increase median FIO concentrations in the bays relative to periods of time with average population, possibly because of higher bacterial die-off in the waters.

In this study, we explored the accumulative cardiotoxic potential of YTX in vitro and in vivo. Preliminary in vitro evaluation of cardiotoxicity was based on the effect on hERG (human ether-a-go-go related gene) channel trafficking. In vivo experiments were performed in rats that received repeated administrations of YTX followed by recordings of electrocardiograms, arterial blood pressure, plasmatic cardiac biomarkers, and analysis of myocardium structure and ultrastructure. Our results showed that an exposure to 100 nM YTX for 12 or 24 h caused an increase of extracellular surface hERG channels. Furthermore, remarkable bradycardia and hypotension, structural heart alterations, and increased plasma levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 were observed in rats after four intraperitoneal injections of YTX at doses of 50 or 70 μg/kg that were administered every 4 days along a period of 15 days. Therefore, and for the first time, YTX-induced subacute cardiotoxicity is supported by evidence of cardiovascular function alterations related to its repeated administration. Considering international criteria for marine toxin risk estimation and that the regulatory limit for YTX has been recently raised in many countries, YTX cardiotoxicity might pose a health risk to humans and especially to people with previous cardiovascular risk."

In humans, acute exposure causes a neurotoxic illness known as amnesic shellfish poisoning characterized by seizures, memory loss, coma and death. Regular monitoring for high DA levels in edible shellfish tissues has been effective in protecting human consumers from acute DA exposure. However, chronic low-level DA exposure remains a concern, particularly in coastal and tribal communities that subsistence harvest shellfish known to contain low levels of the toxin. Domoic acid exposure via consumption of planktivorous fish also has a profound health impact on California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) affecting hundreds of animals yearly. Due to increasing algal toxin exposure threats globally, there is a critical need for reliable diagnostic tests for assessing chronic DA exposure in humans and wildlife. Here we report the discovery of a novel DA-specific antibody response that is a signature of chronic low-level exposure identified initially in a zebrafish exposure model and confirmed in naturally exposed wild sea lions. Additionally, we found that chronic exposure in zebrafish caused increased neurologic sensitivity to DA, revealing that repetitive exposure to DA well below the threshold for acute behavioral toxicity has underlying neurotoxic consequences. The discovery that chronic exposure to low levels of a small, water-soluble single amino acid triggers a detectable antibody response is surprising and has profound implications for the development of diagnostic tests for exposure to other pervasive environmental toxins."

Tasmania's rock lobster fishery is one of the state's most important wild capture fisheries, supporting a significant commercial industry (AUD 97M) and recreational fishing sector. A comprehensive 8 years of field data collected across multiple sites has allowed continued improvements to the risk management program protecting public health and market access for the Tasmanian lobster fishery. High variability was seen in toxin levels between individuals, sites, months, and years. The highest risk sites were those on the central east coast, with July to January identified as the most at-risk months. Relatively high uptake rates were observed (exponential rate of 2% per day), similar to filter-feeding mussels, and meant that lobster accumulated toxins quickly. Similarly, lobsters were relatively fast detoxifiers, losing up to 3% PST per day, following bloom demise. Mussel sentinel lines were effective in indicating a risk of elevated PST in lobster hepatopancreas, with annual baseline monitoring costing approximately 0.06% of the industry value. In addition, it was determined that if the mean hepatopancreas PST levels in five individual lobsters from a site were <0.22 mg STX equiv. kg-1, there is a 97.5% probability that any lobster from that site would be below the bivalve maximum level of 0.8 mg STX equiv. kg-1. The combination of using a sentinel species to identify risk areas and sampling five individual lobsters at a particular site, provides a cost-effective strategy for managing PST risk in the Tasmanian commercial lobster fishery."

A mandatory routine monitoring of LSTs has been adopted for seafood products by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in many countries. In this study, two methods developed on liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) under acidic and alkaline chromatographic conditions were assessed for the determination of multiple LSTs. Different strategies including matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD), solid phase extraction (SPE) and sample dilution were applied and evaluated the matrix effects of mussel, scallop, clam, and oyster samples on the signal response of mass spectrometry. Results showed that the alkaline method achieved a lower limit of detection (LOD) and more robust compared to the acidic method. The obvious signal suppression of OA and DTX1 (55%-76%) and signal enhancement of PTX2 (27%-34%) occurred in the crude extracts of shellfish under acidic chromatography. In the alkaline method, no remarkable matrix effects of crude extracts were found except for the scallop matrix on the signal intensity of DTX1, AZA3 and GYM-A (121%-130%). Clean-up methods MSPD, SPE and sample dilution obviously reduced the inhibition of shellfish matrices on the signal response of OA and DTX1, however, which were still subject to signal inhibition under acidic condition. Sample dilution was more effective than SPE and MSPD in minimizing the matrix interference in both acidic and alkaline methods. Furthermore, sample dilution in combination with the alkaline chromatography was the most effective method. Bivalve mollusks harvested from Beibu Bay, South China Sea, were generally contaminated by GYM-A and SPX1 at low concentrations."

Identifying the source of microbial contamination (microbial source tracking) plays a dominant role in enabling effective management and remediation strategies. One method used to determine the source of the contamination is quantification of the ratio of the four subgroups of F+-specific RNA coliphages (family Leviviridae) in impacted water samples. Because of typically low concentrations in the environment, enrichment assays are performed prior to detection, even though differential replication rates have been reported. These assays are also compromised by differential loss of phage infectivity among subgroups after release into the environment, thus obscuring the initial ratio. Here, a culture-independent multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) protocol for the simultaneous quantification of all four subgroups of F+-specific RNA coliphages using novel primer sets and molecular beacons is presented. This assay is extremely sensitive, achieving detection with as few as 10 copies of isolated coliphage RNA, and is linear for a minimum of six orders of magnitude. During survival experiments, the real-time RT-PCR technique was able to quantify coliphages in seawater when culture-based double agar layer assay failed. While infectivity was lost at different rates at the subgroup level, decay constants in seawater, calculated using the real-time RT-PCR estimates, did not vary among subgroups. The accurate determination of the in situ concentration of F+-specific RNA coliphages using this method will facilitate more effective remediation strategies for impacted environments."

Understanding the various factors that influence the chemical burden of an individual is of critical importance to public health strategies. We investigated the relationships between socioeconomic status (SES) and bio-monitored chemical concentration in five cross-sectional waves of the U. S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We utilised adjusted linear regression models to investigate the association between 179 toxicants and the poverty income ratio (PIR) for five NHANES waves. We then selected a subset of chemicals associated with PIR in 3 or more NHANES waves and investigated potential mediating factors using structural equation modelling. PIR was associated with 18 chemicals in 3 or more NHANES waves. Higher SES individuals had higher burdens of serum and urinary mercury, arsenic, caesium, thallium, perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, mono(carboxyoctyl) phthalate and benzophenone-3. Inverse associations were noted between PIR and serum and urinary lead and cadmium, antimony, bisphenol A and three phthalates (mono-benzyl, mono-isobutyl, mono-n-butyl). Key mediators included fish and shellfish consumption for the PIR, mercury, arsenic, thallium and perfluorononanoic acid associations. Sunscreen use was an important mediator in the benzophenone-3/PIR relationship. The association between PIR and cadmium or lead was partially mediated by smoking, occupation and diet. These results provide a comprehensive analysis of exposure patterns as a function of socioeconomic status in US adults, providing important information to guide future public health remediation measures to decrease toxicant and disease burdens within society."

Both E. coli and V. cholerae densities declined by 2 orders of magnitude, as measured by direct particle counts with a Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics, Inc. , Hialeah, Fla. ). However, the density of neither bacteria changed dramatically when the same samples were analyzed by epifluorescent direct counts. Differences in the two direct count methods were accounted for by changes in cell morphology that occurred in both bacteria after exposure to seawater. Morphological changes occurred more rapidly in E. coli compared with those in V. cholerae. Bacteria in chambers exposed to sediment did not show significant changes in morphology and had only a slight decline in density. Physiological activity declined by more than 40% for both bacteria within 24 h. The decline in activity was less severe in the sediments. Tropical coral reef sands and turtle grass beds were shown to be less stressful environments for V. cholerae and E. coli than would have been predicted from temperature and microcosm studies. V. cholerae can survive the in situ conditions of a tropical coral reef and could become a source of bacterial contamination for fish and shellfish in this environment. The simultaneous monitoring of E. coli levels established that this bacteria can not be used as an indicator of V. cholerae or other fecal-borne pathogens in coral reef environments because of the greater stress these environments put on E. coli.

We reconstructed >40 000 partial viral genomes into 10 149 species-level groups, dominated by dsDNA and (+)ssRNA bacteriophages (Caudoviricetes and Leviviricetes) and a small number of genomes that could pose a risk to human health. We found substantial viral diversity and geographically distinct virus communities associated with different wastewater treatment plants. River and estuarine water bodies harboured more diverse viral communities in downstream locations, influenced by tidal movement and proximity to wastewater treatment plants. Shellfish and beach sand were enriched in viral communities when compared with the surrounding water, acting as entrapment matrices for virus particles. Extensive phylogenetic analyses of environmental-derived and reference sequences showed the presence of human-associated sapovirus GII in all sample types, multiple rotavirus A strains in wastewater and a diverse set of picorna-like viruses associated with shellfish. We conclude that wastewater-derived viral genetic material is commonly deposited in the environment and can be traced throughout the freshwater-marine continuum of the river catchment, where it is influenced by local geography, weather events and tidal effects.

Tissues and hemolymph were collected from M. edulis exposed for 14 days to either control (no added Cd, only seawater), or 50 µg/l Cd as CdCl2 in continuous or intermittent profile (2 day exposure, 2 days in clean seawater alternately); and sub-lethal responses examined using a suite of assays including total glutathione, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), neutral red retention, total hemocyte counts, hemolymph Na(+) and K(+), plasma glucose and histopathology. A time-dependent accumulation of the Cd was observed in tissues of mussels after continuous exposure, while the intermittent exposure showed step-wise changes in the hemolymph and gonad. Tissue Cd concentration in the continuous exposure was significantly increased (≥2 fold) for most tissues compared to the intermittent exposure. No clear differences were seen between the continuous and intermittent exposure for most end points measured apart from a 2 fold significant increase in hemocyte infiltration in the digestive gland of the continuous exposure compared to the intermittent exposure. Overall, the data showed that the Cd accumulation was generally greater in the continuous exposure regime, but despite this, most of the biological responses being similar in both regimes."

In this way, this review aimed to present an overview of HABs impacts on marine shellfish by evaluating the effects of cultivated molluscs exposure to microalgae and cyanobacteria that form blooms and/or synthesize toxins. More specifically, it was assessed the main molluscan shellfish responses to harmful algae, trophic transfer and dynamics of phycotoxins, and the risks for human health. Of the 2420 results obtained from literature search, 150 scientific publications were selected after thorough inspections for subject adherence. In total, 70 molluscan species and 37 taxa of harmful algae were assessed from retrieved scientific publications. A significant positive correlation was found between the marine production of molluscs and the number of available studies by molluscan category. Molluscan responses to HABs and phycotoxins were categorized and discussed in three sub-sections: effects on grazing and behavior, metabolic and physiological reactions, and fitness consequences. The main histopathological injuries and toxin concentrations in molluscan tissues were also compiled and discussed. Bivalves often accumulate more toxins than gastropods and cephalopods, occasionally exceeding recommended levels for safe consumption, representing a risk for human health. Harmful algae impact on molluscan shellfish are complex to trace and predict; however, considering the perspective of increase in the occurrence and intensity of HABs, the intensification of efforts to expand the knowledge about HABs impacts on marine molluscs is crucial to mitigate the damages on economy and human health."

Higher input of key nutrients, such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), can stimulate the growth of harmful algal species in freshwater, estuarine, and coastal marine ecosystems. Some HAB-forming taxa, particularly several cyanobacteria and dinoflagellate species, are harmful through the production of N-rich toxins that have detrimental effects on the environment and human health. Here, we test how changes in nutrient availability affect N-rich toxin synthesis in cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates using a meta-analysis approach. Overall, N-rich toxin content showed an increase with P limitation, while it tended to decrease with N limitation, but we also observed substantial variation in responses both within and across genera and toxin groups. For instance, in response to N limitation, microcystin content varied from a 297% decrease up to a 273% increase, and paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxin content varied from a 204% decrease to an 82% increase. Cylindrospermopsin, produced by N2-fixing cyanobacteria, showed no clear direction in response to nutrient limitation, and cellular contents of this compound may thus vary independently of nutrient fluctuations. Our results confirm earlier reported stoichiometric regulation of N-rich phytoplankton toxins, showing increased toxin content with an increase in cellular N:P ratios, and vice versa. Thus, changes in N-rich toxin content largely follow the changes in relative cellular N content. Consequently, although nutrient limitation may limit bloom biomass and thereby bloom toxicity, our results warn that P limitation can cause accumulation of cellular toxins and thus lead to unexpected increases in bloom toxicity."

The protozoan parasites Cryptosporidium spp. , Giardia duodenalis and Toxoplasma gondii have the potential to be transmitted in this way, and here we review the accumulating knowledge on the occurrence and survival of the transmission stages of these parasites in shellfish, whilst also emphasising the considerable gaps in our knowledge. Relevant information is particularly lacking for T. gondii, which, in comparison with Cryptosporidium spp. and G. duodenalis, has been relatively under-researched in this context. Although it seems evident that these shellfish can accumulate and concentrate all three of these parasites from the surrounding water, whether Giardia cysts remain viable and infectious is unknown, and some evidence suggests that they may be inactivated by the shellfish. Although both Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium apparently retain their infectivity for prolonged periods in shellfish, the actual public health threat posed by these parasites via these shellfish is unclear, largely because there is minimal evidence of infection transmission. Reasons for this apparent lack of infection transmission are discussed and it is recommended that the potential for transmission via shellfish consumption is recognised by those concerned with investigating transmission of these infections."

In contrast to the potential harm from Hg, Se is an essential element that is normally found in high levels in seafood. If the amount of Hg is high enough, it could bind Se and irreversibly inhibit selenium-dependent enzymes. Thus, adequate levels of Se need to be available to replace the amount of Se lost to Hg sequestration, thereby maintaining normal selenoprotein synthesis. Hg analysis was conducted using a flow injection analysis system coupled with an atomic adsorption spectrometer, and Se analysis was conducted using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Of the trace elements investigated, only Hg has a limit set by the European Community for human consumption, and this was never exceeded. Nevertheless, based on Target Hazard Quotient (THQ) over 1, and on the Estimated Daily Intake per meal (EDIm) higher than the Provisional Tolerable Intake (PTI) suggested by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additive (JECFA), Hg oral exposure derived from consumption of the benthonic fish and of the bigger pelagic fish species analyzed, could follow the occurrence of systemic effects. Se was found always in molar excess respect to Hg in all pelagic fish and in the shellfish, nearly equimolar in the benthonic fish. Determining the evidence that foods, such as pelagic fish, with high molar excess of Se, could contribute to replace the amount of Se bound to Hg and thereby maintaining normal selenoprotein synthesis, is useful for a better understanding of the seafood safety."

This study conducted on the south-central coast of Cuba reports the occurrence of Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa genera and the associated benthic genera Ostreopsis and Prorocentrum. Gambierdiscus/Fukuyoa cells were present at low to moderate abundances depending on the site and month of sampling. This genus was notably higher on Dictyotaceae than on other macrophytes. PCR analysis of field-collected samples revealed the presence of six different Gambierdiscus and one Fukuyoa species, including G. caribaeus, G. carolinianus, G. carpenteri, G. belizeanus, F. ruetzleri, G. silvae, and Gambierdiscus sp. ribotype 2. Only Gambierdiscus excentricus was absent from the eight Gambierdiscus/Fukuyoa species known in the wider Caribbean region. Eleven clonal cultures were established and confirmed by PCR and SEM as being either G. carolinianus or G. caribaeus. Toxin production in each isolate was assessed by a radioligand receptor binding assay and found to be below the assay quantification limit. These novel findings augment the knowledge of the ciguatoxin-source dinoflagellates that are present in Cuba, however further studies are needed to better understand the correlation between their abundance, species-specific toxin production in the environment, and the risk for fish contamination, in order to develop better informed ciguatera risk management strategies."

We describe here a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) assay specifically tailored to detect these viruses in environmental waters. The assay included a competitive internal positive control (CIPC) that allowed the inhibition of qRT-PCRs to be quantitatively assessed. Coamplification of the CIPC with enteroviral genetic material did not affect the sensitivity, specificity, or reproducibility of the enteroviral qRT-PCR assay. The assay is rapid (less than 5 h from sample to result), has a wide dynamic range (>3 logs), and is capable of detecting as few as 25 enteroviral genomes with an average amplification efficiency of 0.91. In samples with low or moderate inhibition, the delay in CIPC amplification was used to adjust enterovirus qRT-PCR concentrations to account for losses due to inhibition. Samples exhibiting significant inhibition were not corrected but instead diluted twofold and immediately assayed again. Using significantly inhibited samples, it was found that dilution relieved inhibition in 93% (25 of 27) of the samples. In addition, 15% (4 of 27) of these previously negative samples contained enteroviral genomes. The high-throughput format of the assay compared to conventional culture-based methods offers a fast, reliable, and specific method for detecting enteroviruses in environmental water samples. The ability of the assay to identify false negatives and provide improved quantitative assessments of enterovirus concentrations will facilitate the tracking of human fecal contamination and the assessment of potential public health risk due to enteroviruses in recreational and shellfish harvesting waters."

Recent research has demonstrated higher seafood consumption and subsequent increased risk of methylmercury exposure among subpopulations living in coastal areas. The identification of high concentrations of total mercury in blood and skin among resident Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), a coastal estuary in Florida, alerted us to a potential public health hazard in the contiguous human population. Therefore, we analyzed hair mercury concentrations of residents living along the IRL and ascertained their sources and patterns of seafood consumption. The total mean mercury concentration for 135 residents was 1.53 ± 1.89 µg/g. The concentration of hair mercury among males (2.02 ± 2.38 µg/g) was significantly higher than that for females (0.96 ± 0.74 µg/g) (p < 0.01). Log transformed hair mercury concentration was significantly associated with the frequency of total seafood consumption (p < 0.01). Individuals who reported consuming seafood once a day or more were 3.71 (95% CI 0.84-16.38) times more likely to have a total hair mercury concentration over 1.0 µg/g, which corresponds approximately to the U. S. EPA reference dose, compared to those who consumed seafood once a week or less. Hair mercury concentration was also significantly higher among individuals who obtained all or most of their seafood from local recreational sources (p < 0.01). The elevated human mercury concentrations mirror the elevated concentrations observed in resident dolphins in the same geographical region. The current study is one of the first to apply the concept of a sentinel animal to a contiguous human population."

The formation of DNA-carcinogen adducts is thought to be a necessary step in the action of most carcinogens. Recently, a variety of new fluorescence, immunochemical, and radioactive-postlabeling procedures have been developed that allow the sensitive measurement of DNA-carcinogen adducts in organisms exposed to environmental carcinogens. In some cases, similar procedures have been developed for protein-carcinogen adducts. In an organism with active metabolic systems for a given carcinogen, adducts are generally much longer lived than the carcinogens that formed them. Thus, the detection of DNA- or protein-carcinogen adducts in aquatic foodstuffs can act as an indicator of prior carcinogen exposure. The presence of DNA adducts would, in addition, suggest a mutagenic/carcinogenic risk to the aquatic organism itself. Vertebrate fish are characterized by high levels of carcinogen metabolism, low body burdens of carcinogen, the formation of carcinogen-macromolecule adducts, and the occurrence of pollution-related tumors. Shellfish, on the other hand, have low levels of carcinogen metabolism, high body burdens of carcinogen, and have little or no evidence of carcinogen-macromolecule adducts or tumors. The consumption of carcinogen adducts in aquatic foodstuffs is unlikely to represent a human health hazard. There are no metabolic pathways by which protein-carcinogen or DNA-carcinogen adducts could reform carcinogens. Incorporation via salvage pathways of preformed nucleoside-carcinogen adducts from foodstuffs into newly synthesized human DNA is theoretically possible. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

DA bioaccumulates in higher trophic levels and poses a threat to human health through amnesic shellfish poisoning. Laboratory experiments using a DA reference standard demonstrated that mild turbulence facilitates formation of organic polymer aggregates >0.6 µm in-vivo that can scavenge dissolved DA (dDA). Using A. tonsa, we demonstrate that DA can be assimilated through consumption of these organic polymers which scavenged dDA -a pathway which does not require direct ingestion of the toxin-producer Pseudo-nitzschia. In filtered seawater with spiked DA, copepods accumulated 24.8 ± 4.7 pg DA copepod-1 (2.1 ppm) on average by consuming organic polymers. This was validated in one out of five experiments using ambient DA concentrations. Copepods were suspended in particle-free seawater and accumulated 14.4 ± 3.8 pg DA copepod-1 (1.20 ppm), and in particle-concentrated seawater they accumulated 40.9 ± 3.8 pg DA copepod-1 (3.42 ppm).

This experiment had the highest Pseudo-nitzschia spp. abundance (~225,000 cells L - 1) and cellular toxin quota, up to 0.88 pg DA cell-1, relative to the other four ambient DA experiments. These results demonstrate the potential for DA to enter the marine food web through an alternate pathway and may have considerable implications to understanding the flow of DA through marine food webs, and how we monitor DA and its potential vectors into the food web."

Considering the impacts of political changes, we note the indirect engagement sometimes required for continued participation in international coordination programs. As an example, we highlight how lessons learned from a Native-led toxin monitoring and testing program (the Southeast Alaska Tribal Ocean Research partnership) can inform programs in other settings. We also describe how international knowledge is mutually valuable for this program in Southeast Alaska."

There are fish and shellfish consumption advisories in the New York-New Jersey harbor estuary, particularly in the waters of the Newark Bay Complex. This paper examines fishing behavior, consumption patterns, and the reasons that people fish in the Newark Bay Complex. I test the null hypotheses that there are no differences among Asians, Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites in consumption patterns for fish and crabs and in the reasons that they fish or crab. Most people either fished or crabbed, but not both. People who fish and crab ate more grams of crab than fish in a given meal; people who crab only consumed more grams of crab at a meal than those who fish only consumed of fish. Although 30% or more of the people who fished and crabbed in the Newark Bay Complex did not eat their self-caught fish or crabs 8-25% of the people ate more than 1500 g/month. Some people angling in the Newark Bay Complex are eating crabs at a rate well over 1500 g/month, and about 70% are eating crabs even though there is a total ban on both harvest and consumption because of the health risks from dioxin. Consumption patterns were negatively correlated with mean income and positively correlated with mean age. Most people rated relaxation and being outdoors the highest reasons for angling, although on an open-ended question they usually listed recreation. There were no ethnic differences in reasons for angling, although other studies have shown ethnic differences in consumption. Obtaining fish or crabs to eat, give away, trade, or sell were rated low, suggesting that consumption advisories fail partly because people are not primarily fishing for food."

As such, data on exposure sources and contaminant body burden concentrations is critical in the development of effective public health policies and interventions in support of newcomer health. We conducted a scoping review to gather evidence on important toxic metals of health concern, lead (Pb), mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd), and their concentrations and potential exposure sources among newcomer women. An initial 420 articles were identified through the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus, many reporting by ethnicity rather than newcomer/immigrant status. Several articles reported metal concentrations for other biomarkers but did not include blood, nor stratify results. From the remainder, we selected a total of 10 articles for full textual review, which reported blood Pb, Hg or Cd levels for newcomer women and/or stratified blood metal results according to foreign birth or country of origin. Three of the articles reported higher Pb, Hg and Cd concentrations in newcomer women compared to their native-borne counterparts. Exposures identified as contributing to elevated Pb, Hg and Cd blood concentrations included: pica behaviour, the use of lead-glazed cookware or eye cosmetics, and fish/shellfish consumption. The review revealed a limited availability of data on metal body burden concentrations, exposure sources and routes among newcomer women specifically. More research is needed to better understand the extent to which newcomer women are disproportionately at risk of elevated metal exposures due to either country of origin or current exposures and to inform relevant, multi-national risk management strategies."

The European Commission asked EFSA for a scientific opinion on the risks to public health related to the presence of TTX and TTX analogues in marine bivalves and gastropods. The Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain reviewed the available literature but did not find support for the minimum lethal dose for humans of 2 mg, mentioned in various reviews. Some human case reports describe serious effects at a dose of 0.2 mg, corresponding to 4 μg/kg body weight (bw). However, the uncertainties on the actual exposure in the studies preclude their use for derivation of an acute reference dose (ARfD). Instead, a group ARfD of 0.25 μg/kg bw, applying to TTX and its analogues, was derived based on a TTX dose of 25 μg/kg bw at which no apathy was observed in an acute oral study with mice, applying a standard uncertainty factor of 100. Estimated relative potencies for analogues are lower than that of TTX but are associated with a high degree of uncertainty. Based on the occurrence data submitted to EFSA and reported consumption days only, average and P95 exposures of 0.00-0.09 and 0.00-0.03 μg/kg bw, respectively, were calculated. Using a large portion size of 400 g bivalves and P95 occurrence levels of TTX, with exception of oysters, the exposure was below the group ARfD in all consumer groups. A concentration below 44 μg TTX equivalents/kg shellfish meat, based on a large portion size of 400 g, was considered not to result in adverse effects in humans. Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) methods are the most suitable for identification and quantification of TTX and its analogues, with LOQs between 1 and 25 μg/kg."

The overall health value of different fish and shellfish items depends on concentrations of multiple nutrients (e. g. , selenium (Se), omega-3 fatty acids) and contaminants (e. g. , mercury (Hg)). However, few studies have examined the connections between human exposure to multiple nutrients and contaminants and the consumption of specific types of seafood. Our goals were to compare 1) Hg, Se and omega-3 fatty acid concentrations (Hg-nutrient signatures) among common fish and shellfish items and 2) Hg-nutrient signatures in the blood of avid seafood consumers, based on seafood consumption habits. We compiled nutrient and Hg concentration data for common fish and shellfish items from the literature. We also measured blood concentrations of Hg and seafood nutrients collected from adult, avid seafood consumers on Long Island, NY. Canonical discriminant analyses revealed distinct Hg-nutrient signatures among seafood items, and these signatures were reflected in the blood of consumers based on different consumption habits. For example, consumers with a salmon-dominated seafood diet had relatively high percentage of omega-3 fatty acids in blood, and consumers who tend to eat top predator seafood have higher Hg, but similar blood nutrient concentrations compared to consumers who tend to eat low trophic level seafood. These results provide direct evidence of links between the ecological characteristics of the type of seafood consumed and Hg-nutrient exposure. This approach helps assess the overall human health value of specific seafood types, leads to specific diet recommendations, and can be used to characterize risk:benefit status among seafood consumers."

Although some studies have been performed on the behavior of weapons' fallout-derived 55Fe in the environment and subsequent impact on humans, little has been published on the behavior of 55Fe released as a point source discharge from nuclear sites. This study presents data on the concentration and temporal variation of 55Fe in fucoid seaweeds, shellfish, crab, and lobster collected from Weymouth Bay and adjacent coastal areas, southern England. These areas have received authorized discharges of radionuclides originating from the operation of a now-decommissioned steam-generating, heavy water-type reactor at AEE Winfrith. The highest activities of 55Fe are found associated with marine sediments collected near the discharge pipeline and a rapid decline occurs away from the pipeline. This is consistent with rapid sorption of 55Fe by the sediment, and the data show there is only limited reworking and remobilization. Activities of 55Fe in biota generally decreased over time, due to a reduction in the amount of 55Fe discharged. The variation of 55Fe activity, revealed from the monthly sampling of seaweed, does not reflect the short-term fluctuations seen in the patterns of discharged 55Fe activity. Although discharges of 55Fe from AEE Winfrith exceeded other radionuclides, the radiological impact on local seafood consumers is considerably less than for other key radionuclides such as 60Co and 65Zn but of comparable magnitude to the global average population dose arising from fallout-derived 55Fe."

The aims of this work were to characterize the toxin profile of the species and gain structural information on azaspiracids produced by the A. dexteroporum strain SZN-B848 isolated from the Gulf of Naples. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses were carried out on three MS systems having different ion source geometries (ESI, TurboIonSpray®, ESI ION MAX) and different MS analyzers operating either at unit resolution or at high resolution, namely a hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap (Q-Trap MS), a time of flight (TOF MS), and a hybrid linear ion trap Orbitrap XL Fourier transform mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap XL FTMS). As a combined result of these different analyses, A. dexteroporum showed to produce AZA-35, previously reported from Azadinium spinosum, and six compounds that represent new additions to the AZA-group of toxins, including AZA-54 to AZA-58 and 3-epiAZA-7, a stereoisomer of the shellfish metabolite AZA-7. Based on the interpretation of fragmentation patterns, we propose that all these molecules, except AZA-55, have the same A to I ring system as AZA-1, with structural modifications all located in the carboxylic side chain. Considering that none of the azaspiracids produced by the Mediterranean strain of A. dexteroporum is currently regulated by European food safety authorities, monitoring programs of marine biotoxins in the Mediterranean area should take into account the occurrence of the new analogues to avoid an underestimation of the AZA-related risk for seafood consumers.

Comparing with the FFA profile of shellfish in the control groups, overexpression of some FFAs occurred in the tissues of shellfish exposed to GYM-A in the experimental groups, which suggested that biosynthesis of FFAs was affected by the accumulation and metabolism of GYM-A in bivalves. Multiple fatty acids including some valuably nutritional FFAs such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were consumed in the esterification metabolism of GYM-A, which hinted that the lipid metabolism and nutritional quality of shellfish affected by the contamination of GYMs should be explored and assessed in future works."

To date, there is no data regarding the exposure levels of pregnant women to PCBs and OCPs in Shanghai. In order to evaluate PCB and OCP exposure levels and the contribution of dietary habits to these levels, we determined the concentrations of 8 PCBs and 14 OCPs in the umbilical cord blood serum of healthy pregnant women in Shanghai. Dietary habits of the pregnant women were obtained from a self-administered questionnaire. Results showed that p, p'-DDE, HCB and β-HCH were the major pollutants present in the serum samples; PCBs were detected in a few samples at low concentrations. Age, weight and body mass index before delivery were positively associated with serum levels of p, p'-DDE and β-HCH. Women and their husbands who had higher education levels, higher income levels, tended to have higher levels of p, p'-DDE and β-HCH. Spearman correlation analysis results suggested that consumption of foods such as milk, eggs, meat, fish, and shrimp may contribute to higher serum levels of p, p'-DDE and β-HCH. Furthermore, multiple linear regression analyses indicated that the age and educational levels of the pregnant women and their intake of fried/flamed food and shellfish were positively associated with β-HCH levels, and that the age and educational levels of the pregnant women and their intake of parity, beef, pork, mutton, and shrimp were positively associated with p, p'-DDE levels.

Modelled oceanographic conditions were studied and used to help understand observed changes in the chemical and biological patterns from the national biotoxins and phytoplankton monitoring program. The study focused on two toxic events in 2013. An upwelling event was predicted by the model prior to the appearance and population increase of potentially toxic diatoms, Pseudo-nitzschia, and associated domoic acid in shellfish. A downwelling episode was provided as a forecast in the model prior to the arrival of a Dinophysis bloom and detection of its associated biotoxins in Bay shellfish. The modelled forecast products developed included expected surface, mid-depth and bottom current pathways at the mouth of the Bay and on the adjacent shelf. The rate and direction of water volume flow at the mouth and mid-bay sections were produced by the model to examine predicted upwelling and downwelling pulses. The model also calculated the evolution of water properties (temperature, salinity and density) with depth along the Bay axis and on the adjacent continental shelf. Direct measurements of water properties at a fixed point, mid-bay, were comparable to model calculations. The operational model for southwest Ireland produces a reliable 3-day physical hydrodynamic forecast of the dominant regional physical processes that result in water exchange events between Bantry Bay and its adjacent shelf. While simulated physical hydrodynamics were provided as a 3-day forecast, the upwelling and downwelling signals from the model, closely linked to toxic HAB episodes, were evident up to 10 days prior to the contamination of shellfish in the Bay."

This risk is routinely managed by monitoring programs in shellfish producing areas, however the methods used to detect these harmful marine microbes are not usually automated nor conducted onsite, and are often expensive and require specialized expertise. Here we designed a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay based on the ITS-5.8S ribosomal region of Dinophysis spp. and evaluated its specificity, efficiency, and sensitivity to detect species belonging to this genus. We designed and tested twenty sets of primers pairs using three species of Dinophysis - D. caudata, D. fortii and D. acuminata. We optimized a qPCR assay using the primer pair that sufficiently amplified each of the target species (Dacu_11F/Dacu_11R), and tested this assay for cross-reactivity with other dinoflagellates and diatoms in the laboratory (11 species) and in silico 8 species (15 strains) of Dinophysis, 3 species of Ornithocercus and 2 species of Phalacroma. The qPCR assay returned efficiencies of 92.4% for D. caudata, 91.3% for D fortii, and 91.5% for D. acuminata, while showing no cross-reactivity with other phytoplankton taxa. Finally, we applied this assay to a D. acuminata bloom which occurred in an oyster producing estuary in south eastern Australia, and compared cell numbers inferred by qPCR to those determined by microscopy counts (max abund. ∼6.3 × 103 and 5.3 × 103 cells L-1 respectively).

Seafood consumption is thought to be an underappreciated source of PFAS exposure in the general population. This review synthesizes the current understanding of PFAS occurrence in shellfish, a term used to describe animals such as mollusk bivalves, certain gastropods (snails), cephalopods (e. g. , octopuses and squid), and crustaceans, and highlights scientific gaps relative to bioaccumulation and the protection of shellfish consumers. A range of sampling methodologies are used across studies, and the suite of PFAS surveyed across studies is highly variable. Concentrations of PFAS observed in shellfish vary by geographic location, shellfish species, habitat, and across PFAS compounds, and studies informing estimates of bioaccumulation of PFAS in shellfish are extremely limited at this time. This review identifies several important opportunities for researchers to standardize PFAS sampling techniques, sample preparation, and analytical methodologies to allow for better comparison of PFAS analytes both within and across future studies. Increasing the range of geographic locations where samples are collected is also a critical priority to support a greater knowledge of worldwide PFAS contamination. When put into the context of risk to consumer, concentrations of PFAS, especially PFOS, found in shellfish collected from sites containing aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) and industrial contamination may present risks to frequent consumers. Further research is needed to protect shellfish consumers and to inform shellfish advisories and health protective policies."

Oral gavage or intravenous administration to adult rats and digital autoradiographic analyses revealed the biodistribution and toxicokinetics of [3H]-PnTx-G, which is rapidly cleared from blood, and accumulates in the liver and small intestine. The labeling of peripheral and brain adult/embryo rat tissues highlights its ability to cross the intestinal, blood-brain and placental barriers. High-resolution 3D-imaging and in vitro competition studies on rat embryo sections revealed the specificity of [3H]-PnTx-G binding and its selectivity for muscle and neuronal nAChR subtypes (such as α7 subtype).

Our data showed that all along the 2-days exposure to A. minutum, king scallops exhibited transient lower filtration and respiration rates and accumulated PST. Significant inter-individual variability of toxin accumulation potential was observed among individuals. Furthermore, we found that ingestion of toxic algae, correlated to toxin accumulation was driven by two factors: 1/ the time it takes king scallop to recover from filtration inhibition and starts to filtrate again, 2/ the filtration level to which king scallop starts again to filtrate after inhibition. Furthermore, at the end of the 2-day exposure to A. minutum, proteomic analyzes revealed an increase of the killer cell lectin-like receptor B1, involved in adaptative immune response. Proteins involved in detoxification and in metabolism were found in lower amount in A. minutum exposed king scallops. Proteomic data also showed differential accumulation in several structure proteins such as β-actin, paramyosin and filamin A, suggesting a remodeling of the mantle tissue when king scallops are subjected to an A. minutum exposure."

A progressive reduction of viral contamination was evident during the first trimester of the monitoring, with prevalence decreasing from 78.8% in the first month, to 37.8% in the second and 3.9% in the third and quantitative levels reduced from an average value of 672 genome copies/g to 255 genome copies/g over a period of 4 weeks (virus half-life: 21.5 days).

The statistical analysis of the results per shellfish species and per production area showed that there were limited differences in contamination prevalence and levels among diverse bivalve species, while a statistically significant difference was present in quantitative levels of one production area. These data could be useful for the development of both risk assessment models and code of practice for the management of viral contamination in primary production."

A strategy based on the chemically unique nature of the C20 beta-amino acid, (2S,3S,8S,9S)-3-amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyldeca-4,6- dienoic acid (Adda), portion of the microcystins was used in conjunction with a protein phosphatase (PPase) assay to analyse for both covalently bound microcystins and free microcystins in the mussel tissues. The mussel PPase assay results were compared with the Lemieux oxidation gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis. Less than 0.1% of the total microcystin burden in the mussel tissue was found to be extractable with MeOH. Thus, direct evidence was provided for the existence of covalently bound microcystins in mussel tissues in vivo. The mussels rapidly cleared the covalently bound microcystins when transferred to untreated seawater. Within 4 days the total microcystin burden dropped from a high of 336.9 (+/- 45.8) micrograms/g wet tissue to 11.3 (+/- 2.6) micrograms/g. After 4 days postexposure until completion of the experiment the total levels remained below the detection limits of the GCMS method. The levels of free microcystins, extracted with MeOH and detected by the PPase assay, fell from 204 ng/g wet tissue to a residual 14 ng/g over a 53 day postexposure period. Presumably the bound microcystin present in the mussel tissue exists as a covalent complex with the PP-1 and PP-2A enzymes. We conclude that in any shellfish monitoring program it is the total tissue microcystin burden that needs to be considered."

There are only few studies on microplastic (MPs) pollution in estuaries. In this study, investigating the spatiotemporal variations of MPs in water, sediment and biota samples of 19 estuaries in Tamil Nadu, India, we assessed the chemical and human exposure risks of MPs. MPs extracted by digestion and density separation and characterized them using microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive analysis of X-rays. MP abundancesin summer and monsoon range from 31.7 ± 3.8 to 154.7 ± 4.2 items/L in water and 51.7 ± 3.6 to 171.4 ± 9.1 items/kg in sediment. Highest MPs abundance is found in water and sediment of the urbanized Adayar estuary. MP levels are higher in monsoon than in summer (P < 0.05) due to the discharge of wastewater via storm water outlets. More small-size MPs are found in summer (<0.5-1 mm) while monsoon has a greater diversity of MP polymers (MPDII: 0.81). MP abundance in fish varies from 0.01 ± 0.003 to 0.15 ± 0.03 items/g, and in shellfish from 0.75 ± 0.12 to 9.7 ± 0.28 items/g. In fish, more MPs are found in intestine than in gill or muscle. Shell fishes contain more MPs than fishes. In all the matrices, fibers of different sizes, and polymers of polyethylene and polypropylene are commonly found. An average local person is likely to ingest 781 items of MPs via fish and 2809 items via shellfish annually. Polymer hazard index shows hazard levels of IV to V indicating the serious MP pollution trend, which poses a risk to the biota. In conclusion, MPs observed in this study show that estuaries are a major pathway for land-derived plastics to reach the ocean. The results will help implement remedial/clean-up measures for the estuary for better ecosystem conservation."

Fecal-indicator quality standards based on Escherichia coli are well established in Europe and elsewhere. However, norovirus outbreaks after consumption of shellfish meeting these standards still occur, and the need to improve consumer health protection is well recognized. Alternative approaches proposed include direct monitoring of viral pathogens and the use of alternative indicator organisms capable of providing a better indication of virus risk. This study applies a recently developed TaqMan PCR assay to assess norovirus contamination in shellfish. Comparison was made with E. coli as the existing sanitary standard and a male-specific RNA bacteriophage as a possible alternative. Two commercial pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) harvesting areas were monitored over a 31-month period. The results show peaks of norovirus contamination in both areas during winter months, with average levels approximately 17 times higher in oysters sampled October to March than during the remainder of the year, consistent with epidemiological data for the United Kingdom showing oyster-associated illness is confined to winter months. While there was no apparent association with E. coli, an association between levels of norovirus contamination and the male-specific RNA bacteriophage was noted, with average norovirus levels over 40 times higher in samples with male-specific RNA bacteriophage counts of >1,000 PFU/100 g than in samples with <100 PFU/100 g.

There is nonetheless concern that residual levels of okadaic acid, a known tumor promoter that is the main toxin present in French coastal waters, might increase the risk of cancer among regular shellfish consumers. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an ecological study linking digestive cancer mortality rates with a proxy measure of contamination by DSP toxins in 59 coastal areas. Observed and expected numbers of deaths (using national rates as the reference) were computed by sex, cause of death, and area for two time periods: 1984-1988 and 1989-1993. The level of contamination in each area was estimated by the total number of weeks since monitoring began that production was shut down because of DSP toxin contamination. Using both Poisson regressions and test for trends of standardized mortality ratios across four exposure categories, we found some evidence of associations for several digestive cancer sites (esophagus, stomach, colon, liver, and total digestive cancers for men; stomach and pancreatic cancers for women). Among men, the only statistically significant result that remained after taking possible confounding by alcohol use into account involved colon cancer. The conclusions provided by this analysis are very tentative; they need to be reproduced and interpreted in the light of additional information on the potential long-term effects of DSP toxins. In the absence of human data, they provide some indication of a possible association between exposure to DSP toxins and digestive cancers."

Until recently it was difficult to assess viral contamination and the potential impact on public health. Risk assessment is a valuable tool which can be used to estimate adverse effects associated with microbial hazards. This report describes the use of quantitative risk assessment for evaluating potential human health impacts associated with exposure to viral contamination of shellfish. The four fundamental steps used in a formal risk assessment are described within and include i) Hazard identification, ii) Dose-response determination, iii) Exposure assessment, and iv) Risk characterization. Dose-response models developed from human feeding studies were used to evaluate the risk of infection from contaminated shellfish. Of 58 pooled samples, 19% were found to be positive for viruses. Using an echovirus-12 probability model, the individual risk was determined for consumption of 60 g of raw shellfish. Individual risks ranged from 2.2 × 10-4 to 3.5 × 10-2. These data suggest that individuals consuming raw shellfish from approved waters in the United States may have on the average a 1 in 100 chance of becoming infected with an enteric virus. Using the rotavirus model which represents a more infectious virus, the risk rose to 5 in 10. The potential for use of a risk assessment approach for developing priorities and strategies for control of disease is immense. Epidemiological data have demonstrated the significance of shellfish-associated viral disease and, although limited, appropriate virus occurrence data are available. Additional information on virus occurrence and exposure is needed, and then scientific risk assessment can be used to better assure the safety of seafood."

Shellfish samples included raft-cultured and wild mussels, as well as wild clams and cockles. Bacterial counts showed that the majority of samples (40.8%) could be classified as moderately polluted following the EU standards, and therefore should undergo depuration processes. However, differences in bacterial contamination were observed between cultured mussel and wild shellfish. Thus, percentage of clean samples (<230 EC/100 g shellfish) was clearly higher in cultured mussels (49.1%) than in wild mussels (22.8%) or clams and cockles (10.7%). HAV was detected in 27.4% and EV in 43.9% of the samples that were analyzed. Simultaneous detection of both viral types occurred in 14.1% of the samples. Statistical tests of dependence (chi-square test) showed no relationship either between viral and bacterial contamination, or between the presence of HAV and EV. Comparative analysis of hybridization and RT-PCR for viral detection yielded different results depending on the virus type that was studied, RT-PCR being effective for HAV but not for EV detection. The obtained results reinforce once again the inadequacy of bacteriological standards to assess viral contamination and suggest that although virological analysis of shellfish is possible by molecular techniques, interlaboratory standardization and validation studies are needed before the routine use in monitoring shellfish microbiological safety."

The upper percentile estimates of fish and shellfish intakes based on the 30-day daily averages were lower than those based on two- and three-day daily averages. These results support previous findings that distributions of ""usual"" intakes based on a small number of consumption days provide overestimates in the upper percentiles.

Their occurrence has been increased in frequency and severity, suggesting a worldwide public health risk. Marine biotoxins can accumulate in bivalve molluscs and regulatory limits have been set for some classes according to European Union legislation. These compounds can be distinguished in water- and fat-soluble molecules. The first group involves those of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning and Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning, whereas the toxins soluble in fat can cause Diarrheic Shellfish Poisoning and Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning. Due to the lack of long-term toxicity studies, establishing tolerable daily intakes for any of these marine biotoxins was not possible, but an acute reference dose can be considered more appropriate, because these molecules show an acute toxicity. Dietary exposure assessment is linked both to the levels of marine biotoxins present in bivalve molluscs and the portion that could be eaten by consumers. Symptoms may vary from a severe gastrointestinal intoxication with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps to neurological disorders such as ataxia, dizziness, partial paralysis, and respiratory distress. The official method for the detection of marine biotoxins is the mouse bioassay (MBA) showing some limits due to ethical restrictions and insufficient specificity. For this reason, the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method has replaced MBA as the reference technique.

Their toxin composition profiles were also determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). All eight strains clustered in the phylogenetic tree with A. pseudogonyaulax, A. affine, and A. tamiyavanichii from other locations, forming three well-resolved groups. The intraspecific genetic distances of the three Alexandrium species were significantly smaller than interspecific genetic distances for Alexandrium species. Beibu Gulf isolates were therefore classified as A. pseudogonyaulax, A. affine, and A. tamiyavanichii. No PSTs were identified in A. pseudogonyaulax, but low levels of gonyautoxins (GTXs) 1 to 5, and saxitoxin (STX) were detected in A. tamiyavanichii (a total of 4.60 fmol/cell). The extremely low level of toxicity is inconsistent with PST detection above regulatory levels on multiple occasions within the Beibu Gulf, suggesting that higher toxicity strains may occur in those waters, but were unsampled. Other explanations including biotransformation of PSTs in shellfish and the presence of other PST-producing algae are also suggested. Understanding the toxicity and phylogeny of Alexandrium species provides foundational data for the protection of public health in the Beibu Gulf region and the mitigation of HAB events."

The regulatory level of 0.8 mg of saxitoxin (STX) eq/kg in place for bivalve shellfish fisheries is applied to lobster hepatopancreas during blooms of toxic algae, resulting in harvest closures and ongoing risk management implications for the fishery. This cooking study was undertaken to inform a human health risk assessment, in conjunction with studies on the uptake and elimination of PST in J. edwardsii. Live lobsters in tanks were contaminated through consumption of PST-containing mussels harvested during an Alexandrium tamarense Group 1 bloom event. This resulted in a mean lobster hepatopancreas level of 2.83 ± 0.84 mg of STX·2HCl eq/kg. Other edible tissues contained negligible concentrations of toxin. PST concentrations in all tissues did not significantly change after boiling or steaming, although the amount of hepatopancreas available for consumption did decrease significantly with both cooking methods, because the tissue became more dispersed, resulting in an overall reduction in the toxin exposure per hepatopancreas consumed. The toxin profile was dominated by STX; gonyautoxin 2, 3; N-sulfocarbamoyl-gonyautoxin 2, 3 (C1,2); and gonyautoxin 5. No significant changes to the toxin profile were observed after either of the cooking methods. Pâté, bisque, and soufflé prepared from the hepatopancreas of toxic lobsters contained negligible levels of PST in each serving; on average, a serving of pâté contained 0.01 mg of STX·2HCl eq, whereas a serving of bisque or soufflé contained <0.01 mg of STX·2HCl eq. The findings of this study will inform a risk assessment of PST in J. edwardsii to determine risk management options for this fishery in Australia."

It is unknown if microbial pathogens and microparasites can subsequently be transmitted via concomitant predation to their consumers, including shorebirds. The objective of this study was to assess if pathogens associated with C. edule could be detected seasonally in the faeces of shorebirds that feed on C. edule and in the physical environment (sediment) in which C. edule reside, along the Irish and Celtic Seas. Two potentially pathogenic global groups, Vibrio and Haplosporidia, were detected in C. edule. Although Haplosporidia were not detected in the bird faeces nor in the sediment, identical strains of Vibrio splendidus were detected in C. edule and bird faecal samples at sites where the oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus and other waders were observed to be feeding on cockles. Vibrio spp. prevalence was seasonal and increased in C. edule and bird faecal samples during the warmer months, possibly due to higher seawater temperatures that promote the replication of this bacteria. The sediment samples showed an overall higher prevalence of Vibrio spp. than the bird faecal and C. edule samples, and its detection remained consistently high through the sites and throughout the seasons, which further supports the role of the sediment as a Vibrio reservoir. Our findings shed light on the fact that not all pathogen groups are transmitted from prey to predator via feeding but bacteria such as V. splendidus can be. As most of the wading birds observed in this study are migratory, the results also indicate the potential for this bacterium to be dispersed over greater geographic distances, which will have consequences for areas where it may be introduced."

The emergence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus as an important cause of epidemic summer diarrhea in 2004 and 2005, confined mainly to the tenth region in Chile, could be a manifestation of this trend. This and other areas of the country have also experienced several outbreaks of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), diarrheal shellfish poisoning (DSP) and amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) caused by harmful algal blooms (HAB) of Alexandrium catenella, Dinophysis acuta and Pseudonitzchia species, respectively. The short historical record of these pathological phenomena in Chile suggests that they are increasing in frequency and expanding their geographical range. The V parahaemolyticus isolates responsible for the Chilean outbreaks correspond mainly to the pandemic strain O3:K6. HAB found in Chile and the intoxications caused by them have similar biological characteristics to those described in other areas of the world. The tenth region, the area where these problems are emerging, produces approximately 80-90% of the shellfish consumed in Chile and a large proportion of the shellfish that is exported. Prevention of these public health problems can be attained by developing policies that increase environmental surveillance for Vibrios and toxic algae, improve the epidemiological surveillance of acute diarrhea and algal intoxications after the ingestion of raw bivalves, and educate the population on the mode of transmission of these diseases. Scientific capacity and laboratories need to be developed to widen the limited knowledge of the biology of Vibrio and toxic algae and the environmental factors that favor their emergence as public health and economic problems in Chile."

While all three pathogens have been detected in commercial shellfish, there is currently no standard approach for detecting protozoan parasites in shellfish. Common molecular and microscopic methods are limited in the number of pathogens they can simultaneously detect and are often targeted at one or two of these pathogens. Previously, we developed and validated a novel 18S amplicon-based next-generation sequencing assay for simultaneous detection of Cryptosporidium spp. , Giardia spp. and T. gondii in shellfish. In this study, we applied the assay for protozoan pathogen detection in wild oysters from Prince Edward Island (PEI). Oysters were harvested from restricted and prohibited areas, classified by the Canadian government according to fecal coliform counts in surrounding waters, and different fractions (whole tissue homogenate and hemolymph) were analyzed. Protozoan DNA was detected using metabarcoding in 28%, of oysters tested (N = 128), and the pathogen read counts in oyster homogenate were considerably higher than those in hemolymph. Protozoan read count thresholds were established for classifying probable oyster contamination with pathogens to account for low levels of background protozoan reads detected in negative controls. Assay results showed protozoan contamination was not associated with harvesting site classifications, suggesting that using fecal indicators for ensuring food safety may be insufficient. Due to the complex matrix, an oyster DNA reduction step may further improve the pathogen detection sensitivity of the assay. Results from this study affirm that novel metabarcoding is a promising screening tool for detection of protozoan pathogens in shellfish."

Descriptive analysis of reported clusters in France, microbiological analysis of stool and oyster samples, genotyping of noroviruses and an environmental investigation of the Etang de Thau were carried out. A retrospective cohort study was also undertaken among those attending a number of family meals in Paris. Thirteen family clusters in four districts of France (69 cases) could be attributed to the consumption of Thau oysters based on descriptive evidence. Oysters distributed at an office in Paris and consumed at fourteen family meals between 19 and 24 December led to a further outbreak. In this outbreak the attack rate was 21/36 (58%) for Thau oyster consumers and 0/22 for non-consumers (p=0.00002).

Environmental investigations revealed heavy rainfall, an overflow of a water purification station and faecal contamination of the Etang de Thau in December. Oysters from the Etang de Thau were responsible for a number of clusters of norovirus GE in winter 2002 in France and also in Italy. High Escherichia Coli levels in Thau water and shellfish led to an official request, mid-December, for oyster purification before distribution.

Preliminary ecological and resistance risks assessment revealed that there were no adverse ecological and resistance risks, however, our study suggests that it is imperative to pay due attention to monitor the antibiotics contamination in rapid growing aquaculture sector of Bangladesh for the reduction of potential risks of antibiotics on aquatic organisms as well as human health."

Getting accurate estimates of Cryptosporidium contamination levels in molluscan shellfish is difficult because recovery efficiencies are dependent on the isolation method used. Such estimates are important for determining the human health risks posed by consumption of contaminated shellfish. In the present study, oocyst recovery was compared for multiple methods used to isolate Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts from oysters (Crassostrea virginica) after exposure to contaminated water for 24 h. The immunomagnetic separation (IMS) and immunofluorescent antibody procedures from Environmental Protection Agency method 1623 were adapted for these purposes. Recovery efficiencies for the different methods were also determined using oyster tissue homogenate and hemolymph spiked with oocysts. There were significant differences in recovery efficiency among the different treatment groups (P < 0.05). We observed the highest recovery efficiency (i. e. , 51%) from spiked samples when hemolymph was kept separate during the homogenization of the whole oyster meat but was then added to the pellet following diethyl ether extraction of the homogenate, prior to IMS. Using this processing method, as few as 10 oocysts could be detected in a spiked homogenate sample by nested PCR. In the absence of water quality indicators that correlate with Cryptosporidium contamination levels, assessment of shellfish safety may rely on accurate quantification of oocyst loads, necessitating the use of processing methods that maximize oocyst recovery. The results from this study have important implications for regulatory agencies charged with determining the safety of molluscan shellfish for human consumption."

Besides effects caused by temperature rise and lowered pH conditions, chemicals of current use can also adversely affect aquatic organisms. Both climate change and emerging pollutants, including toxic impacts in marine invertebrates, have been investigated in recent years. However, less information is available on the combined effects of these physical and chemical stressors that, in nature, occur simultaneously. Thus, this study contrasts the effects caused by the antimicrobial agent and plastic additive, Triclosan (TCS) in the related clams Ruditapes philippinarum (invasive) and Ruditapes decussatus (native) and evaluates if the impacts are influenced by combined temperature and pH modifications. Organisms were acclimated for 30 days at two conditions (control: 17 °C; pH 8.1 and climate change scenario: 21 °C, pH 7.7) in the absence of the drug (experimental period I) followed by a 7 days exposure under the same water physical parameters but either in absence (unexposed) or presence of TCS at 1 μg/L (experimental period II). Biochemical responses covering metabolic, oxidative defences and damage-related biomarkers were contrasted in clams at the end of experimental period II. The overall picture showed a well-marked antioxidant activation and higher TCS bioaccumulation of the drug under the forecasted climate scenario despite a reduction on respiration rate and unaltered metabolism in the exposed clams. Since clams are highly consumed shellfish, the consequences for higher tissue bioaccumulation of anthropogenic chemicals to final consumers should be alerted not only at present conditions but more significantly under predicted climatic conditions for humans but also for other components of the marine trophic chain."

Since 2008, harmful algae and phycotoxins occurrence related to three shellfish poisoning syndromes: Diarrhetic (DSP), Amnesic (ASP), and Paralytic (PSP) shellfish poisonings have been monitored in Santa Catarina State, Brazil. The objectives of this study were: (1) to identify representative sampling areas from which shellfish samples should be collected each round of the monitoring cycle and (2) to define an alternative sampling strategy for phycotoxins detection that requires less samples and/or smaller pool sizes according to different laboratorial methods officially recognized. Using geographic information system, we designed 24 sampling areas. To calculate sample sizes for phycotoxins detection in mollusc soft tissues, we simulated six scenarios with different values of prevalence and test sensitivity. Considering High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode-Array Detection (HPLC-DAD) and mice bioassays, the most realist scenario was the one of ≥20% of prevalence and highly sensitive tests, which resulted in one pool of 20 Perna perna mussels each to detect ASP toxins, two pools of 15 to detect PSP, and two pools of 30 to detect Lipophilic Toxins (DSP + Yessotoxin). With the use of liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, only one pool of 15 mussels would be enough for target phycotoxins detection. The strategy of sampling using the defined areas associated with LC-MS/MS analysis requires less samples and a smaller pool size without losing area representativeness and surveillance system sensitivity."

In this study, we report findings of an initial survey of PBDE, OH-PBDE and MeO-PBDE content in common seafood items available to residents living in the Puget Sound region of Washington State. Seafood samples were either purchased from local grocery stores or caught off the coast of SE Alaska and in Puget Sound. The edible portions of the seafood were analyzed, which for finfish was white muscle (skinless fillets) and for shellfish, either the entire soft tissue (bivalves) or processed meat (calamari, shrimp and scallops). Results indicated that finfish typically had higher levels of PBDEs compared to shellfish with BDE-47 and BDE-99 as the most common congeners detected. Among shellfish, bivalves (clams and mussels) were notable for having much higher levels of OH- and MeO-PBDEs compared to other types of seafood with 6'-OH-BDE-47 and 2'-MeO-BDE-68 being the more common OH- and MeO- congeners, respectively. Based on our results and recent updates to daily fish consumption rates, estimated intake rates for Washington State residents will be between 34 and 644ngPBDEs/day, depending on species consumed. For the OH- and MeO- forms, daily exposure is much more variable but typically would range between 15 and 90ng/day for most seafood types. If shellfish are primarily consumed, OH-PBDE intake could be as high as 350ng/day. These daily intake rates for PBDEs are higher than most dietary intake rates calculated for populations in other world regions."

For this purpose, water samples and fish (Geophagus brasiliensis) (Perciformes: Cichlidae) were collected from September 2013 to May 2014. The fish G. brasiliensis were separated in two groups. The first one ""site group"" was euthanized after the sampling and their weight and length were measured. The blood, brain, muscle and liver were collected for chemical, biochemical and genetics biomarkers analysis. The second group ""depuration group"" was submitted to depuration experiment for 40 days in clean water. After that, the same procedures as for the first group were carried out. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was the dominant cyanobacteria found in the reservoir, and it showed a density above the recommended limit by Brazilian legislation of 20,000 cells/mL. Results showed that the fish accumulate PSTs in the Reservoir and these were not eliminated after 40 days. The biochemical and genotoxic biomarkers showed a significant difference between ""site groups"" and ""depuration groups"", which suggests a recovery of the antioxidant system and a reduction of cellular damage after 40 days in clean water. In conjunction with results reported earlier by others, Alagados Reservoir, in South Brazil, appears to have a persistent contamination of cyanotoxins.

After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, smoking habit, and consumption of other food groups, six PCDDs/PCDFs with 4-6 substituted chlorine atoms and 10 DL-PCBs, but not HeptaCDD/F or OctaCDD, showed significant positive correlations with the frequency of intake of fish and shellfish. Furthermore, significant positive relationships were also found between plasma levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a biomarker of fish intake, and 10 PCDDs/PCDFs with 4-6 chlorine atoms and 10 DL-PCBs. The partial correlation coefficients with plasma DHA were significantly higher for DL-PCBs than for PCDDs/PCDFs, and partial correlation coefficients for PCDDs/PCDFs significantly decreased with increasing number of chlorine atoms (Spearman r = -0.80, P = 0.001). Blood levels of PCDDs/PCDFs with 4-6 chlorine atoms and DL-PCBs were positively associated with fish intake in the Japanese population. These results may be explained by the higher degree of bioaccumulation of these congeners in fish and shellfish in the ecosystem, and the high consumption of fish among the Japanese population."

Aim of our study was to investigate whether shellfish represents a reservoir of C. difficile human PCR-ribotypes (RTs). 702 shellfish samples of farmed and wild bivalve mollusc species were collected over the 2015-2017 period in North Adriatic Italian Sea to investigate contamination with C. difficile and characterize the isolates in terms of genotypic variability and antimicrobial resistance profile. C. difficile was detected in 16.9% (CI: 14.1%-19.8%) samples: 11.6% mussels and 23.2% clams. Compared to mussels, clams were significantly associated with detection of C. difficile (OR = 2.4, P < 0.01). Overall 113 C. difficile isolates were genotyped and 75 (66.4%) were toxigenic. Fifty-three different RTs were identified. 40.7% C. difficile isolates were among the RTs most commonly involved in human infection in Europe. The profile of antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by E-test; microbiological resistance was frequent against clindamycin (17%), erythromycin (23%), rifampicin (8.8%) and moxifloxacin (10.6%). All isolates were susceptible to metronidazole and one showed MIC > ECOFF for vancomycin. C. difficile strains showed high variety in RTs, most of them already detected in other animals or known as highly virulent and epidemic in humans. These results prompt towards investigating on specific risk mitigation measures against C. difficile and are preliminary for any source attribution and risk assessment study."

However, purified ovatoxins are not widely available and their toxicities are still unknown. The aim of this study was to improve understanding of the ecophysiology of Ostreopsis cf. ovata and its toxin production as well as to optimize the purification process for ovatoxin. During Ostreopsis blooms in 2011 and 2012 in Villefranche-sur-Mer (France, NW Mediterranean Sea), microalgae epiphytic cells and marine organisms were collected and analyzed both by LC-MS/MS and hemolysis assay. Results obtained with these two methods were comparable, suggesting ovatoxins have hemolytic properties. An average of 223 μg·kg-1 of palytoxin equivalent of whole flesh was found, thus exceeding the threshold of 30 μg·kg-1 in shellfish recommended by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Ostreopsis cells showed the same toxin profile both in situ and in laboratory culture, with ovatoxin-a (OVTX-a) being the most abundant analogue (~50%), followed by OVTX-b (~15%), p-PLTX (12%), OVTX-d (8%), OVTX-c (5%) and OVTX-e (4%). Ostreopsis cf. ovata produced up to 2 g of biomass per L of culture, with a maximum concentration of 300 pg PLTX equivalent cell-1. Thus, an approximate amount of 10 mg of PLTX-group toxins may be produced with 10 L of this strain. Toxin extracts obtained from collected biomass were purified using different techniques such as liquid-liquid partition or size exclusion. Among these methods, open-column chromatography with Sephadex LH20 phase yielded the best results with a cleanup efficiency of 93% and recovery of about 85%, representing an increase of toxin percentage by 13 fold. Hence, this purification step should be incorporated into future isolation exercises."

To survey the Vibrio contamination in sea snails (Neptunea cumingi Crosse and Busycon canaliculatu), a total of 20 samples were collected from traditional market, at Qingdao city in Shandong province, China and analyzed for Vibrio species contamination. Presumptive-positive colonies grown on a specific Vibrio agar-based medium were picked and identified by the VITEKTM. Vibrio alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulgaris were isolated and identified in 11, 8, and 2 seafood samples, respectively. Among the 8 isolates of V. parahaemolyticus. The V. parahaemolyticus isolates were further tested for the tdh, trh, and tlh virulence factors. All the V. parahaemolyticus isolates were tlh-positive, however, all of them were tdh-negative. Interestingly 2 V. parahaemolyticus isolates were positive for trh virulence factor. These results indicated that there is a high incidence of V. alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus in sea snails. Therefore, food safety regulations for fishery auction markets should be established to control these species in addition to other Vibrio pathogenic contaminants.

Unfortunately, robust, quantitative methods for sampling and analysis of enteric and other viruses in processed or complex foods are not well-established. As a result, epidemiologically determined etiologies or pathogen sources in foodborne outbreaks are rarely confirmed by virological analysis. In this study, an acid-adsorption elution concentration (AEC) method previously used to monitor virus occurrence and investigate enteric virus outbreaks in shellfish was adapted for examination of processed food items, namely tomato sauce and blended strawberries. Hepatitis A virus (HAV), poliovirus, and coliphage MS2 (MS2) were seeded in 10 or 30 g samples of tomato sauce or blended strawberries, recovered by AEC, and quantified by cell culture infectivity assay. In addition, nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and TaqMan RT-PCR assays were used to detect HAV RNA. Viruses were efficiently adsorbed to foods as an initial concentration step, with infectious HAV and MS2 adsorption of 67% and 93%, respectively, to tomato sauce, and 89% and 99%, respectively, to blended strawberries. Forty-three to 65% of HAV and poliovirus were subsequently eluted and recovered from tomato sauce using 0.5 M threonine, pH 7.2. The lower limits of HAV detection were at initial seeding levels of 14 PFU/g of tomato sauce and 33 PFU/g of blended strawberries. Unlike TaqMan RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR was not inhibited by undiluted final RNA extracts of tomato sauce or blended strawberries. The successful adaptation of the AEC method for enteric and other virus recovery, quantitation and detection in processed foods demonstrates its potential for use in the investigation of foodborne outbreaks of viral etiology and for validation of virus disinfection and sanitary processing procedures used by the food industry."

Capillary electrophoresis (CE)-MS/MS is a technique that is well suited for the analysis of polar marine toxins, and has the potential of providing very high resolution separation. Here, we present a CE-MS/MS method developed, with use of a custom-built interface, for the sensitive multiclass analysis of paralytic shellfish toxins, tetrodotoxins, and domoic acid in seafood. A novel, highly acidic background electrolyte (5 M formic acid) was designed to maximize protonation of analytes and to allow a high degree of sample stacking to improve the limits of detection. The method was applied to a wide range of regulated and less common toxin analogues, and exhibited a high degree of selectivity between toxin isomers and matrix interference. The limits of detection in mussel tissue were 0.0052 mg/kg for tetrodotoxins, 0.160 mg/kg for domoic acid, and between 0.0018 and 0.120 mg/kg for paralytic shellfish toxins, all of which showed good linearity. Minimal ionization suppression was observed when the response from neat and mussel-matrix-matched standards was corrected with multiple internal standards. Analysis of shellfish matrix reference materials and spiked samples demonstrated good accuracy and precision. Finally, the method was transferred to a commercial CE-MS/MS system to demonstrate its widespread applicability for use in both R & D and routine regulatory settings. The approach of using a highly acidic background electrolyte is of broad interest, and can be considered generally applicable to simultaneous analysis of other classes of small, polar molecules with differing pKa values.

Samples of fresh fish and shellfish collected from fish landing centers and retail fish markets were analyzed by virus concentration, nucleic acid extraction, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Bacterial indicators of fecal contamination were estimated by the most probable number technique. The relationship between the presence of virus and fecal indicators was determined by statistical analysis. A total of 89 samples comprising of fish, shrimps, oysters, clams, and mussels were screened in this study. EV was detected in 32 (35.95%) samples, and all the virus-positive samples belonged to bivalve molluscan group. None of the finfish and crustacean shellfish samples was positive for the enteric viruses. Clams were found to be the most contaminated with 48.4% of the samples being positive for EV. The prevalence of enteric viruses in seafood samples showed a strong positive correlation with the bacteriological indicators of fecal contamination, suggesting that fecal coliform bacteria are good indicators of EVs in tropical seafood. The presence of EVs in seafood is a public health hazard. Increasing level of coastal water contamination from anthropogenic sources is the primary reason for the contamination of seafood with EVs. Continuous monitoring of coastal waters and seafood for enteric viruses will help to ensure the safety of fish and shellfish for human consumption."

The objective is to determine the effect of pigment removal and freezing during the detoxification process. A total of 150 specimens (≥90 mm length) were collected from this area. The live specimens were transferred to a processing plant, where they were measured and gutted, the foot was divided into two equal parts, and pigment was manually removed from one of these parts. The PSP toxicity of each foot (edible tissue) was determined by mouse bioassay (MBA) and high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection and postcolumn oxidation (HPLC-FLD PCOX). The individual toxicity per loco, as the species is known locally, varied from <30 to 146 μg STX diHCL eq 100 g−1 (CV = 43.83%) and from 5.96 to 216.3 μg STX diHCL eq 100 g−1 (CV = 34.63%), using MBA and HPLC, respectively. A generalized linear model showed a negative relation between individual weight and toxicity. The toxicological profile showed a dominance of STX (>95%), neoSTX and GTX2. The removal of pigment produced a reduction in PSP toxicity of up to 90% and could represent a good detoxification tool moving forward. The freezing process in the muscle with pigment did not produce a clear pattern. There is a significant reduction (p < 0.05) of PSP toxicity via PCOX but not MBA.

The dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium produces the most potent paralytic shellfish toxin, saxitoxin (STX). Data on all STX measurements were obtained from 49 different shellfish monitoring sites along the coast of British Columbia for 2002-2012, and monthly toxicity events were identified. We performed hierarchical cluster analysis to group sites that had events in similar areas with similar timing. Machine learning techniques were used to model the complex relationships between toxicity events and environmental variables in each group. The Strait of Georgia and the west coast of Vancouver Island had unique toxicity regimes. Out of the seven environmental variables used, toxicity in each cluster could be described by multivariable models including monthly sea surface temperature, air temperature, sea surface salinity, freshwater discharge, upwelling, and photosynthetically active radiation. The sea surface salinity and freshwater discharge variables produced the strongest univariate models for both geographic areas. Applying these methods in coastal regions could allow for the prediction of shellfish toxicity events by environmental conditions. This has the potential to optimize biotoxin monitoring, improve public health surveillance, and engage the shellfish industry in helping to reduce the risk of PSP."

Because they are shed in high numbers by infected individuals and can persist for a long time in the environment, they pose a serious threat to human health globally. Enteric viruses end up in the environment mainly through discharge or leakage of raw or inadequately treated sewage into water sources such as springs, rivers, dams, or marine estuaries. Human exposure then follows when contaminated water is used for drinking, cooking, or recreation and, importantly, when filter-feeding bivalve shellfish are consumed. The human health hazard posed by enteric viruses is particularly serious in Africa where rapid urbanisation in a relatively short period of time has led to the expansion of informal settlements with poor sanitation and failing or non-existent wastewater treatment infrastructure, and where rural communities with limited or no access to municipal water are dependent on nearby open water sources for their subsistence. The role of sewage-contaminated water and bivalve shellfish as vehicles for transmission of enteric viruses is well documented but, to our knowledge, has not been comprehensively reviewed in the African context. Here we provide an overview of enteric viruses and then review the growing body of research where these viruses have been detected in association with sewage-contaminated water or food in several African countries. These studies highlight the need for more research into the prevalence, molecular epidemiology and circulation of these viruses in Africa, as well as for development and application of innovative wastewater treatment approaches to reduce environmental pollution and its impact on human health on the continent."

A two-dimensional hydrodynamic model was built to simulate the current and dispersion in the model domain, which includes areas uncovered at low tide. The model also includes decay rates to simulate microorganism behavior and assess the influence of fecal input on shellfish quality. The originality lies in the fact that specific features of the study area were considered. Modeling results indicate limited particle movements and long flushing times at the back of the bay, where shellfish are farmed. Computational results showed that under normal conditions, i. e. 94% of the time, when rainfall was less than 10 mm per day, the sector shows acceptable water quality. These results are in agreement with shellfish concentration measured in the field. Under high flow conditions, high concentrations of fecal indicators and astrovirus were measured in the river and tributaries. The corresponding fluxes were over 50 times higher than under normal weather conditions. The location of the shellfish beds near the coast makes them vulnerable and fecal indicators and viruses were detected in shellfish after short rainfall events.

This monitoring involves quantitative HPLC-UV analysis of shellfish domoic acid concentration, the causative toxin for Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning, and water monitoring for Pseudo-nitzschia spp. , the phytoplankton genus that produces domoic acid. The data obtained since 2008 indicate that whilst the occurrence of domoic acid in shellfish was generally below the maximum permitted limit of 20 mg/kg, there were a number of toxic episodes that breached this limit. The data showed an increase in the frequency of both domoic acid occurrence and toxic events, although there was considerable annual variability in intensity and geographical location of toxic episodes. A particularly notable increase in domoic acid occurrence in England was observed during 2014. Comparison of Scottish toxin data and Pseudo-nitzschia cell densities during this ten-year period revealed a complex relationship between the two measurements. Whilst the majority of events were associated with blooms, absolute cell densities of Pseudo-nitzschia did not correlate with domoic acid concentrations in shellfish tissue. This is believed to be partly due to the presence of a number of different Pseudo-nitzschia species in the water that can exhibit variable toxin production. These data highlight the requirement for tissue monitoring as part of an effective monitoring programme to protect the consumer, as well as the benefit of more detailed taxonomic discrimination of the Pseudo-nitzschia genus to allow greater accuracy in the prediction of shellfish toxicity."

Blooming of these species, especially in shellfish farms can affect the aquaculture production and harm human health. Seasonal dynamics of Alexandrium spp. abundance in relationship to environmental factors was investigated from November 2007 to February 2009 at six stations in the Bizerte lagoon, an important shellfish farming area situated in SW Mediterranean. The sampling stations represented different hydrological and trophic conditions: one station TJ (Tinja) is affected by the river plume; two stations (Chaara [Ch] and Canal [Ca]) are influenced by marine inflow (particularly in summer), industrial and urban effluents; and the three other stations (Menzel Abdelrahmen [MA], Menzel Jemil [MJ] and Douaouda [Do]) are located close to shellfish farms. Cell abundance of Alexandrium spp. varied among stations and months. Species of this genus showed a sporadic appearance, but they reached high concentration (0.67-7 × 10(5)cells L(-1)). Maximal cell density was detected in autumn (November 2007; station MA), at salinity of 37.5, temperature of 16 °C and NH(4)(+) level of 55.45 μM. During this month, Alexandrium spp. abundance accounted for a large fraction (61%) of the harmful phytoplankton. The statistical analysis revealed that Alexandrium concentrations were positively correlated with N:P ratio and NH4+ levels. Thus, the eutrophic waters of the lagoon favour the growth of Alexandrium, which seemed to have preference for N-nutrient loading from antrophogenic activities, as ammonium. Blooms of these potential harmful algae may constitute a potential threat in this coastal lagoon of the southern Mediterranean. Consequently, it is necessary to be well vigilant and to do regular monitoring of Alexandrium species."

One of the most widespread toxigenic microalgal taxa is the dinoflagellate Genus Alexandrium, that includes species producing neurotoxins referred to as PST (Paralytic Shellfish Toxins). Blooms cause shellfish harvest restrictions to protect human consumers from accumulated toxins. Large inter-individual variability in toxin load within an exposed bivalve population complicates monitoring of shellfish toxicity for ecology and human health regulation. To decipher the physiological pathways involved in the bivalve response to PST, we explored the whole transcriptome of the digestive gland of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas fed experimentally with a toxic Alexandrium minutum culture. The largest differences in transcript abundance were between oysters with contrasting toxin loads (1098 transcripts), rather than between exposed and non-exposed oysters (16 transcripts), emphasizing the importance of toxin load in oyster response to toxic dinoflagellates. Additionally, penalized regressions, innovative in this field, modeled accurately toxin load based upon only 70 transcripts. Transcriptomic differences between oysters with contrasting PST burdens revealed a limited suite of metabolic pathways affected, including ion channels, neuromuscular communication, and digestion, all of which are interconnected and linked to sodium and calcium exchanges. Carbohydrate metabolism, unconsidered previously in studies of harmful algal effects on shellfish, was also highlighted, suggesting energy challenge in oysters with high toxin loads. Associations between toxin load, genotype, and mRNA levels were revealed that open new doors for genetic studies identifying genetically-based low toxin accumulation."

This resulted in the first commercial closure in Australia for this species. Questions were raised on how the toxins were transferred to the lobsters, how long the toxins would persist, whether PST-contaminated hepatopancreas posed a risk to human health, and what management strategies could be applied. The aim of this study was to investigate whether PST-contaminated mussels are a potential vector enabling toxin accumulation in J. edwardsii and to collect information on toxin uptake, distribution and depuration rates and toxin profiles under controlled experimental settings. Lobsters were fed mussels naturally contaminated with PST for a period of 28 days in an experimental setting; following this, lobsters were allocated to either fed or starved treatment groups. PST were not detected in the tail tissue of lobsters at any stage of the experiment. Lobster hepatopancreas contained mean levels of 2.4 mg STX.2HCl eq/kg after 28 days of uptake, although substantial variability in total toxicity was observed. The PST profile of the hepatopancreas was similar to that of the contaminated mussels used as feed. Significant differences were noted in the PST depuration rates between fed and starved treatment groups. The daily depuration rate for total PST was estimated to be 0.019 and 0.013 mg STX.2HCl eq/kg for the fed and starved treatment groups respectively using a constant-rate decay model. After 42 days of depuration, total PST (STX equivalents) levels in the hepatopancreas of all lobsters were below 0.8 mg STX.2HCl eq/kg, which represents the regulatory level applied to bivalves. This result indicates that long-term holding to depurate PST may potentially be used as a risk management tool."

Here, we optimized a fast and sensitive analytical method for the determination of STX, neosaxitoxin (NeoSTX), and their decarbamoyl analogues in surface waters. The method involves a simple filtration, addition of isotope-labelled internal standard (ILIS), and analysis by on-line solid-phase extraction coupled to hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (on-line SPE-HILIC-HRMS). Except glass fiber filters, other tested materials (e. g. , nylon, nitrocellulose) provided suitable filtration performance. Time-dependent adsorptive losses occurred during the LC-MS batch sequence if glass autosampler vials were used, while no such effect was observed for polypropylene autosampler vials. Matrix effects were evaluated for 4 different quantification scenarios, including external vs. internal curves and neat reagent water vs. matrix-matched curves. Matrix-matched calibration with ILIS correction (NeoSTX-15N7) provided the best performance overall. The analytical method was validated in freshwater lake water and estuarine brackish water (30‰ salinity), with suitable determination coefficients (R2 > 0.9975), matrix spike accuracy (90-107%), and intraday/interday precision (RSD of 0.61-16%). Method limits of detection (LOD in lake water: 0.72-3.9 ng/L) are also improved over most of the recent literature.

The Gulf of Maine is a complex marine ecosystem comprising twelve physioregions, including the Bay of Fundy, coastal shelf areas and deeper basins that contain highly productive fishing grounds. Here we review available data on spatial and temporal Hg trends to better understand the drivers of human and biological exposures. Atmospheric Hg deposition from U. S. and Canadian sources has declined since the mid-1990s in concert with emissions reductions and deposition from global sources has increased. Oceanographic circulation is the dominant source of total Hg inputs to the entire Gulf of Maine region (59%), followed by atmospheric deposition (28%), wastewater/industrial sources (8%) and rivers (5%). Resuspension of sediments increases MeHg inputs to overlying waters, raising concerns about benthic trawling activities in shelf regions. In the near coastal areas, elevated sediment and mussel Hg levels are co-located in urban embayments and near large historical point sources. Temporal patterns in sentinel species (mussels and birds) have in some cases declined in response to localized point source mercury reductions but overall Hg trends do not show consistent declines. For example, levels of Hg have either declined or remained stable in eggs from four seabird species collected in the Bay of Fundy since 1972. Quantitatively linking Hg exposures from fish harvested from the Gulf of Maine to human health risks is challenging at this time because no data are available on the geographic origin of seafood consumed by coastal residents. In addition, there is virtually no information on Hg levels in commercial species for offshore regions of the Gulf of Maine where some of the most productive fisheries are located. Both of these data gaps should be priorities for future research."

The method consists of a single-step dispersive extraction in 1% acetic acid, followed by a carbon SPE cleanup step before dilution and instrumental analysis.

The method can also be run as the acquisition of TTX together with paralytic shellfish toxins. Results demonstrated acceptable method performance characteristics for specificity, linearity, recovery, ruggedness, repeatability, matrix variability, and within-laboratory reproducibility for the analysis of TTX. The LOD and LOQ were fit-for-purpose in comparison to the current action limit for TTX enforced in The Netherlands. In addition, aspects of method performance (LOD, LOQ, and within-laboratory reproducibility) were found to be satisfactory for three other TTX analogs (11-nor TTX-6-ol, 5-deoxy TTX, and 4,9-anhydro TTX).

The sites were selected as part of the monitoring network for the assessment of algal toxins bioaccumulation by the competent Authority. Samples positive to paralytic shellfish toxins and to lipophilic toxins were detected through the mouse bioassay. Lipophilic toxins were assessed by HPLC. Decreasing yessotoxins (YTX) levels were observed in mussels from June to December, while homo-YTX contents increased concomitantly. Lysosome membrane stability (LMS), glutathione S-transferase and catalase activities, and multixenobiotic resistance (MXR)-related gene expressions were assessed as parameters related to the mussel health status and widely utilized in environmental biomonitoring. Levels of cAMP were also measured, as possibly involved in the algal toxin mechanisms of action. Low LMS values were observed in hemocytes from mussels positive to the mouse bioassay. MXR-related gene expressions were greatly inhibited in mussels positive to the mouse bioassay. Clear correlations were established between increasing homo-YTX contents (and decreasing YTX) and increasing cAMP levels in the tissues. Similarly, significant correlations were established between the increase of homo-YTX and cAMP levels, and the expressions of three MXR-related genes at submaximal toxin concentrations. In conclusion, YTXs may affect mussel physiological parameters, including hemocyte functionality, gene expression and cell signaling."

From a human health perspective, it is important to evaluate the presence of NP-Hg in seafoods. We investigated the in vivo formation of NP-Hg in fish and shellfish, which are the main sources of Hg exposure in humans. NP-Hg was measured in 90 fish samples with single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (spICP-MS) after enzyme degradation with pancreatin and lipase. In addition to NP-Hg, total Hg (T-Hg), MeHg, and selenium (Se) concentrations were evaluated. Transient Hg signals were detected as nanoparticles from almost all samples by using spICP-MS. Higher particle number concentrations (CPN) were observed in the tuna-swordfish group than in the shellfish group (17.7 × 107 vs. 1.2 × 106 particles/g, respectively). Although the CPN and maximum particle mass increased significantly with increasing T-Hg concentration, the increase in CPN was greater than those in maximum particle mass. Assuming that the NP-Hg detected was HgSe (tiemannite) and spherical based on previous reports, the maximum particle diameter was estimated to be 89 nm. The mean dietary exposures to NP-Hg, T-Hg, and MeHg were estimated to be 0.067, 5.75, and 5.32 μg/person per day, respectively. Generation of NP-Hg was inferred to be widespread in marine animals, with a preferential increase in the number of particles rather than an increase in particle size. The mean dietary exposure to NP-Hg in Japanese people was estimated to be 1.2 ng/kg body weight (BW) per day. Compared to PTWI of 4 μg/kg BW per week (0.57 μg/kg BW per day) derived by JECFA (2011), the health risk from redissolved I-Hg from NP-Hg is small."

In the Argentine Sea, this has been identified as an issue for the offshore fisheries of Patagonian scallops (Zygochlamys patagonica), leading to potentially harmful effects on consumers. Here we assess spatial and temporal patterns in marine biotoxin concentrations in Patagonian scallops harvested in Argentinian waters between 2012-2017, based on analyses for paralytic shellfish toxins, lipophilic toxins, and amnesic shellfish toxins. There was no evidence for concentrations of lipophilic or amnesic toxins above regulatory acceptance thresholds, with trace concentrations of pectenotoxin 2, azaspiracid 2 and okadaic acid group toxins confirmed. Conversely, paralytic shellfish toxins were quantified in some scallops. Gonyautoxins 1 and 2 dominated the unusual toxin profiles (91%) in terms of saxitoxin equivalents with maximum concentrations reaching 3985 µg STX eq/kg and with changes in profiles linked in part to seasonal changes. Total toxin concentrations were compared between samples of the adductor muscle and whole tissue, with results showing the absence of toxins in the adductor muscle confirming toxin accumulation in the digestive tracts of the scallops and the absence of a human health threat following the processing of scallop adductor meat. These findings highlight that paralytic shellfish toxins with an unusual toxin profile can occur in relatively high concentrations in whole Patagonian scallops in specific regions and during particular time periods, also showing that the processing of scallops on board factory ships to obtain frozen adductor muscle is an effective management process that minimizes the risk of poisonings from final products destined for human consumption."

Among secondary consumers, it has been described that carnivorous gastropods can accumulate these toxins when they prey on bivalves that have been exposed to toxic microalgae; these could also harm human health. In Chile, frequent events of harmful algal blooms caused by the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella have been described. This organism produces paralytic shellfish toxin (PST) which has been identified in some carnivorous gastropods. The objective of this research was to identify the physiological and reproductive response of the carnivorous gastropod Acanthina monodon fed on the Mytilid Perumytilus purpuratus, which had previously been maintained on a diet containing PST. Specimens of A. monodon showed a decrease in ingestion and absorption rate when they consumed PST indirectly through their diet. The oxygen consumption rate was also affected by the diet-time interaction. The variations of these parameters were reflected in the scope for growth, since the available energy was lower in gastropods exposed to toxic diet. Consumption of PST had a negative effect on the reproduction of A. monodon, since intoxicated adults presented lower egg-masses and delayed start of oviposition. We observed a delay in the development of the embryos inside the capsules, and a lower number of hatched juveniles, although these few juveniles from intoxicated parents accomplished higher growth rates during the next 6 months. We may therefore suggest that toxin transfer, from harmful microalgae through the trophic chain, can generate deleterious effects on the physiological energetics of the organisms that consume them, affecting their reproductive capacity and early ontogenetic development."

Finfish have a more effective mixed-function oxidase enzyme system than shellfish, and are therefore able to metabolise and excrete PAH more effectively than the invertebrates. Thus, contamination by high-molecular weight PAH, including those with carcinogenic potential and so of concern with regard to human consumers, is therefore usually observed in shellfish, and particularly in bivalve molluscs. Oil spills are not the sole source of PAH, however, as parent compounds are also generated by a wide range of combustion processes. In this paper, consideration is given to monitoring data gathered following recent oil spills (both of crude oil and diesel fuel), alongside data from other studies. These include studies conducted around a former gasworks site and downstream of an aluminium smelter in the UK, and from mussel monitoring studies undertaken in the UK and the USA (including the Exxon Valdez oil spill and the National Status and Trends programme), and in other countries in Europe. For comparative purposes the PAH concentrations are summed and also expressed as benzo[a]pyrene equivalents, their relative concentrations being weighted in relation to the carcinogenic potential of individual PAH compounds using toxic equivalency factors (TEF). Our aim was to assess the utility of this approach in fishery resource monitoring and control following oil spills. Certainly this approach seems useful from the data assessed in this study. and the relative ranking of the various studies seems to reflect the relative degree of concern for human consumers due to the differing contamination sources. As a simple tool for control purposes it is equally applicable to PAH derived from oil spills, and from industrial and combustion sources."

Individual shellfish consumption data and body weight were collected and analyzed with a 24-hour dietary recall method on three non-consecutive days. The consumers were divided into two groups: aged 2-12 years group and aged ≥13 years. Exposure levels were estimated based using a semi-probabilistic risk assessment method and cumulative exposures among individual persons using the maximum cumulative ratio (MCR) method. The mean, median and 95th percentile of all metals exposure for age 2-12 years group were higher than age ≥13 years group, but none exceeded the respective reference doses of the metals. The mean hazard indices (HI) of each metal in shellfish for both age groups were less than 1.

Part of this program was devoted to fit-for-purpose cell-based assays (CBA) as complementary tools to collect toxicity data on atypical positive-mouse bioassay shellfish extracts. A collaborative study involving five laboratories was conducted. The responses of human hepatic (HepG2), human intestinal (Caco2), and mouse neuronal (Neuro2a) cell lines exposed to three known lipophilic phycotoxins-okadaic acid (OA), azaspiracid-1 (AZA1), and pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2)-were investigated. A screening strategy composed of standard operating procedures and a decision tree for dose-response modeling and assay validation were designed after a round of ""trial-and-error"" process. For each toxin, the shape of the concentration-response curves and the IC(50) values were determined on the three cell lines. Whereas OA induced a similar response irrespective of the cell line (complete sigmoid), PTX2 was shown to be less toxic. AZA1 induced cytotoxicity only on HepG2 and Neuro2a, but not on Caco2. Intra- and inter-laboratory coefficients of variation of cell responses were large, with mean values ranging from 35 to 54 % and from 37 to 48 %, respectively. Investigating the responses of the selected cell lines to well-known toxins is the first step supporting the use of CBA among the panel of methods for characterizing atypical shellfish toxicity. Considering these successful results, the CBA strategy will be further applied to extracts of negative, spiked, and naturally contaminated shellfish tissues."

The seafood samples were chosen based on their popularity as a food source and the potential of the species to contain high levels of metals based on past research results. Metal concentrations in the biota showed marked interspecific differences with C. sapidus recording the highest concentrations of all the metals. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) showed that C. sapidus and T. zilli have the greatest potential to concentrate Cd (BCF = 3-10) and Pb (BCF = 11-84) respectively. Lead uptake from both water and sediment (BCF ≈ BSAF: 0.003-0.018) were abysmally low in L. littorea as compared with other organisms. The high concentrations of Pb in fish species, effective bioaccumulation of Cd in species of crab and periwinkles, as well as very high BSAF of Ni found in species of crab indicated a strong influence from anthropogenic pollutant source on the biotic community. Oil pollution appears to be a major source of bioavailable metal contaminants for the selected biota. The study shows that C. sapidus and L. littorea can effectively compartmentalize potentially toxic metals such as Cd, Pb and Ni within their tissues. In terms of toxicity, C. sapidus had Cd concentrations greater than the 3,000 ng/g limit set by the Commission of the European Communities while Pb concentration exceeded their limits in both C. sapidus and T. zilli. All levels of Ni were below the U. S. Food and Drug Administration action levels for these metals in fish, crustaceans and shellfish.

Subsequent remobilization of mercury buried in the sediment may be harmful to various marine organisms. In order to assess the availability of remobilised mercury to marine organisms and to assess the health risk of consumption of shellfish species from the bay, a monitoring programme was initiated in September 1997. One thousand six hundred specimens of mussels (Mytilus galloprotincialis) of the same size and age, collected in a very clean area, were transferred to four stations in the bay 1.5 m above the sea bottom. Every month during the summer period and every second month in the winter period, 50 mussels were taken from each station for the analysis of mercury and monomethylmercury (MeHg) content. The results obtained during 1 year of biomonitoring suggest that the equilibrium concentration in transplanted mussels was established in a relative short period of time. The digestive gland is preferential organ for the accumulation of total mercury. Seasonal variation of mercury content both in the whole soft tissue, and organs (gills and digestive gland) was observed at all stations. However, methyl mercury is more concentrated in soft tissues than in digestive gland and gills, despite the fact that it is absorbed through these organs. The mercury levels in tissues were below accepted limits for human consumption. Obtained results showed that the implantation of mussels in an area containing sediment contaminated by mercury may be a good monitoring tool for the assessment of the availability of remobilised mercury to marine organisms."

These sources typically include sewage outfalls, seepage from septic tanks, and urban and agricultural runoff. Shellfish as filter feeders are particularly susceptible to contamination in faecally contaminated waters and a range of microbiological indicators have been developed to assess the levels of contamination and likely risks to public health (Hackney and Pierson, 1994). This paper outlines the application of bacterial source tracking (BST) in a shellfish growing area in part of the Port Stephens estuary along the NSW north coast. The approach is based on the premise that bacterial isolates from different faecal sources will have significantly different resistance patterns to the battery of antibiotics and concentrations tested. Faecal streptococci (FS) were isolated from several possible faecal sources: beef and dairy cattle, chickens and humans. The resistance patterns of these isolates to four different concentrations of four antibiotics were compared to those of FS isolates obtained from samples collected upstream and in the vicinity of the oyster leases. Discriminant analysis was performed using the patterns from the known source isolates and the rate of correct classification was determined for each source. The predictive function of discriminant analysis was then used to determine the most probable source of each of the unknown isolates from Tilligerry Creek, the drainage channels to the estuary, and the shellfish leases. Preliminary results are presented here and suggest that there is no single significant source of faecal contamination, rather there are contributions from a range of sources. The findings may have implications for the ways in which land use activities and catchments are managed in similar estuarine locations with a shellfish industry."

Undesirable effects and also sanitary problems in both types of eutrophication are often produced, but they may differ greatly in frequency and significance. Some algal biotoxins can affect both marine animals and man, whilst others affect man alone. From data currently available it appears that the sanitary state of man can be affected through the digestive, respiratory and cutaneous apparatus. Four main dinoflagellate biointoxications are now recognized: paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP), diarrhoetic shellfish poisoning (DSP), and venerupin poisoning. Other biointoxications are due to a diatom bloom responsible for amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) and to blue algae blooms which have effects on the skin and the respiratory tract. All these marine toxins are considered and particular attention is paid to: producing organisms, chemistry of the components, compromised sea foods, methods of analysis, occurrence worldwide, human intoxications, toxicology and mechanism of action on a molecular level, therapeutical notes, tolerance levels and remarks on safety. Attention is also paid to the relationship between the anthropogenic eutrophication and PSP and DSP since these are the most widespread biointoxications from toxic marine dinoflagellates in the world today and for which the European Economic Community (EEC) is proposing health legislation such as tolerance limits and methods for official analysis. In view of the harmful potential of coastal anthropogenic eutrophication, the main current committment of various countries concerns control. Finally, it is important to develop a suitable monitor research system using all the specific standards of allowed toxic substances, and also research on effective antiodotes against all biotoxins."

Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the concentrations of PFCs in seafood. In this study, we measured thirteen PFCs in 47 fatty fish and 45 shellfish samples collected from six coastal provinces in China (Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong), using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) was the dominant PFC in fatty fish which accounted for 38% of total PFCs, whereas perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA) was the predominant PFC in shellfish. Concentrations of PFOS were ranged from less than 1.4 to 1627 pg/g wet weight in fatty fish, with the highest concentration in red drum from Jiangsu. Concentrations of PFOA in shellfish ranged from less than 5.4 to 7543 pg/g wet weight, with the maximum concentration found in briny clam also from Jiangsu. Compared with other studies, the PFC levels in seafood collected from our studied areas are relatively low. The estimated dietary intakes (EDI, pg/kg body weight /day) of PFOA, PFOS and total PFCs for the reference man (63 kg body weight) were calculated by multiplying the mean concentrations (pg/g wet weight) of PFOA, PFOS and total PFCs in six coastal provinces with the daily consumption data (g/day) from the fourth Chinese total diet study carried out in 2007. The highest EDI of PFOS and PFOA were found to be 694 pg/kg body weight/day and 914 pg/kg body weight/day in Guangdong and Jiangsu, respectively. However, the highest EDI of total PFCs was found in Fujian at 2513 pg/kg body weight/day. The EDI from seafood is much lower than the tolerable daily intake (TDI) recommended by the European Food Safety Authority in 2008 indicating low health risk of PFC exposure via eating seafood among the coastal populations in China."

The Hangzhou Bay and Qiantang Estuary region are facing unusual perturbation due to rapid development along the embayment in recent decades. This study evaluated the organic and inorganic pollutants in water, sediment, and from the muscles of higher trophic organisms (fish, crustacean, shellfish) during four different seasons (in 2018-2019) along the Qiantang Estuary and Hangzhou Bay region to assess the ecosystem health and potential hazard status. Dissolved inorganic phosphate and nitrogen were the major pollutants in this area, which led to severe eutrophication throughout the study period. Eutrophication signals coincided well with the phytoplankton abundance, which revels the control of nutrient enrichment on the spatio-temporal distribution of phytoplankton. Food availability, along with salinity and temperature, drives the zooplankton population distribution. Heavy metals were not the issue of water quality as their concentrations meet the national and international baseline standards. However, in the sediments, Copper (Cu) and Arsenic (As) concentrations were higher than the baseline value. Towards the northwestern part of the Qiantang Estuary, the overall potential risk index of sediment with higher Cadmium (Cd) and Mercury (Hg) depicted delicate condition with moderate risk for the sediment contamination. The As concentration in fishes was close to the baseline standards limit irrespective of low As values within water and sediments. The higher concentrations of Zinc (Zn) and As in shellfish muscles, whereas other metals were within the limit of baseline standard in all the organisms. However, the hazard analysis (Targeted hazard quotient, THQ) values for the seafood consumption to human health indicates the potentially threatening consequences of shellfish and crustacean consumption on human health."

In this study, through a multidisciplinary approach, the presence of several bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. , and Vibrio spp. ) and viral pathogens (hepatitis A virus and norovirus genogroups I and II) was evaluated from March 2017 to February 2018. In addition, phytoplankton composition in lagoon waters and associated algal biotoxins (paralytic and diarrhetic shellfish poisoning) in mussels were also monitored. The aim of this study was to provide useful data to improve knowledge about their seasonal presence and to assess the potential risk for public health, as well as to provide input for future conservation and management strategies. In mussels, Salmonella spp. were found in spring, along with E. coli, but Salmonella spp. were not found in autumn or winter, even though E. coli was detected in these seasons. Vibrio parahaemolyticus was found in autumn and winter, but not in spring. Norovirus genogroups I and II were found in winter samples. None of the bacteria were found in summer. Algal biotoxins have never been detected in mussel samples. Among potentially harmful phytoplankton, only Pseudo-nitzschia spp. were present, mainly in summer. The results showed that a possible bacterial and viral contamination, together with the presence of potentially toxic microalgae, is a real problem. Therefore, the development of natural resource management strategies is necessary to ensure the good quality of waters and guarantee the protection of consumers."

Little is known regarding genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of Domoic Acid (DA), the major Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP) toxin. Both OA and DA occur in seafood and are of human health concerns. Micronuclei (MN) arise from abnormalities in nuclear division during mitosis due to a failure of the mitotic spindle or by complex chromosomal configurations that pose problems during anaphase. In order to evaluate the ability of okadaic acid (OA) and domoic acid (DA) to induce DNA damage we performed the micronucleus assay using the Caco-2 cell line. To discriminate between a clastogenic or aneugenic effect of OA and DA, the micronucleus assay was conducted by cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay using cytochalasin B with Giemsa staining and/or acridine orange staining, in parallel to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a concentrated human pan-centromeric chromosome paint probe. Our results showed that OA and DA significantly increased the frequency of MN in Caco-2 cells. The MN caused by OA are found in mononucleated cells and binucleated cells, whereas those caused by DA are mainly in binucleated cells. The results of FISH analysis showed that OA induced centromere-positive micronuclei and DA increased the percentage of MN without a centromeric signal. In conclusion, both OA and DA bear mutagenic potential as revealed in Caco-2 cells by induction of MN formation. Moreover, OA induced whole chromosome loss suggesting a specific aneugenic potential, whereas DA seems simply clastogenic. At present, one cannot rule out possible DNA damage of intestinal cells if concentrations studied are reached in vivo, since this may happen with concentrations of toxins just below regulatory limits in case of frequent consumption of contaminated shell fishes."

We developed a database of Hg concentrations in fish and shellfish common to the U. S. market by aggregating available data from government monitoring programs and the scientific literature. We calculated a grand mean for individual seafood items, based on reported means from individual studies, weighted by sample size. We also compared database results to those of federal programs and human health criteria [U. S. Food and Drug Administration Hg Monitoring Program (FDA-MP), U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]. Mean Hg concentrations for each seafood item were highly variable among studies, spanning 0.3-2.4 orders of magnitude. Farmed fish generally had lower grand mean Hg concentrations than their wild counterparts, with wild seafood having 2- to 12-fold higher concentrations, depending on the seafood item. However, farmed fish are relatively understudied, as are specific seafood items and seafood imports from Asia and South America. Finally, we found large discrepancies between mean Hg concentrations estimated from our database and FDA-MP estimates for most seafood items examined. The high variability in Hg in common seafood items has considerable ramifications for public health and the formulation of consumption guidelines.

The two instruments were developed and tested in Spanish and English, reflecting the local ethnic composition in the Newark Bay Complex. The instruments were tested on women of child-bearing age at the Women, Infants, and Children Center in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Detailed diagrams were used in both presentations, including contaminated fish species, fish preparation methods, and food chain bioaccumulation and transmission to the fetus.

Where there were significant differences in understanding about the risks from consuming fish or crabs from the contaminated waters of Newark Bay, in all cases the women exposed to the classroom lesson had a better understanding than those who read the brochure. Ninety-six percent of the women who heard the lesson understood that it was unsafe to eat fish from the port, compared to 72% of those reading the brochure. Both formats succeeded in imparting information to most women about the area under advisories, the fish species under advisories, and transmission of toxins to the fetus. Information on fish preparation was recalled less clearly, partly because women were asked to relate methods to reduce the risk from consuming fish from 11 presented, and most recalled only two or three of the list.

In this study, scallops (Patinopecten yessoensis) and mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were fed in the laboratory with Alexandrium tamarense (ATHK), a PST-producing dinoflagellate. Dynamic variations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px, EC 1.11.1.9) were monitored in the muscle and digestive gland of experimental shellfish. Results showed that ROS was quickly generated and then disappeared in the tissues of scallop and mussel in the PST-accumulating and depurating periods, and that different response of antioxidant enzymes to ROS occurred in the two different bivalves. SOD activity was obviously inhibited in the tissues of scallop, while the CAT activity was not stimulated by the toxic bait in scallop. However, both SOD and CAT activities were induced in the tissues of mussel to effectively scavenge superoxide anion free radical and H2O2. Similar dynamic fluctuation of GSH-Px activity was also stimulated to remove H2O2 or other superoxide compounds in the tissues of both bivalves, which was hypothetically modulated by the depletion and regeneration of glutathione. Only GSH-Px enzyme was induced to remove ROS in scallop, but all SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px enzymes were stimulated to avoid oxidative stress in mussel. The species specific response of antioxidant enzymes between scallop and mussel fed with toxic A. tamarense has been described here for the first time."

Galicia, which is a commercially important EU producer of edible bivalve mollusk have been subjected to recurring cases of mussel farm closures, in the last decades. This work aimed to study the toxic profile of commercial mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) in order to establish a potential risk when ingested. For this, a total of 41 samples of mussels farmed in 3 Rías (Ares-Sada, Arousa, and Pontevedra) and purchased in 5 local markets were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Chromatograms showed the presence of okadaic acid (OA), dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX-2), pectenotoxin-2 (PTX-2), azaspiracid-2 (AZA-2), and the emerging toxins 13-desmethyl spirolide C (SPX-13), and pinnatoxin-G (PnTX-G). Quantification of each toxin was determined using their own standard calibration in the range 0.1%-50 ng/mL (R2 > 0.99) and by considering the toxin recovery (62-110%) and the matrix correction (33-211%). Data showed that OA and DTX-2 (especially in the form of esters) are the main risk in Galician mollusks, which was detected in 38 samples (93%) and 3 of them exceeded the legal limit (160 µg/kg), followed by SPX-13 that was detected in 19 samples (46%) in quantities of up to 28.9 µg/kg. Analysis from PTX-2, AZA-2, and PnTX-G showed smaller amounts. Fifteen samples (37%) were positive for PTX-2 (0.7-2.9 µg/kg), 12 samples (29%) for AZA-2 (0.1-1.8 µg/kg), and PnTX-G was detected in 5 mussel samples (12%) (0.4 µg/kg-0.9 µg/kg). This is the first time Galician mollusk was contaminated with PnTX-G. Despite results indicating that this toxin was not a potential risk through the mussel ingestion, it should be considered in the shellfish safety monitoring programs through the LC-MS/MS methods."

In this work, capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) with capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detector (C(4)D) and UV detection were examined with counter-flow transient isotachophoresis (tITP) to improve the sensitivity and deal with the high conductivity sample matrix. The high sodium concentration in the sample was used as the leading ion while l-alanine was used as the terminating electrolyte (TE) and background electrolyte (BGE) in which the toxins were separated. Careful optimization of the injected sample volume and duration of the counter-flow resulted in limit of detections (LODs) ranging from 74.2 to 1020 ng/mL for tITP-CZE-C(4)D and 141 to 461 ng/mL for tITP-CZE-UV, an 8-97 fold reduction compared to conventional CZE. The LODs were adequate for the analysis of PSTs in shellfish samples close to the regulatory limit. Intra-day and inter-day repeatability values (percentage relative standard deviation, n=3) of tITP-CZE-C(4)D and tITP-CZE-UV methods for both migration time and peak height were in the range of 0.82-11% and 0.76-10%, respectively.

Physiological impact of PST accumulation was comprehensively assessed by a range of behavioural (vitality score, righting ability and reflex impairment score), health (haemocyte count, bacteriology, gill necrosis and parasite load), nutritional (hepatopancreas index and haemolymph refractive index) and haemolymph biochemical (21 parameters including electrolytes, metabolites, and enzymes) parameters during a 63 day period of uptake and depuration of toxins. Exposure to PST did not result in mortality nor significant changes in the behavioural, health, or nutritional measures suggesting limited gross impact on lobster performance. Furthermore, most haemolymph biochemical parameters measured exhibited no significant difference between control and exposed animals. However, the concentration of potassium in the haemolymph increased with PST, whilst the concentration of lactate and the sodium:potassium ratio decreased with PST. In addition, exposed lobsters showed a hyperglycaemic response to PST exposure, indicative of stress. These findings suggest that PST accumulation results in some measurable indicators of stress for lobsters. However, these changes are likely within the adaptive range for Jasus edwardsii and do not result in a significant impairment of gross performance. Our findings support previous conclusions that crustaceans are relatively tolerant to PST and the implications for the lobster fishery are discussed."

The aim of the survey was to determine the presence of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), amnesic shellfish toxins (ASTs), and diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DSTs) in wild-caught abalone at levels above the current Codex marine biotoxin limits during the 2013 fishing season. Abalone (n = 190) were collected from 68 abalone-fishing blocks for which the combined annual harvest accounts for 80 % of Australian production. Concurrent seawater samples were collected and enumerated for potentially toxic phytoplankton. The foot and viscera tissues of each abalone sample were analyzed separately for PSTs, ASTs, and DSTs. No samples (abalone foot or viscera) contained toxins at levels exceeding the marine biotoxin limits stipulated by Codex. The resulting prevalence estimate suggests that less than 1.6 % of the commercially caught wild abalone population in Australia were contaminated with marine biotoxins at levels above the regulatory limit during the survey period. ASTs were detected at very low (trace) levels in the foot and viscera tissue of four and three abalone samples, respectively. To our knowledge, this represents the first reported detection of domoic acid in Australian abalone. PSTs also were detected at very low levels in 17 samples of abalone foot tissue and 6 samples of abalone viscera. The association between the low levels of ASTs and PSTs detected in abalone and the presence of potential toxin-producing phytoplankton in seawater samples was weak. DSTs were not detected in any abalone despite the detection of very low levels of DST-producing phytoplankton in a small number (9 of 77) of seawater samples. The results of this survey should be useful for public health risk assessments and provide additional evidence that the prevalence of marine biotoxins in Australian wild-caught abalone is very low."

Although most prevalent along the south-west Florida coast, periodic blooms have occurred throughout the entire US and Mexico Gulf coasts and the Atlantic coast to North Carolina. This dinoflagellate produces a suite of polyether neurotoxins, called brevetoxins, that cause severe impacts to natural resources, as well as public health. These naturally produced biotoxins may represent one of the most common chemical stressors impacting South Florida coastal and marine ecosystems. Impacts include massive fish kills, marine mammal, sea turtle and sea bird mortalities, benthic community die-off and public health effects from shellfish contamination and inhalation of air-borne toxins. The primary mode of action is binding to voltage-gated sodium channels causing depolarization of nerve cells, thus interfering with nerve transmission. Other effects include immune depression, bronchial constriction and haemolysis. Parent algal toxins are synthesized within the unicellular organism, others are produced as metabolic products. Recent studies into the composition of brevetoxins in cells, water, air and organisms have shown PbTx-2 to be the primary intracellular brevetoxin that is converted over time to PbTx-3 when the cells are ruptured, releasing extracellular brevetoxins into the environment. Brevetoxins become aerosolized by bubble-mediated transport of extracellular toxins, the composition of which varies depending on the composition in the source water. Bivalved molluscs rapidly accumulate brevetoxins as they filter feed on K. brevis cells. However, the parent algal toxins are rapidly metabolized to other compounds, some of which are responsible for neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP). These results provide new insight into the distribution, persistence and impacts of red tide toxins to south-west Florida ecosystems."

The swimming activity was investigated by observation combined with video at 6 timepoints from 1 to 24 h post-exposure. Both aphantoxin doses were associated with delayed touch responses, reduced head-tail locomotory abilities, inflexible turning of head, and a tailward-shifted center of gravity. The normal S-pattern (or undulating) locomotor trajectory was replaced by a mechanical motor pattern of swinging the head after wagging the tail. Finally, these fish principally distributed at the top and/or bottom water of the aquarium, and showed a clear polarized distribution pattern at 12 h post-exposure. Further analysis of neurological function demonstrated that both aphantoxin doses inhibited brain acetylcholinesterase activity. All these changes were dose- and time-dependent. These results demonstrate that aphantoxins can alter locomotor capacity, touch responses and distribution patterns by damaging the cholinergic system of zebrafish, and suggest that zebrafish locomotor behavior and acetylcholinesterase can be used as indicators for investigating aphantoxins and blooms in nature."

Routine microbiological water quality testing highlights areas of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) contamination within the water column, but fails to consider the abundance of FIB in sediments, which under certain hydrodynamic conditions can become resuspended. Sediments can enhance the survival of FIB in estuarine environments, but the influence of sediment composition on the ecology and abundance of FIB is poorly understood. To determine the relationship between sediment composition (grain size and organic matter) and the abundance of pathogen indicator bacteria (PIB), sediments were collected from four transverse transects of the Conwy estuary, UK. The abundance of culturable Escherichia coli, total coliforms, enterococci, Campylobacter, Salmonella and Vibrio spp. in sediments was determined in relation to sediment grain size, organic matter content, salinity, depth and temperature. Sediments that contained higher proportions of silt and/or clay and associated organic matter content showed significant positive correlations with the abundance of PIB. Furthermore, the abundance of each bacterial group was positively correlated with the presence of all other groups enumerated. Campylobacter spp. were not isolated from estuarine sediments. Comparisons of the number of culturable E. coli, total coliforms and Vibrio spp. in sediments and the water column revealed that their abundance was 281, 433 and 58-fold greater in sediments (colony forming units (CFU)/100g) when compared with the water column (CFU/100ml), respectively. These data provide important insights into sediment compositions that promote the abundance of PIB in estuarine environments, with important implications for the modelling and prediction of public health risk based on sediment resuspension and transport."

The wide variety of ciguatoxins bio-accumulated in fish or shellfish responsible for this neurological illness are produced by marine dinoflagellates of the genus Gambierdiscus and bio-transformed through the food web. The evaluation of the contents of ciguatoxins in strains of Gambierdiscus relies on the availability of standards and on the development of sensitive and specific tools to detect them. There is a need for sensitive methods for the analysis of pacific ciguatoxins with high resolution mass spectrometry to ensure unequivocal identification of all congeners. We have applied a fractional factorial design of experiment 2^8-3 for the screening of the significance of eight parameters potentially influencing ionization and ion transmission and their interactions to evaluate the behavior of sodium adducts, protonated molecules and first water losses of CTX4A/B, CTX3B/C, 2-OH-CTX3C and 44-methylgambierone on a Q-TOF equipment. The four parameters that allowed to significantly increase the peak areas of ciguatoxins and gambierones (up to a factor ten) were the capillary voltage, the sheath gas temperature, the ion funnel low pressure voltage and the ion funnel exit voltage. The optimized method was applied to revisit the toxin profile of G. polynesiensis (strain TB92) with a confirmation of the presence of M-seco-CTX4A only putatively reported so far and the detection of an isomer of CTX4A. The improvement in toxin detection also allowed to obtain informative high resolution targeted MS/MS spectra revealing high similarity in fragmentation patterns between putative isomer (4) of CTX3C, 2-OH-CTX3C and CTX3B on one side and between CTX4A, M-seco-CTX4A and the putative isomer on the other side, suggesting a relation of constitutional isomerism between them for both isomers."

Differences among the results reported using the three methods were shown to be statistically significant, although visual comparisons showed an overlap between results generated by the majority of tests, the exception being the Pre-COX quantitation of N-hydroxylated toxins in post ion-exchange fractions. Intralaboratory repeatability and interlaboratory reproducibility were acceptable for most of the results, with the exception of results generated from fractions. The results provided good evidence for the acceptable performance of the PCOX method for the quantitation of C toxins.

PST levels in seawater exhibited the highest levels in the southeastern mouth of Laizhou Bay and decreased toward the inner bay. Correlation analyses showed that climatic factors, nutrient status and hydrological conditions had significant effects on the distribution of PST in mariculture bay. Preliminary environmental risk assessments revealed that aquatic organisms throughout the waters of Laizhou Bay are at risk of chronic PST toxicity.

This study evaluated the source specificity, sensitivity, occurrence and concentration of three viral MST markers i. e. cross-assembly phage (crAssphage), F-specific RNA bacteriophage genogroup II (F-RNA phage GII) and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) using animal faeces (n = 119; 16 animal groups), influent wastewater (n = 12), effluent wastewater (n = 16) and shellfish (n = 33). CrAssphage, F-RNA phage GII and PMMoV had source specific values of 0.97, 0.99 and 0.91, respectively. The sensitivity of MST markers was confirmed by their 100% detection frequency in influent wastewaters. The frequency of detection in effluent wastewater ranged from 81.3% (F-RNA phage GII) to 100% (PMMoV). Concentration of F-RNA phage GII was one log10 (influent wastewater) and 2-3 log10 (effluent wastewater) lower than crAssphage and PMMoV, respectively. Despite lower prevalence of F-RNA phage GII in oysters and mussels compared to crAssphage and PMMoV, concentrations of the three MST markers were similar in mussels. As an indicator of norovirus contamination in shellfish, crAssphage and PMMoV had greater predictive sensitivity (100%; [95% CI; 81.5%-100%)]) and F-RNA phage GII had greater predictive specificity (93.3%; [95% CI; 68.1%-99.8%]). In contrast, crAssphage and F-RNA phage GII have similar accuracy for predicting norovirus in shellfish, however, PMMoV significantly overestimated its presence. Therefore, a combination of crAssphage and F-RNA phage GII analysis of shellfish could provide a robust estimation of the presence of human faecal and norovirus contamination."

Recreational and Tribal-subsistence shellfish harvesters are known to regularly consume low levels of DA. The aim of this study was to determine if chronic low-level DA exposure, at doses below those that cause overt signs of neurotoxicity, has quantifiable impacts on cognitive function. To this end, female C57BL/6NJ mice were exposed to asymptomatic doses of DA (≈0.75mg/kg) or vehicle once a week for several months. Spatial learning and memory were tested in a radial water maze paradigm at one, six and 25 weeks of exposure, after a nine-week recovery period following cessation of exposure, and at three old age time points (18, 24 and 28 months old). Mice from select time points were also tested for activity levels in a novel cage environment using a photobeam activity system. Chronic low-level DA exposure caused significant spatial learning impairment and hyperactivity after 25 weeks of exposure in the absence of visible histopathological lesions in hippocampal regions of the brain. These cognitive effects were reversible after a nine-week recovery period with no toxin exposure and recovery was sustained into old age. These findings identify a new potential health risk of chronic low-level exposure in a mammalian model. Unlike the permanent cognitive impacts of acute exposure, the chronic low-level effects observed in this study were reversible suggesting that these deficits could potentially be managed through cessation of exposure if they also occur in human seafood consumers."

The health risk presented by this class of compounds was also assessed in relation to their intake via seafood consumption. Of the 34 PPCPs, a total of 9, 21, 14, and 28 PPCPs were detected in water, sediments, fish feeds, and aquatic organisms, respectively. Trimethoprim, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and spectinomycin were detected in all matrices. The levels of PPCPs in water and sediment samples were relatively low. Spectinomycin, paracetamol, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ibuprofen were the most frequently detected PPCPs in feeds. Ibuprofen and ketoprofen were widely detected in aquatic organisms, with average concentrations of 562 and 267 ng/g wet weight, respectively. The residual levels of PPCPs in shellfish such as ME (mussel, Mytilus edulis) and OS (oyster, Ostrea gigas) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those in other species including CA (topmouth culter, Culter alburnus) and EO (orbfish, Ephippus orbis). Correlation analysis indicated that the medicated feeds were a potential source of PPCPs in the mariculture areas of the PRD, but other anthropogenic sources should not be ignored. Based on maximum residue limits and acceptable daily intake, the health risks presented to humans via seafood consumption are negligible. However, as multiple antibiotics were frequently detected in the mariculture environment, aquatic organisms, and feeds, the induction and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance associated with antibiotic usage in aquaculture would be of great concern. It is necessary to establish a centralized management system and control the use of veterinary drugs in mariculture to protect the aquaculture environment and ensure the safety of seafood."

Currently the majority of PAH research focuses on benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), although a much greater range of PAH are known to have detrimental effects to human health. Monitoring a large number of PAH is expensive, time consuming and analytically demanding, yet there is currently no clear basis for determining which PAH should be monitored to give an indication of overall exposure. A thorough statistical examination of the relationships between different PAH in different foodstuffs has not previously been carried out. Using a test dataset of homogenised edible flesh from shellfish samples as a case study a modelling process using principal components analysis regression is proposed to determine which PAH subset (from a total of 27 monitored PAH) should be assessed as indicators for general PAH exposure. Multivariate ordination and clustering show that PAH concentrations of compounds of similar chemical structure can be highly correlated in the samples, e. g. the five ringed isomers PAHs benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[j]fluoranthene and benzo[k]fluoranthene. The model selection process determined which subsets of PAH can be used to predict the presence and abundance of other PAHs in shellfish samples. Models were more accurate in predicating PAHs concentrations of PAH where concentrations were measured above the limit of detection (LoD). PAH with values below the LoD were harder to predict accurately. The current analysis highlights that laboratories should focus on the following PAHs BaP, benzo[a]anthracene, benzo[g,h,i]perylene, phenanthrene, benzo[g,h,i]fluoranthene, chrysene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[b]fluoranthene and fluoranthene when analysing shellfish samples. Focussing monitoring on this group of PAH may give a better indication of overall PAH content of samples that the summed PAH indicator methods currently adopted."

Estuaries exist at the interface between freshwater and marine systems, and provide habitats for a diverse suite of species, including shellfish, fish, and birds. We provide baseline values for estuarine mudflats using sediment samples collected at Cowichan-Koksilah Estuary in British Columbia, Canada, a biologically-rich estuary. The estuary also contains a marine shipping terminal, forestry log sort area, and input of contaminants from nearby residential and agricultural areas. Microplastics, both fragments and fibers, occurred in 93% (13/14) of sediment samples. A mean of 6.8 microfibers/kg dw (range: 0-12 microfibers/kg dw) and 7.9 microfragments/kg (range: 0-19 fragments/kg dw) occurred in individual samples, and counts of fibers and fragments were strongly correlated (r = 0.78, p = 0.008, n = 14). The abundance of microplastics tended to be higher on the north side of the estuary that receives greater inputs from upland sources relative to the south side. Size distributions of microplastic fragments and fibers were similar to sediment grain size distribution with size categories 0.063 to 0.25 mm and 0.25 to 0.6 mm being the most common for plastics and sediment, indicating the occurrence of microplastics likely followed existing depositional processes within the estuary. Microplastics in sediments were composed of a variety of polymers, including high density polyethylene (HDPE), Nylon 6/6 (polyhexamethylene adipamide), and polyethylene terephthalate-PETE (poly(1,4-cyclohexylene dimethylene terephthalate)). This study indicates that microplastics occur throughout most of the Cowichan-Koksilah Estuary, and future studies should focus on the exposure risk and potential for bioaccumulation for wildlife species that feed on the surface of intertidal mudflats."

The objective of this study was to test and compare in vitro on human intestinal cells (Caco-2) the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) extracts (either hydrophilic or lipophilic) collected at two coastal sites; JL (neighboring a phosphate processing plat-form) and Oualidia (OL) (a vegetable growing area) located 160 km south of Casablanca (i. e. 40 km south of JL). Using Caco-2 cells, the following end-points have been evaluated, cytotoxicity as measured by MTS test, inhibition of cellular macromolecules syntheses (DNA and protein) and genotoxicity evaluated by DNA fragmentation in agarose gel electrophoresis. The results indicated, that hydrophilic and lipophilic OL mussels extracts are cytotoxic and inhibit cellular macromolecules syntheses. Moreover these extracts damage the DNA in Caco-2 cells. The lipophilic JL mussels extract is cytotoxic, inhibits cellular macromolecules syntheses, and damages the DNA in Caco-2 cells whereas the hydrophilic extract of JL mussels fails to inhibit protein synthesis and does not damage the DNA. This extract rather enhances protein synthesis, suggesting possible metallothioneins induction by metal ions. Altogether these in vitro data indicate that mussels collected from OL could be more harmful than those from JL even though the later is closer to the pollution site than OL. Nevertheless consumption of mussels from all these areas may present a risk for humans. Epidemiological studies will be needed for global risk assessment in humans living in these areas especially those consuming see food regularly."

The influence of environmental factors such as water temperature, salinity, and land runoff on the occurrence of these microbes was also included in this study. Enteric viruses were found in 50 to 60% of the mussel samples, and there were no pronounced differences between the samples from the three sites. E. coli counts exceeded the limit for category A for shellfish sanitary safety in 40% of the samples from the sites situated in fjords. However, at the site in the outer archipelago, this limit was exceeded only once, in March 2001, when extremely high levels of atypical indole-negative strains of E. coli were registered at all three sites. The environmental factors influenced the occurrence of viruses and phages differently, and therefore, it was hard to find a coexistence between them. This study shows that, for risk assessment, separate modeling should be done for every specific area, with special emphasis on environmental factors such as temperature and land runoff. The present standard for human fecal contamination, E. coli, seems to be an acceptable indicator of only local sanitary contamination; it is not a reliable indicator of viral contaminants in mussels. To protect consumers and get verification of ""clean"" mussels, it seems necessary to analyze for viruses as well. The use of a molecular index of the human contamination of Swedish shellfish underscores the need for reference laboratories with high-technology facilities."

Higher removal rate was observed for NOD (≈96%) compared to MCs (≈50%) from the water phase. Accumulation of toxins in M. edulis was fast, reaching up to 3.4 μg/g shellfish tissue four days after the end of the 3-days exposure period, with NOD (1.72 μg/g) and MC-LR (0.74 μg/g) as the dominant toxins, followed by MC-LF (0.35 μg/g) and MC-LW (0.31 μg/g). Following the end of the exposure period depuration was incomplete after 27 days (0.49 μg/g of MCs/NODs). MCs/NODs were also present in faecal material and extrapallial fluid after 24 h of exposure with MCs the main contributors to the total cyanotoxin load in faecal material and NOD in the extrapallial fluid. Maximum concentration of MCs/NODs accumulated in a typical portion of mussels (20 mussels, ≈4 g each) was beyond greater the acute, seasonal and lifetime tolerable daily intake. Even after 27 days of depuration, consuming mussels harvested during even short term harmful algae blooms in close proximity to shellfish beds might carry a high health risk, highlighting the need for testing."

A strong correlation (R(2)=0.82; p<0.001) between total Hg and total suspended solids in the water column suggests that particulate matter is a transport mechanism for Hg within the lagoon system. Total Hg in the sediments ranged from 27.5 to 90.5 ng Hg/g dry weight with no significant difference between the 2005 wet and dry seasons. There was a mild, but significant, correlation between total Hg and % carbon for the March 2005 sediment samples (R(2)=0.435; p=0.020), suggesting that Hg is associated with organic matter on the solid phase. Concentrations of total Hg in fish and shellfish harvested from the ALS ranged from 0.01 to 0.35 microg Hg/g wet. The levels of total Hg in hair ranged from 0.10 to 3.36 microg Hg/g (n=47) and 58% of the samples were above 1.00 microg Hg/g. The findings from this study suggest that individuals who frequently consume fish and shell fish containing low levels of Hg (<0.3 microg/g) can accumulate low to moderate body burdens of Hg, as indicated by hair Hg concentrations>1.0 microg/g, and may be at risk for experiencing low dose mercury toxicity."

Fibrous MPs (microfibres) are often reported as the most commonly encountered shape of particle. To estimate MP concentrations in seawater, samples are often collected using towed nets (generally 300-350-μm mesh) and may underestimate the amount of microfibres present, which may pass through the mesh due to their narrow width. We compared the potential microplastic particle (PMP) concentration estimates provided by two different seawater sampling methods conducted at three commercial shellfish farms and three unfarmed sites in Baynes Sound, British Columbia, Canada. The methods were: 10-L bucket samples sieved through 63-μm mesh in situ and subsequently filtered through an 8-μm polycarbonate membrane; and 1-L bulk samples collected in jars and subsequently filtered to 8 μm. The jar samples yielded PMP concentrations averaging approximately 8.5 times higher than the bucket samples per L of water (at the site level), largely driven by differences in the number of microfibres. There was no significant difference in PNP concentration between shellfish farms and unfarmed sites. An analysis of MP concentrations and mesh sizes reported in the literature suggests that using a 300-350-μm mesh may underestimate total MP concentrations by one to four orders of magnitude compared with samples that are filtered through much smaller mesh sizes (e. g. <100 μm), despite the effect of sample volume. Particles <300 μm in diameter make up a large component of MPs commonly found in fish and invertebrates. As such, common sampling practices fail to adequately measure a biologically relevant class of MPs, thereby undermining the ability to quantify ecological risk. We suggest that seawater sampling methods be designed to filter to <10 μm (the approximate width of many microfibres), either using pressurized pumps for large-volume samples, or by using sufficient replication of small-volume discrete samples."

Genomic DNA of putative Vibrio isolates was analyzed by whole genome sequencing for taxonomic identification and identification of virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes. The risk of Vibrio-related illnesses due to the consumption of contaminated seafood was assessed with Risk Ranger. Populations of presumptive Vibrio were 2.6 to 4.4 log MPN/g and correlated with season; Vibrio levels were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the summer. Fifteen Vibrio isolates were identified as Vibrio alginolyticus (five isolates), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (six isolates), Vibrio harveyi (two isolates), and Vibrio diabolicus (two isolates). Two of the six V. parahaemolyticus isolates (ST 2504 and ST 2505) from oysters harbored either the tdh gene for thermostable direct hemolysin or the trh gene for thermostable direct hemolysin-related hemolysin. In addition to virulence genes, the shellfish isolates also harbored genes encoding resistance to multiple antibiotics, including tetracycline, penicillin, quinolone, and β-lactams, thus arousing concern. The risk assessment predicted that an estimated 21 cases of V. parahaemolyticus-associated gastroenteritis could occur in the general population annually due to consumption of contaminated oysters.

The results showed the acute inhibition of nTiO2 on the algal growth, photosynthetic efficiency and esterase activity at all concentrations except 2 mg L-1. Nonetheless, they recovered after 13 days nTiO2 exposure from 20 to 80 mg L-1. The EC50 value increased from 85.1 mg L-1 in Day 4 to 140.9 mg L-1 in Day 13. The physiological recovery after prolonged exposure may result from the elimination of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), a combined outcome of increased nTiO2 aggregation and algal antioxidant defense mechanisms. This observation is supported by the immediately increased antioxidant enzyme activities, including the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities upon nTiO2 exposure. Moreover, the production of PSTs in A. tamarense significantly increased by 1.41-1.76 folds after chronic nTiO2 exposure at all tested concentrations (p < 0.05), which might also be an adaptive response for the microalgae to overcome the stresses. In particular, the proportions of highly-toxic PSTs analogues GTX2/3, STX and dcSTX were significantly increased upon nTiO2 exposure (p < 0.05). Hence, the chronic nTiO2 exposure might aggravate the ecological impact of HABs. Furthermore investigations on different HAB species, especially those toxin-producing ones, and detail physiological responses are obviously needed."

Since an extremely high number of virus particles are present in the feces during the acute gastroenteritis, methods based on electron microscopy, passive particle agglutination tests, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays are readily employed for clinical diagnosis. However, the sensitivity of these procedures is not high enough to detect the low number of viral particles sometimes present in the environment. In the case of environmental samples, amplification of viral nucleic acids by polymerase chain reaction assays coupled to reverse transcription (RT-PCR) has been increasingly applied to detect rotaviruses in water and shellfish samples. However, procedures based on molecular approaches have to face the drawback that they do not differentiate between infectious and noninfectious particles, which is of major relevance from the public health point of view. Virus propagation in cell culture prior to detection by immunological or molecular procedures accomplishes the dual purpose of increasing the amount of target material and incorporating an infectivity assay as well.

Specific and sensitive methods have been developed and validated for the determination of the most commonly occurring azaspiracid analogs. An LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer is a hybrid instrument that combines linear ion trap (LIT) mass spectrometry (MS) with high-resolution Fourier transform (FT) MS and this was exploited to perform simultaneous ultra-high-resolution full-scan MS analysis and collision-induced dissociation (CID) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Using the highest mass resolution setting (100,000 FWHM) in full-scan mode, the methodology was validated for the determination of six AZAs in mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) tissue extracts. Ultra-high mass resolution, together with a narrow mass tolerance window of ±2 mDa, dramatically improved detection sensitivity. In addition to employing chromatographic resolution to distinguish between the isomeric azaspiracid analogs, AZA1/AZA6 and AZA4/AZA5, higher energy collisionally induced dissociation (HCD) fragmentation on selected precursor ions were performed in parallel with full-scan FTMS. Using HCD MS/MS, most precursor and product ion masses were determined within 1 ppm of the theoretical m/z values throughout the mass spectral range and this enhanced the reliability of analyte identity. For the analysis of mussels (M. galloprovincialis), the method limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 0.010 µg/g using full-scan FTMS and this was comparable with the LOQ (0.007 µg/g) using CID MS/MS. The repeatability data were; intra-day RSD% (1.8-4.4%; n = 6) and inter-day RSD% (4.7-8.6%; n = 3). Application of these methods to the analysis of mussels (M. edulis) that were naturally contaminated with azaspiracids, using high-resolution full-scan Orbitrap MS and low-resolution CID MS/MS, produced equivalent quantitative data."

Analyses of NIST and BCR reference materials demonstrated the accuracy of this technique. The highest copper levels were found in dried fruit and legumes, followed by organ meats, molluscs and crustaceans, cephalopods, cereals and sausages, respectively. In cereals, legumes and fruit, copper levels increased significantly with increasing levels of protein and decreasing carbohydrate content (p < 0.001). In meat and meat by-products, copper concentrations found in organ meats were significantly higher (p < 0.01). In fresh fish products, copper levels in shellfish were significantly higher than those measured in fish (p < 0.001). In vegetables, the copper concentrations found in mushrooms were significantly higher (p < 0.005). Mean copper concentrations analysed in cheese were statistically higher than those determined in other dairy products (p < 0.01). In beverages, copper levels determined in rum and juices were significantly higher (p < 0.001). Beverages for which a vegetable component was directly used in their manufacturing process (juices, wines and beers) had statistically higher copper levels when compared with fresh drinks. The daily dietary intake (DDI) of copper in the Andalusian diet was 1979 mug day(-1) per person. Cereals, meat, meat by-products and vegetables are the food categories that are the main source of copper in the daily diet. Taking into account the dietary reference intakes and upper levels (900 and 10, 000 mug Cu day(-1) for healthy adults, respectively), the mean copper DDI found indicate that for most of healthy adult individuals from the area, no adverse effects occur in relation to copper nutrition (deficiency or toxicity). Potable waters supplied 53 mug day(-1), which constitutes on average 0.025% of the maximum tolerable daily intake of this element set by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee."

In this study, levels of Cu, Mn, Se and Zn have been determined in fresh, canned and frozen fish and shellfish products. A total of 485 samples of the 43 most frequently consumed fish and shellfish species in Andalusia (Southern Spain) were analyzed for essential elements content. The potential human health risks for the consumers and the nutritional value of the products analyzed were assessed. Furthermore, the mercury-selenium ratios and the selenium health benefit value (Se-HBVs) were calculated. The highest concentrations of Cu were found in crustaceans species (shrimp and prawn) as they have hemocyanin (a copper-containing protein) that functions as an oxygen-transport molecule. Mn levels were higher in canned bivalve molluscs, such as cockle and clam, and in fresh common sole. Concerning Se, two fresh predatory fish species (tuna and swordfish) presented the most remarkable concentrations of this element. The highest concentration of the essential metals analysed was found for Zn, especially in fresh and canned mussels. All the species analyzed showed beneficial Hg:Se ratios and Se-HBVs, except for the shark species (blue shark and cat shark) and gilt-head bream because of their high Hg levels and low Se content, respectively. Nevertheless, the biomagnification usually observed in hazardous metals such as Hg would not occur for the essential elements measured in predatory species. The estimated daily intakes of the elements studied represented very low percentages of their reference values, ranging from 0.1% (Se) to 3.9% (Cu) for person weighting 60 kg, so the intake of these elements through fish and shellfish would not pose any risk for the average consumer. Moreover, the contribution of fish and shellfish products to the recommended daily allowances and adequate intakes of these mineral elements ranges from 2.5% (Mn) to 25.4% (Se)."

In France, PnTXs were detected for the first time in 2011, in mussels from the Ingril lagoon (South of France, Mediterranean coast). Since then, analyses carried out in mussels from this lagoon have shown high concentrations of PnTXs for several months each year. PnTXs have also been detected, to a lesser extent, in mussels from other Mediterranean lagoons and on the Atlantic and Corsican coasts. In the French data, the main analog is PnTX G (low levels of PnTX A are also present in some samples). No cases of PnTXs poisoning in humans have been reported so far in France or anywhere else in the world. In mice, PnTXs induce acute neurotoxic effects, within a few minutes after oral administration. Clinical signs of toxicity include decreased mobility, paralysis of the hind legs, tremors, jumps and breathing difficulties leading to death by respiratory arrest at high doses. The French agency for food safety (ANSES) recently conducted a review of the state of knowledge related to PnTXs and V. rugosum. Based on (i) the clinical signs of toxicity in mice, (ii) the mode of action of PnTXs as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor competitive antagonists and (iii) knowledge on drugs and natural toxins with PnTX-related pharmacology, potential human symptoms have been extrapolated and proposed. In this work, a provisional acute benchmark value for PnTX G of 0.13 μg/kg bw per day has been derived from an oral acute toxicity study in mice. Based on this value and a large shellfish meat portion size of 400g, a concentration lower than 23 μg PnTX G/kg shellfish meat is not expected to result in adverse effects in humans. ANSES recommends taking into account PnTXs in the French official monitoring program for shellfish production and identified data gaps to refine health risk assessment."

The risk assessment indexes were developed with the methods of literature review, brainstorm and expert consultation, and the weights of indexes were calculated by the method of analytic hierarchy process. The established indexes contained the risk possibility, impacts of public health, population vulnerability and resilience. The relative risk indexes(integrated risk indexes) of different shellfish poisoning were computed by combining hierarchy process and TOPSIS methods. Moreover, the weights of indexes were further used to generate absolute risk values by multiplying indexes. Four primary indexes and 17 secondary indexes were identified for risk assessment of shellfish poisoning outbreak. Of 17 secondary indexes, the knowing rate of shellfish poisoning, medical accessibility, the number of people being affected, laboratory testing capacity and the habits of eating seafood of local residents had relatively large weights (0.0876, 0.0840, 0.0716, 0.0703 and 0.0644, respectively), which accounted for nearly 38% of the total weight. All consistency ratio (CR) were less than 0.1. The index system was applied in Cangnan county of Zhejiang province. The results showed the relative risk indexes of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP), neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP) and amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) were 0.4526, 0.7116, 0.1657 and 0.2884, and the absolute risk values were 0.2542, 0.2668, 0.1907 and 0.2184, respectively.

As well as its direct value, it helps to stabilize communities in rural areas characterized by limited job opportunities. It is also important for consumers who recognize shellfish as a healthy product that gains its nutrition from natural plankton without the need for fertilizers, chemical treatments or other anthropogenic intervention typical of terrestrial agriculture or other marine aquaculture. Nevertheless, global shellfish fisheries are under threat from harmful algal blooms (HABs) and related biotoxins, whose production is potentially exacerbated by global changes. This research provides evidence of economic impacts on Scottish shellfish farms in the last 10 years caused by HABs and their associated biotoxins. In contrast to previous approaches that have focused on variation in production as a function of temporal trends and blooms events, we use a production function approach to show which input factors (labour, capital, climate variables, concentration of biotoxins) have an effect on production. Results show that diarrhoetic shellfish toxins produced by the genera Dinophysis are most significant. A 1% change in the production of these biotoxins reduces shellfish production by 0.66%, with an average yearly negative variation in production of 15% (1,080 ton) and an economic loss (turnover) of £ (GBP) 1.37 m per year (in 2015 currency) over a national annual industry turnover of ~ £ 12 m. The production function approach is coupled with a multivariate time series model (VAR) capturing the statistical relationship between algal concentration, information on climatic variables and biotoxins to forecast the damage to shellfish production from HABs. This provides producers and regulators with the economic information to plan temporal and spatial mitigating measures necessary to limit damages to production by comparing the costs of these measures with the costs of lost production."

Among these biotoxins Okadaic Acid (OA) is of critical interest as it represents the most predominant Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning biotoxin in the European coasts. Furthermore, OA is a potent tumor promoter with aneugenic and clastogenic effects on the hereditary material, most notably DNA breaks and alterations in DNA repair mechanisms. Therefore, a great effort has been devoted to the biomonitoring of OA in the marine environment during the last two decades, mainly based on physicochemical and physiological parameters using mussels as sentinel organisms. However, the molecular genotoxic effects of this biotoxin make chromatin structure a good candidate for an alternative strategy for toxicity assessment with faster and more sensitive evaluation. To date, the development of chromatin-based studies to this purpose has been hampered by the complete lack of information on chromatin of invertebrate marine organisms, especially in bivalve molluscs. Our preliminary results have revealed the presence of histone variants involved in DNA repair and chromatin specialization in mussels and clams. In this work we use this information to put forward a proposal focused on the development of chromatin-based tests for OA genotoxicity in the marine environment. The implementation of such tests in natural populations has the potential to provide an important leap in the biomonitoring of this biotoxin. The outcome of such monitoring may have critical implications for the evaluation of DNA damage in these marine organisms. They will provide as well important tools for the optimization of their harvesting and for the elaboration of additional tests designed to evaluate the safety of their consumption and potential implications for consumer's health."

Sample extracts (crude extracts, CE) were obtained from algal cultures and their toxic potential was explored. Their OA (and derivatives) content was evaluated by two methods: one based on chemical analysis using HPLC-MS, the other based on screening the inhibiting effect on protein phosphatase PP2A. P. arenarium extracts inhibit PP2A and the active toxin was confirmed as being OA by HPLC-MS. In contrast, P. emarginatum showed negative results regardless of the method used. The development of medaka fish embryos kept in medium containing pure OA or Prorocentrum CE was examined. Survival rates were reduced up to 100% depending on the concentrations used of both OA and CE of P. arenarium, while no effect was observed with CE of P. emarginatum. Anatomopathological studies of surviving embryos indicate that OA treatment resulted in significant increases in liver and digestive tract areas compared to controls. P. arenarium treated surviving embryos exhibited significant quantitative increases of global body and vitellus areas. Together, our results indicate that the toxic effects to medaka embryos development of pure OA and P. arenarium extracts containing OA are distinguishable. The differences may indicate the presence of additional toxic substance(s) (or molecules able to modulate OA impact) in the P. arenarium CE that probably are not present in P. emarginatum."

Due to toxicological effects and geographical distribution, in European legislation relevant compounds are regulated, and their determination is accomplished with the reference liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. In this study a modified ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method has been developed for the identification and quantification of EU-regulated lipophilic toxins. The method optimization included a refinement of SPE-C18 clean-up, in order to reduce matrix interferences. Improved LC conditions and upgraded chromatographic ammonia-based gradient ensured the best separation of all analytes and, in particular, of the two structural isomers (OA and DTX2). Also, different MS parameters were tested, and confirmation criteria finally established. The validation studies confirmed that all parameters were satisfactory. The requirements for precision (RSD% < 11.8% for each compound), trueness (recoveries from 73 to 101%) and sensitivity (limits of quantification in the range 3−8 µg kg−1) were fulfilled. The matrix effect, ranging from −9 to 19%, allowed the use of a calibration curve in solvent (3−320 µg kg−1 in matrix) for quantification of real samples. Method relative uncertainty ranged from 12 to 20.3%. Additionally, a total of 1000 shellfish samples was analysed, providing a first preliminary surveillance study that may contribute to the knowledge of lipophilic marine toxins contamination. Increase in algae proliferation events and intoxication cases, EFSA suggestions for modification of maximum permitted levels and toxicity equivalency factors, and new studies of important toxic effects underline that implementation of reference methods still represents an important task for health and food safety laboratories."

To examine the dynamics and ecology of pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of V. parahaemolyticus and address the relevance of indicator bacteria in predicting V. parahaemolyticus concentrations, field surveys and experiments were carried out in western Long Island Sound, NY, USA, a region that has experienced recent outbreaks of shellfish contaminated with V. parahaemolyticus. Pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains were quantified via PCR detection of marker genes and most probable number techniques. Field survey data showed little correspondence between fecal coliforms and V. parahaemolyticus, but significant correlations between V. parahaemolyticus and an alternative indicator, enterococci, and between V. parahaemolyticus and short-term (48 h) rainfall were observed. Experiments demonstrated that enrichment of seawater with phytoplankton-derived dissolved organic matter significantly increased the concentration of total V. parahaemolyticus and the presence pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus, but higher temperatures did not. Collectively, these study results suggest that fecal coliforms may fail to account for the full suite of important shellfish pathogens but that enterococci could provide a potential alternative or supplement to shellfish sanitation monitoring.

The possible effects of co-produced PTXs or live cells of Dinophysis to aquatic organisms, however, are less understood. Effects on an early life stage of sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus), a common finfish in eastern USA estuaries, were evaluated using a 96-h toxicity bioassay. Three-week old larvae were exposed to PTX2 concentrations from 50 to 4000 nM, live Dinophysis acuminata culture (strain DAVA01), live cells resuspended in clean medium or culture filtrate. This D. acuminata strain produced mainly intracellular PTX2 (≈ 21 pg cell-1), with much lower levels of OA and dinophysistoxin-1. No mortality or gill damages were observed in larvae exposed to D. acuminata (from 5 to 5500 cells mL-1), resuspended cells and culture filtrate. However, exposure to purified PTX2 at intermediate to high concentrations (from 250 to 4000 nM) resulted in 8 to 100% mortality after 96 h (24-h LC50 of 1231 nM). Histopathology and transmission electron microscopy of fish exposed to intermediate to high PTX2 concentrations revealed important gill damage, including intercellular edema, necrosis and sloughing of gill respiratory epithelia, and damage to the osmoregulatory epithelium, including hypertrophy, proliferation, redistribution and necrosis of chloride cells. Tissue damage in gills is likely caused by the interaction of PTX2 with the actin cytoskeleton of the affected gill epithelia. Overall, the severe gill pathology observed following the PTX2 exposure suggested death was due to loss of respiratory and osmoregulatory functions in C. variegatus larvae."

They have been recognised as an important health risk for humans, animals, and ecosystems worldwide. The metabolic pathways that lead to the production and the degradation of these toxic metabolites are still unknown. In this study, we investigated the possible link between PST accumulation and the activation of the metabolism that leads to purine degradation in the filamentous freshwater cyanobacterium Planktothrix sp. FP1. The purine catabolic pathway is related to the nitrogen microcycle in water environments, in which cyanobacteria use traces of purines and ureides as a nitrogen source for growth. Thus, the activity of allantoicase, a key inducible enzyme of this metabolism, was used as tool for assaying the activation of the purine degradation pathway. The enzyme and the pathway were induced by allantoic acid, the direct substrate of allantoicase, as well as by adenine and, to a lower degree, by urea, one of the main products of purine catabolism. Crude cell extract of Escherichia coli was also employed and showed the best induction of allantoicase activity. In culture, Planktothrix sp. FP1 showed a differential accumulation of PST in consequence of the induction with different substrates. The cyanobacterial culture induced with allantoic acid accumulated 61.7% more toxins in comparison with the control. On the other hand, the cultures induced with adenine, urea, and the E. coli extract showed low PST accumulation, respectively, 1%, 38%, and 5% of the total toxins content detected in the noninduced culture. A degradation pathway for the PSTs can be hypothesised: as suggested for purine alkaloids in higher plants, saxitoxin (STX) and derivatives may also be converted into xanthine, urea, and further to CO2 and NH4+ or recycled in the primary metabolism through the purine degradation pathway."

In this paper, an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (icELISA) for detecting OA and DTX-1 in seafood was developed based on monoclonal antibody (McAb). The OA was conjugated to human immunoglobulin G (IgG) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) by the active ester method as the immune antigen and the detective antigen. The spleen cells from BALB/c mice immunized with OA-IgG were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells. A hybridoma cell line, which secreted McAb against OA, was selected by ""limiting dilution"" cloning. An icELISA was developed based on immobilized conjugate (OA-BSA) competing the McAb with the free OA in seafood sample. A hybridoma cell line, which secreted IgG1 subclass monoclonal antibody (McAb) against OA, was selected. The IC(50) of the McAb for OA and dinophytoxin-1 (DTX-1) were 4.40 and 3.89 ng/mL, respectively.

Its aetiology is unknown, though an early developmental insult is thought by some to be an important trigger. There is not a strong genetic predisposition; gene-environment interactions are more significant considerations. Environmental risk factors for TLE-HS are under-researched. Domoic acid (DA) is an environmental neurotoxin of algal origin that can contaminate marine food webs. DA can cross the placenta, is significantly more toxic to the developing brain compared to the adult brain, and has affected humans and marine wildlife through mass poisonings. DA coincidentally has a decades-long history of use as a chemical model of temporal lobe epilepsy, along with its close structural analogue kainic acid (also of algal origin). The principal hypothesis presented here is that dietary exposure to doses of DA that are sub-clinical in pregnant women may be sufficient to damage the foetal hippocampus and initiate epileptogenesis. The hypothesis could be tested both experimentally by in vivo proof-of-concept animal studies that expand on current knowledge of prenatal susceptibility to DA neurotoxicity, and by epidemiological investigations directed towards dietary exposure to marine food products. If only a small proportion of the attributable risk for TLE-HS is found to be due to gestational exposure to DA, the public health implications would still be of great significance, as this would represent a potentially preventable exposure. Other potent neurotoxins are produced by marine microalgae and freshwater cyanobacteria. These structurally and mechanistically diverse toxins can also contaminate water supplies, seafood and shellfish. Several operate by modulating ion channels, so may also be of interest to epilepsy researchers. DA is also the subject of preliminary scrutiny in strandings involving odontocete cetaceans. The implications of such work are discussed here."

The respiration rate of either bivalve was not significantly affected by toxin accumulation in the tissues. In contrast, the absorption efficiency of both clams and mussels decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner for mussels but not for clams, when the tissue accumulated the toxins. With an increase in paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxin burden, SFG in both clams and mussels was significantly reduced, primarily because of the decrease of absorption efficiency.

We found three paralogs of sxtA, domain A1, and a widespread distribution of sxtA1 in non-STX producing dinoflagellates, indicating duplication events in the evolution of this gene. One paralog, clade 2, of sxtA1 may be particularly related to STX biosynthesis. Similarly, sxtG appears to be generally restricted to STX-producing species, while three amidinotransferase gene paralogs were found in dinoflagellates. We investigated the role of positive (diversifying) selection following duplication in sxtA1 and sxtG, and found negative selection in clades of sxtG and sxtA1, clade 2, suggesting they were functionally constrained.

HAV contamination can be acute in coastal areas, such as Brittany, France, where outbreaks of hepatitis A have already occurred and have been linked to the consumption of raw shellfish. A quantitative probabilistic approach was carried out to estimate the mean annual risk of hepatitis A in an adult population of raw oyster consumers. Two hypothetical scenarios of contamination were considered, the first for a rare and brief event and the second for regular and prolonged episodes of contamination. Fourteen monitoring and management strategies were simulated. Their effects were assessed by the relative risk reduction in mean annual risk. The duration of closure after abnormal detection in the shellfish area was also considered. Among the strategies tested, results show that monthly molecular reverse transcription PCR monitoring of HAV is more useful than bacterial surveys. In terms of management measures, early closure of the shellfish area without waiting for confirmatory analysis was shown to be the most efficient strategy. When contamination is very short-lived and homogeneous in the shellfish production area, waiting for three negative results before reopening the area for harvest is time wasting. When contamination is not well identified or if contamination is heterogeneous, it can be harmful not to wait for three negative results. In addition, any preventive measures, such as improving sewage treatment or producing shellfish in safer areas, that can reduce contamination by at least 2 log units are more efficient and less costly. Finally we show that controlling and managing transferred shellfish are useful and can play an important role in preventing cases. Qualitative results from HAV monitoring can advantageously supplement other measures that improve the safety of shellfish products in exposed areas."

Shellfish were collected and subjected to analysis for ASP, PSP and lipophilic toxins, as well as a suite of non-EU regulated toxins such as tetrodotoxin and selected cyclic imines. Results revealed the presence of low levels of PSP toxins in oysters throughout the study period. Overall, total toxicities reached a maximum of 10% of the EU regulatory limit of 800 μg STX eq/kg. Toxin profiles were similar to those reported from the 1980 outbreak. No evidence was found for significant levels of ASP and lipophilic toxins, although some cyclic imines were detected, including gymnodimine. The results indicated that the risk to shellfish consumers during this specific study period would have been low. However, with historical evidence for extremely high levels of PSP toxins in molluscs, there is a strong need for routine surveillance of shellfish production areas for marine toxins, in order to mitigate against human health impacts resulting from unexpected harmful algal blooms, with potentially devastating socio-economic consequences."

The species Alexandrium taylorii is known to form recurrent and dense blooms in the Mediterranean, but its toxin production potential is poorly studied. Here we investigated toxin production potential of a Mediterranean A. taylorii clonal strain by combining state-of-the-art screening for various toxins known to be produced within Alexandrium with a sound morphological and molecular designation of the studied strain. As shown by a detailed thecal plate analysis, morphology of the A. taylorii strain AY7T from the Adriatic Sea conformed with the original species description. Moreover, newly obtained Large Subunit (LSU) and Internal Transcribed Spacers (ITS) rDNA sequences perfectly matched with the majority of other Mediterranean A. taylorii strains from the databases. Based on both ion pair chromatography coupled to post-column derivatization and fluorescence detection (LC-FLD) and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis it is shown that A. taylorii AY7T does not produce paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) above a detection limit of ca. 1 fg cell-1, and also lacks any traces of spirolides and gymnodimines. The strain caused cell lysis of protistan species due to poorly characterized lytic compounds, with a density of 185 cells mL-1 causing 50% cell lysis of cryptophyte bioassay target cells (EC50). As shown here for the first time A. taylorii AY7T produced goniodomin A (GDA) at a cellular level of 11.7 pg cell-1. This first report of goniodomin (GD) production of A. taylorii supports the close evolutionary relationship of A. taylorii to other identified GD-producing Alexandrium species. As GD have been causatively linked to fish kills, future studies of Mediterranean A. taylorii blooms should include analysis of GD and should draw attention to potential links to fish kills or other environmental damage."

Its detection in seafood is currently performed as a consequence of using the Association of Analytical Communities (AOAC) mouse bioassay (MBA) for paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins, but TTX is not monitored routinely in Europe. Due to ethical and performance-related issues associated with this bioassay, the European Commission has recently published directives extending procedures that may be used for official PSP control. An AOAC-accredited high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has now been accepted by the European Union as a first action screening method for PSP toxins to replace the MBA. However, this AOAC HPLC method is not capable of detecting TTX, so this potent toxin would be undetected; thereby, a separate method of analysis is required. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) optical biosensor technology has been proven as a potential alternative screening method to detect PSP toxins in seafood. The addition of a similar SPR inhibition assay for TTX would complement the PSP assay in removing the MBA. The present report describes the development and single laboratory validation in accordance with AOAC and IUPAC guidelines of an SPR method to be used as a rapid screening tool to detect TTX in the sea snail Charonia lampas lampas, a species which has been implicated in 2008 in the first case of human TTX poisoning in Europe. As no current regulatory limits are set for TTX in Europe, single laboratory validation was undertaken using those for PSP toxins at 800 μg/kg. The decision limit (CCα) was 100 μg/kg, with the detection capability (CCβ) found to be ≤200 μg/kg. Repeatability and reproducibility were assessed at 200, 400, and 800 μg/kg and showed relative standard deviations of 8.3, 3.8, and 5.4% and 7.8, 8.3, and 3.7% for both parameters at each level, respectively.

Filter-feeding bivalve mollusks, such as oysters and mussels, filter large volumes of water and thus concentrate such pathogens, which makes these bivalves potential vectors of disease. To assess the risk of infection from consumption of contaminated bivalves, parasite numbers and parasite recovery data are required. A modified immunomagnetic separation (IMS) procedure was used to determine Cryptosporidium oocyst and Giardia cyst numbers in individually homogenized oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and mussels (Mytilus edulis). About 12% of the commercial bivalves were positive, with low (oo)cyst numbers per specimen. The recovery efficiency of the IMS procedure was systematically evaluated. Experiments included seeding of homogenized bivalves and whole animals with 100 to 1,000 (oo)cysts. Both seeding procedures yielded highly variable recovery rates. Median Cryptosporidium recoveries were 7.9 to 21% in oysters and 62% in mussels. Median Giardia recoveries were 10 to 25% in oysters and 110% in mussels. Giardia recovery was significantly higher than Cryptosporidium recovery. (Oo)cysts were less efficiently recovered from seeded whole animals than from seeded homogenates, with median Cryptosporidium recoveries of 5.3% in oysters and 45% in mussels and median Giardia recoveries of 4.0% in oysters and 82% in mussels. Both bivalve homogenate seeding and whole animal seeding yielded higher (oo)cyst recovery in mussels than in oysters, likely because of the presence of less shellfish tissue in IMS when analyzing the smaller mussels compared with the larger oysters, resulting in more efficient (oo)cyst extraction. The data generated in this study may be used in the quantitative assessment of the risk of infection with Cryptosporidium or Giardia associated with the consumption of raw bivalve mollusks.

This study consequently targeted the preparation of a mussel tissue reference material incurred with a range of microcystin analogues and nodularins. Nine targeted analogues were incorporated into the material as confirmed through liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), with an additional 15 analogues detected using LC coupled to non-targeted high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Toxins in the reference material and additional source tissues were quantified using LC-MS/MS, two different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods and with an oxidative-cleavage method quantifying 3-methoxy-2-methyl-4-phenylbutyric acid (MMPB). Correlations between the concentrations quantified using the different methods were variable, likely relating to differences in assay cross-reactivities and differences in the abilities of each method to detect bound toxins. A consensus concentration of total soluble toxins determined from the four independent test methods was 2425 ± 575 µg/kg wet weight. A mean 43 ± 9% of bound toxins were present in addition to the freely extractable soluble form (57 ± 9%). The reference material produced was homogenous and stable when stored in the freezer for six months without any post-production stabilization applied. Consequently, a cyanotoxin shellfish reference material has been produced which demonstrates the feasibility of developing certified seafood matrix reference materials for a large range of cyanotoxins and could provide a valuable future resource for cyanotoxin risk monitoring, management and mitigation."

The ability of the procedure to quantify a wide range of tdh(+) V. parahaemolyticus levels was evaluated by testing shellfish samples in Japan and southern Thailand, where shellfish products are known to contain relatively low and high levels of total V. parahaemolyticus, respectively. The Japanese and Thai shellfish samples showed, respectively, relatively low (< 3 to 11 MPN/10 g) and considerably higher (930 to 110,000 MPN/10 g) levels of tdh(+) V. parahaemolyticus, raising concern about the safety of Thai shellfish products sold to domestic consumers at local morning markets. LAMP showed similar or higher performance than conventional PCR in the detection and quantification of a wide range of tdh(+) V. parahaemolyticus levels in shellfish products.

Synthesized AuNP were conjugated with biotinylated aptamers, using the biotin-streptavidin interaction, to make the specific detection of target allergens. Functionalized AuNP are incubated with the sample and are absorbed by graphene oxide (GO), creating GO-AuNP complexes, if the aptamers have not become structured due to conjugation with allergenic proteins. The PAD device is used to filter the resultant mixture which provides superior sensitivity to detect the allergens present down to the nanogram range (allergens were measured from 25 nM - 1000 nM with a LOD of 7.8 nM, 12.4 nM and 6.2 nM for peanut, milk and shrimp allergens respectively), in contrast to the microgram range of commonly used enzymatic immunoassays. The simple color indicator, varying from clear to pink in the presences of allergens allows the readout to be utilized without the need for highly specific equipment or training. Alternatively, the results can be quantified by taking a picture and measuring the color.

The THg and MeHg levels in different parts of the same sample species were in the order of muscle ≥ skin/shell > roe, whereas Se levels were much higher in roe. Concentrations of THg, MeHg, and Se in the muscles were between 2.27-154, 0.36-135, and 57.8-1.20 × 103 ng g-1 wet weight (ww), respectively. Although significant differences in analyte concentrations were not observed among cities, they existed among three species; marine fish, freshwater fish, and shellfish. Shellfish had generally lower Hg content (mean: 20.2 ng g-1 ww THg, 6.71 ng g-1 ww MeHg, and 30.9% MeHg/THg ratio); however it had higher Se content (528 ng g-1 ww) than the other types of fish (mean: 33.3 ng g-1 ww THg, 28.2 ng g-1 ww MeHg, and 79.2% MeHg/THg ratio, 257 ng g-1 ww Se). In addition to species, the individual growth and HgSe interaction influenced Hg distribution. Evident correlations were observed between several individual body features and Hg content, and between Se and THg concentrations (p < 0.05). The greater correlation coefficient between two elements for fish indicated stronger HgSe antagonism through HgSe compound formation in fish. Relatively low THg daily intakes (mean 0.013-0.080 μg kg-1 day-1) and MeHg daily intakes (0.006-0.065 μg kg-1 day-1) along with Se:Hg molar ratios >1 and positive HBVSe values suggest that aquatic products from these sites will not pose immediate health problems to consumers. Fish was the dominating contributor for MeHg intake whereas shellfish was the dominating contributor for Se intake. To safeguard against mercury exposure, residents in these areas can appropriately increase shellfish intake (especially bivalves), rather than exclusively consuming marine fish."

YTX provided the main SERS feature surprisingly similar to DTX-1 and DTX-2, suggesting similar molecular adsorption mechanism with respect to the AgNPs. A fingerprint SERS band at 1017 cm-1 characteristic for the C-CH3 stretching in DTX-1 and DTX-2 and absent in OA SERS signal, allowed direct SERS discrimination of DTX-1,2 from OA. In acid form or as dissolved potassium salt, OA showed reproducible SERS feature for 0.81 μM to 84.6 nM concentrations respectively, while its ammonium salt slightly changed the overall SERS signature. The inherently strong fluorescence of the shellfish tissue, which hampers Raman spectroscopy analysis, further increases when toxins are present in tissue. Through SERS, tissue fluorescence is partially quenched. Artificially intoxicated mussel tissue with DSP toxins and incubated with AgNPs allowed direct SERS evidence of the toxin presence, opening a novel avenue for the in situ shellfish tracking and warning via micro-SERS. Natural toxic tissue containing 57.91 μg kg-1 YTX (LC-MS confirmed) was micro-SERS assessed to validate the new algorithm for toxins detection. We showed that a portable Raman system was able to reproduce the lab-based SERS results, being suitable for in situ raw seafood screening. The new approach provides an attractive, faster, effective and low-cost alternative for seafood screening, with economic, touristic and sustainable impact in aquaculture, fisheries, seafood industry and consumer trust."

In marine ecosystems, climate change (warming and freshening from land run-off) will increase water column stratification which is favorable for toxin producing dinoflagellates. This can increase the prevalence of toxic microalgal species, leading to bioaccumulation of toxins by filter feeders, such as bivalves, with resultant negative impacts on physiological performance. In this study we manipulated multiple climate drivers (warming, freshening, and acidification), and the availability of toxic microalgae, to determine their impact on the physiological health, and toxin load of the tropical filter-feeding clam, Meretrix meretrix. Using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach, we found that exposure to projected marine climates resulted in direct negative effects on metabolic and immunological function and, that these effects were often more pronounced in clams exposed to multiple, rather than single climate drivers. Furthermore, our study showed that these physiological responses were modified by indirect effects mediated through the food chain. Specifically, we found that when bivalves were fed with a toxin-producing dinoflagellate (Alexandrium minutum) the physiological responses, and toxin load changed differently and in a non-predictable way compared to clams exposed to projected marine climates only. Specifically, oxygen consumption data revealed that these clams did not respond physiologically to climate warming or the combined effects of warming, freshening and acidification. Our results highlight the importance of quantifying both direct and, indirect food chain effects of climate drivers on a key tropical food species, and have important implications for shellfish production and food safety in tropical regions."

As well as their potential impacts on human health, toxin exposure from harmful algal blooms (HABs) has resulted in widespread morbidity and mortality in marine life, including top marine predators. There is therefore a need for an improved understanding of the trophic transfer, and persistence of toxins in marine food webs. For the first time, the concentrations of two toxin groups of commercial and environmental importance, domoic acid (DA) and saxitoxin (including Paralytic Shellfish Toxin (PST) analogues), were measured in the viscera of 40 different fish species caught in Scotland between February and November, 2012 to 2019. Overall, fish had higher concentrations of DA compared to PSTs, with a peak in the summer / autumn months. Whole fish concentrations were highest in pelagic species including Atlantic mackerel and herring, key forage fish for marine predators including seals, cetaceans and seabirds. The highest DA concentrations were measured along the east coast of Scotland and in Orkney. PSTs showed highest concentrations in early summer, consistent with phytoplankton bloom timings. The detection of multiple toxins in such a range of demersal, pelagic and benthic fish prey species suggests that both the fish, and by extension, piscivorous marine predators, experience multiple routes of toxin exposure. Risk assessment models to understand the impacts of exposure to HAB toxins on marine predators therefore need to consider how chronic, low-dose exposure to multiple toxins, as well as acute exposure during a bloom, could lead to potential long-term health effects ultimately contributing to mortalities. The potential synergistic, neurotoxic and physiological effects of long-term exposure to multiple toxins require investigation in order to appropriately assess the risks of HAB toxins to fish as well as their predators."

A total of 400 shellfish samples (mussels, oysters, clams, and scallops) from 2009 to 2012 were tested using the International Organization for Standardization standard 21872-1 method and PCR for the species-specific toxR gene. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was determined using a microbroth dilution method. V. parahaemolyticus was identified in 70 (17.5%) of the 400 samples, and the toxR gene was confirmed in 64 (91.4%) of these isolates. Most of the isolates were recovered from clams (31 isolates; 48.4% prevalence) followed by mussels (17 isolates; 26.6% prevalence). More V. parahaemolyticus-positive samples were found between May and September (22.7% prevalence) than between October and April (11.4% prevalence). Antibiotic profiling revealed that most isolates were resistant to ampicillin (56 isolates; 87.5%) and to streptomycin (45 isolates; 70.3%), but all of them were susceptible to tetracycline and chloramphenicol. Forty-one isolates (64.1%) were resistant to two or more antimicrobials; however, only one isolate (1.6%) was resistant to three antimicrobial classes. The antimicrobials used in treatment of human V. parahaemolyticus infection had high efficacy against the bacterial isolates tested.

The AdVs/NoVs in the water and shellfish samples were isolated by the membrane filtration and direct elution methods. The RNA of NoVs was reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA through reverse transcription reaction. Further NoVs and AdVs were detected using nested PCR. A higher detection rate was recorded in the low-temperature period than high-temperature. Detection difference was noted between nested PCR and qPCR outcomes for AdVs. The total detection rate of AdVs was higher in the water samples (COBF-40.6%, FP 20%) than the shellfish samples (COBF-11.7% and FP 6.3%). The AdVs load in the water and shellfish samples ranged from 1.23 × 103 to 1.00 × 106 copies/L and 3.57 × 103 to 4.27 × 104 copies/100g, respectively.

No significant differences were observed between the presence of AdVs, and all of the water quality parameters evaluated (heterotrophic plate count, water temperature, turbidity, pH, salinity, and dissolved oxygen). The virus contamination occurs mainly due to the direct discharge of domestic sewage, livestock farm, and fishing market wastewater into the coastal environment.

Skin mucus of IRL southern puffer fish captive for 1-year was highly toxic compared to Florida Gulf coast puffer fish. Therefore, we confirm puffer fish to be a hazardous reservoir of STXs in Florida's marine waters and implicate the dinoflagellate P. bahamense as the putative toxin source. Associated with fatal paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) in the Pacific but not known to be toxic in the western Atlantic, P. bahamense is an emerging public health threat. We propose characterizing this food poisoning syndrome as saxitoxin puffer fish poisoning (SPFP) to distinguish it from PFP, which is traditionally associated with tetrodotoxin, and from PSP caused by STXs in shellfish."

We show that within the UK, outbreaks of shellfish poisoning are rare but occurring on a yearly basis in different regions and affecting a diverse range of molluscan shellfish and other marine organisms. We also show that the abundance of a species does not necessarily correlate to the rate of toxic events. Based on routine hospital records, the numbers of shellfish poisonings in the UK are very low, but the identification of the toxin involved, or even a confirmation of a poisoning event is extremely difficult to diagnose. An effective shellfish monitoring system, which shuts down aquaculture sites when toxins exceed regularity limits, has clearly prevented serious impact to human health, and remains the only viable means of monitoring the potential threat to human health. However, the closure of these sites has an adverse economic impact, and the monitoring system does not include all toxic plankton. The possible geographic spreading of toxic microalgae species is therefore a concern, as warmer waters in the Atlantic could suit several species with southern biogeographical affinities enabling them to occupy the coastal regions of the UK, but which are not yet monitored or considered to be detrimental."

Minimising shellfish norovirus levels is therefore important for both the consumer's protection and the shellfish industry's reputation. One method used to reduce microbiological risks in shellfish is depuration; however, this process also presents additional costs to industry. Providing a mechanism to estimate norovirus levels during depuration would therefore be useful to stakeholders. This paper presents a mathematical model of the depuration process and its impact on norovirus levels found in shellfish. Two fundamental stages of norovirus depuration are considered: (i) the initial distribution of norovirus loads within a shellfish population and (ii) the way in which the initial norovirus loads evolve during depuration. Realistic assumptions are made about the dynamics of norovirus during depuration, and mathematical descriptions of both stages are derived and combined into a single model. Parameters to describe the depuration effect and norovirus load values are derived from existing norovirus data obtained from U. K. harvest sites. However, obtaining population estimates of norovirus variability is time-consuming and expensive; this model addresses the issue by assuming a 'worst case scenario' for variability of pathogens, which is independent of mean pathogen levels. The model is then used to predict minimum depuration times required to achieve norovirus levels which fall within possible risk management levels, as well as predictions of minimum depuration times for other water-borne pathogens found in shellfish. Times for Escherichia coli predicted by the model all fall within the minimum 42 hours required for class B harvest sites, whereas minimum depuration times for norovirus and FRNA+ bacteriophage are substantially longer. Thus this study provides relevant information and tools to assist norovirus risk managers with future control strategies."

Later studies of the possible impact of yessotoxin on the activity of alkaline phosphatase allowed to exclude them from this group. Yessotoxin causes a violation of calcium entry in the cells, which, in turn, effects the calcium-calmodulin system and thus influences into homeostasis of the organism as a whole. It was shown that yessotoxin induces a biphasic change in the concentration of adenosine monophosphate, an initial increase with a subsequent relative decrease, within some minutes after adding the toxin to the lymphocytes cell culture. Yessotoxin has effects on immune system; which is manifested in an increase of cytokines level, by inducing the expression of the genes encoding them. Yessotoxin have impact into processes of cell adhesion via E-cadherin and, thus, could be an important factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease. It has been established that yessotoxin caused the development of apoptosis. In those cases all three mechanisms of cell death took place - apoptosis, paraptosis and autophagy. Yessotoxin's acute toxicity doses according to different data are from 100 to 500-750 μg per 1kg of body weight. Yessotoxin's acute reference dose (ARfD) - 25 μg/kg of body weight per day. The results of the analysis of yessotoxin level in shellfish meat showed that none of the studied samples contained more than 3.75 mg yessotoxin equivalents/kg shellfish meat. This level has been adopted by the European Union as the maximum acceptable level of yessotoxin in shellfish meat (EU Regulation N 786/2013). Presented data on the mechanism of action, toxicity and prevalence of yessotoxins make it necessary to establish regulations of their content in seafood, placed on the markets of the Eurasian Economic Union."

Seafood samples were collected at five fishing sites in the Yucatán Peninsula (Mexico) during February and March 2018. In general, organotins were detected in all samples, suggesting a widespread occurrence of these compounds in the investigated region. The average concentration of total organotins in the muscle of demersal fish (Lutjanus synagris, Lutjanus campechanus, Calamus pennatula, Haemulon plumierii, Rhomboplites aurorubens), pelagic fish (Euthynnus alletteratus, and Opisthonema oglinum), gastropods (Melongena bispinosa and Strombus pugilis), oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and shrimp (Penaeus duorarum) was 146.7 ± 76.2, 93.1 ± 92.6, 61.0 ± 53.0, 76.7 ± 2.6, and 28.8 ± 2.7 ng Sn g-1 dry weight, respectively. Overall, MPhT among PhTs was the dominant compound in fish, while TBT among BTs was the dominant compound in shellfish. Regarding the toxic OTCs, TBT followed by DBT were the predominant compounds in all seafood species, while TPhT was below the quantification limit in most samples. The estimated daily intake values were lower than the tolerable daily intake (TDI) for the sum of organotins established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Furthermore, the hazard quotients (HQ) and hazard indices (HI) values were all lower than 1, suggesting that daily exposure to these levels of organotins is unlikely to cause any harm to the human health of seafood consumers at the Yucatán Peninsula. Thus, consumers may not be at risk through the inclusion of these investigated seafood species in their normal diet. However, due to the increasing coastal urbanization, maritime activities, and the likely illegal use of tin-based paints in Mexico, additional monitoring is needed to assess organotin levels in other regions along the Mexican coastal zone and using other seafood species."

While attention has focused on self-caught fish, most of the fish eaten by the American public comes from commercial sources. We sampled 11 types of fish and shellfish obtained from supermarkets and specialty fish markets in New Jersey and analyzed them for arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, mercury, and selenium. We test the null hypothesis that metal levels do not vary among fish types, and we consider whether the levels of any metals could harm the fish themselves or their predators or pose a health risk for human consumers. There were significant interspecific differences for all metals, and no fish types had the highest levels of more than two metals. There were few significant correlations (Kendall tau) among metals for the three most numerous fish (yellowfin tuna, bluefish, and flounder), the correlations were generally low (below 0.40), and many correlations were negative. Only manganese and lead positively were correlated for tuna, bluefish, and flounder. The levels of most metals were below those known to cause adverse effects in the fish themselves. However, the levels of arsenic, lead, mercury, and selenium in some fish were in the range known to cause some sublethal effects in sensitive predatory birds and mammals and in some fish exceeded health-based standards. The greatest risk from different metals resided in different fish; the species of fish with the highest levels of a given metal sometimes exceeded the human health guidance or standards for that metal. Thus, the risk information given to the public (mainly about mercury) does not present a complete picture. The potential of harm from other metals suggests that people not only should eat smaller quantities of fish known to accumulate mercury but also should eat a diversity of fish to avoid consuming unhealthy quantities of other heavy metals. However, consumers should bear in mind that standards have a margin of safety."

While blooms of harmful algae have frequently been linked to excessive nutrient loading, Dinophysis is a mixotrophic alga whose growth is typically associated with prey availability. Consequently, field studies of Dinophysis and nutrients have been rare. Here, the temporal dynamics of Dinophysis acuminata blooms, DSP toxins, and nutrients (nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, silicate, organic compounds) were examined over four years within two New York estuaries (Meetinghouse Creek and Northport Bay). Further, changes in the abundance and toxicity of D. acuminata were assessed during a series of nutrient amendment experiments performed over a three year period. During the study, Dinophysis acuminata blooms exceeding one million cells L-1 were observed in both estuaries. Highly significant (p<0.001) forward stepwise multivariate regression models of ecosystem observations demonstrated that D. acuminata abundances were positively dependent on multiple environmental parameters including ammonium (p = 0.007) while cellular toxin content was positively dependent on ammonium (p = 0.002) but negatively dependent on nitrate (p<0.001). Nitrogen- (N) and phosphorus- (P) containing inorganic and organic nutrients significantly enhanced D. acuminata densities in nearly all (13 of 14) experiments performed. Ammonium significantly increased cell densities in 10 of 11 experiments, while glutamine significantly enhanced cellular DSP content in 4 of 5 experiments examining this compound. Nutrients may have directly or indirectly enhanced D. acuminata abundances as densities of this mixotroph during experiments were significantly correlated with multiple members of the planktonic community (phytoflagellates and Mesodinium). Collectively, this study demonstrates that nutrient loading and more specifically N-loading promotes the growth and toxicity of D. acuminata populations in coastal zones."

In addition, we discuss a novel approach to developing monitoring tools for NSP toxins in molluscan shellfish. NSP is a seafood-borne disease caused by the consumption of brevetoxin-contaminated shellfish. Brevetoxins are a suite of cyclic polyether compounds found in blooms of the marine dinoflagellate Karenia brevis (K. brevis) and are potent neurotoxins. Preventive controls for NSP in the U. S. currently rely upon environmental monitoring of K. brevis blooms and assessment of their shellfish toxicity by mouse bioassay. The mouse bioassay for NSP approved by National Shellfish Sanitation Program was developed in the 1960s when very little information on the structural and toxicological properties of brevetoxins in algae and shellfish was available. Alternative methods to mouse bioassay based on current scientific knowledge in the area are needed for monitoring NSP toxins. It is now established that brevetoxins are metabolized extensively in shellfish. Algal brevetoxins undergo oxidation and reduction, as well as conjugation with fatty acids and amino acids in shellfish. Recently, three metabolites have been identified as biomarkers of brevetoxin exposure and toxicity in Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and hard clam (Mercenaria sp. ). The role of these biomarkers in monitoring NSP toxins in K. brevis exposed molluscan shellfish is reviewed. Comparisons of biomarker levels by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with composite toxin as measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and shellfish toxicity by mouse bioassay, support the application of these biomarkers as a dynamic and powerful approach for monitoring brevetoxins in shellfish and prevention of NSP."

Exposure to methylmercury affects children at different stages of brain development, including during adolescence. The objective was to examine seafood consumption and blood mercury concentrations in US youth.

Log-linear regression was used to examine the association between frequency of specific seafood consumption and blood mercury concentration, adjusting for race/Hispanic origin, sex, and age. In 2009-2012, 62.4% ± 1.4% (percent ± SE) of youth consumed any seafood in the preceding month; 38.4% ± 1.4% and 48.5% ± 1.5% reported consuming shellfish and fish, respectively. In 2009-2012, the geometric mean blood mercury concentration was 0.50 ± 0.02 μg/L among seafood consumers and 0.27 ± 0.01 μg/L among those who did not consume seafood.

Out of more than 80 Dinophysis species recorded so far, D. cf. acuminata is the most commonly observed in coastal areas worldwide. Due to their highly similar morphological features, however, an accurate discrimination of the various D. cf. acuminata species such as D. acuminata, D. ovum, and D. sacculus under light microscopy has proven to be a difficult task to accomplish. Hence, these species have thus far been referred to as the ""Dinophysis acuminata complex"". Recent studies showed a discrimination between local strains of D. acuminata and D. ovum from Galician, northwestern Spain, using the mitochondrial cox1 gene as a genetic marker in addition to commonly used morphological features such as size and contour of the large hypothecal plates, shape of the small cells formed as part of their polymorphic life-cycle, development of the left sulcal list and ribs, and length of the right sulcal list. In the present study, attempts were made to discriminate between D. acuminata and D. ovum following single-cell isolation of 54 ""D. acuminata complex"" collected from Korean coastal waters, based on the abovementioned traits. Morphological data showed that all the traits analyzed overlapped between the two species. The mitochondrial cox1 (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) gene sequences of every isolate were also determined, but a genetic distinction between D. acuminata and D. ovum could not be confirmed, suggesting that the cox1 gene is not a suitable genetic marker for discrimination between the two species. The results of this study suggest that the morphological variations observed within the ""D. acuminata complex"" may have been caused by several factors (e. g. different geographical locations, seasonal changes, and different environmental conditions), and that D. acuminata and D. ovum may be the same species."

PSTs accumulate into harvested shellfish species, such as the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, and can cause strong disorders to consumers at high doses. The impacts of Alexandrium minutum on C. gigas have often been attributed to its production of PSTs without testing separately the effects of the bioactive extracellular compounds (BECs) with allelopathic, hemolytic, cytotoxic or ichthyotoxic properties, which can also be produced by these algae. The BECs, still uncharacterized, are excreted within the environment thereby impacting not only phytoplankton, zooplankton but also marine invertebrates and fishes, without implicating any PST. The aim of this work was to compare the effects of three strains of A. minutum producing either only PSTs, only BECs, or both PSTs and BECs, on the oyster C. gigas. Behavioral and physiological responses of oysters exposed during 4 days were monitored and showed contrasted behavioral and physiological responses in oysters supposedly depending on produced bioactive substances. The non-PST extracellular-compound-producing strain primarily strongly modified valve-activity behavior of C. gigas and induced hemocyte mobilization within the gills, whereas the PST-producing strain caused inflammatory responses within the digestive gland and disrupted the daily biological rhythm of valve activity behavior. BECs may therefore have a significant harmful effect on the gills, which is one of the first organ in contact with the extracellular substances released in the water by A. minutum. Conversely, the PSTs impact the digestive gland, where they are released and mainly accumulated, after degradation of algal cells during digestion process of bivalves. This study provides a better understanding of the toxicity of A. minutum on oyster and highlights the significant role of BECs in this toxicity calling for further chemical characterization of these substances."

From that period are the most of 77 collected BMS samples, represented by mussels, oysters and warty venus clams harvested along the Dalmatian coast. All samples were processed according to EN ISO 15216-1 2017 using Mengovirus as a whole process control. SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed by real-time and conventional RT-PCR assays targeting E, N and nsp14 protein genes complemented with nsp14 partial sequencing. Rotavirus A (RVA) real-time RT-PCR assay was implemented as an additional evaluation criterion of virus concentration techniques. The results revealed the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in nine influents and two secondary treatment effluents from eight WWTPs, while all samples from the start of epidemic (wastewaters, surface waters) were negative which was influenced by sampling strategy. All tertiary effluents and BMS were SARS-CoV-2 negative. The results of RVA amplification were beneficial in evaluating virus concentration techniques and provided insights into RVA dynamics within the environment and community. In conclusion, the results of the present study confirm SARS-CoV-2 circulation in Croatian wastewaters during the second epidemic wave while extending the knowledge on wastewater treatment potential in SARS-CoV-2 removal.

Therefore, accurate and early identification of toxic phytoplankton species is crucial in HABs surveillance programs that allow fish-farmers to take appropriate preventive measures in shellfish harvesting and other aquaculture activities to overcome the negative impacts of HABs on human health. The identification of toxic dinoflagellates present in the water is currently a time-consuming operation since it requires skillful taxonomists and toxicologists equipped with optical and scanning electron microscopes as well as sophisticated equipment, for example, high-performance liquid chromotography-fluorescence detection. In this paper, a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE)-based proteomic approach was applied to discriminate between toxic and nontoxic strains of Alexandrium minutum. Variation in morphological features between toxic and nontoxic strains was minimal and not significant. Also, variation in 2-DE protein patterns within either toxic or nontoxic strains was low, but pronounced differences were detected between toxic and nontoxic strains. The most notable differences between these strains were several abundant proteins with pIs ranging from 4.8 to 5.3 and apparent molecular masses between 17.5 and 21.5 kDa. Groups of proteins, namely NT1, NT2, NT3, and NT4, were consistently found in all nontoxic strains, while T1 and T2 were prominent in the toxic strains. These specific protein spots characteristic for toxic and nontoxic strains remained clearly distinguishable irrespective of the various growth conditions tested. Therefore, they have the potential to serve as ""taxonomic markers"" to distinguish toxic and nontoxic strains within A. minutum. Initial studies revealed that the expression pattern of T1 was tightly correlated to toxin biosynthesis in the examined alga and may be used to serve as a potential toxin indicator."

BSAR/Fs (BSARs and/or BSAFs) are commonly used to back-calculate sediment preliminary remediation goals (PRGs) from target tissue concentrations; the PRGs are then used to set target action levels (i. e. , sediment concentrations above which remedial actions will be prescribed). The cPAH BSAR/Fs reported across sites and species are highly variable due to both site- and species-specific differences and inconsistent BSAR/F calculation methods and assumptions. We reviewed past studies, identified best practices for developing BSAR/Fs, and compiled publicly available colocated tissue and sediment data for 7 cPAHs from 13 sites across the United States. Of the 249 unique cPAH data sets compiled for various species, only 17 yielded acceptable BSAR/Fs, 16 of which were for clams. The influence of BSAR/Fs on sediment remedial action decisions and costs can be disproportionate to the quality of the statistical models from which they are derived. Therefore, it is important to establish and follow best practices for deriving BSAR/Fs and for deciding whether and how BSAR/Fs should be used. Based on our review and analysis, we highlight the advantages of relying on BSARs and propose a consistent method for deriving and judging the reliability of these relationships.

With the increase of shellfish culture density, phytoplankton in the coastal waters have been excessively consumed in recent years, and the nutrients they depend on are becoming more and more limited, which severely restrict the shellfish mariculture and threaten the coastal ecosystems. In the present study, nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton assemblages and scallop growth status were investigated in the main bay scallop farming waters of the Bohai Sea (Qinhuangdao site) and North Yellow Sea (Zhuanghe site) in 2018. Both phosphate and silicate limitations were observed at the two sites, with the major determinant of phytoplankton assemblages being silicate in Qinhuangdao and phosphate in Zhuanghe, respectively. The phytoplankton assemblages at the two sites displayed different community structures and succession patterns. The phytoplankton community was dominated by dinoflagellates and diatoms in Qinhuangdao, while dinoflagellates were the most abundant group in Zhuanghe, which accounted for 41.9% of the total phytoplankton abundance. The dominant genera of diatoms in Qinhuangdao were Skeletonema, Thalassiosira and Leptocylindrus, while those in Zhuanghe were Thalassiosira and Cyclotella. Greater biomass and more appropriate structure of phytoplankton contributed to higher growth rate and glycogen content of cultured bay scallops. Our study characterized the relationship between nutrient concentration, phytoplankton community and scallop mariculture in the main bay scallop farming waters in northern China. The results suggest that, as nutrient limitation intensified, dinoflagellates are becoming the dominant phytoplankton species in the scallop farming waters of the Bohai Sea and the North Yellow Sea, which is harmful to the coastal mariculture."

Our experiments show that both analogues, AZ-2 and AZ-3, clearly increase cytosolic cAMP levels of human lymphocytes. In calcium studies, we found that only if cells are initially in a calcium-free medium, AZ-2 increases the intracellular calcium concentration with two components: Ca(2+) release from internal stores and Ca(2+) influx from extracellular medium. AZ-2 sensitive Ca(2+) stores seem to be different from the thapsigargin sensitive one. AZ-2-induced Ca(2+) influx is mediated through Ni(2+) and SKF96365 blockable channels, and it is additive with Tg-induced Ca(2+) influx. Surprisingly, AZ-3 does not empty intracellular stores but also increases cytosolic calcium levels. This AZ-3-induced Ca(2+) influx is mediated through Ni(2+) blockable channels, and it is not additive with Tg-induced Ca(2+) influx. In addition, AZ-3 slightly alkalinizes cytosol. In accordance with cAMP studies, we found that adenylyl cyclase (AC) modulation inhibits AZ-2- and AZ-3-evoked Ca(2+) increase and AZ-3-induced pH(i) rise.

Specifically, quantitative and qualitative analysis was conducted using high-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), and accurate identification was carried out by quadrupole orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (Q/E Orbitrap HRMS). The results showed that target analytes demonstrated good linearity within the corresponding range (R2 > 0.995). The limit of detection and limit of quantitation of the proposed method were 0.1 and 0.3 μg/kg, respectively. The average recoveries of analytes were between 70.0% and 120% when spiked at three levels with blank oyster (Crassostrea gigas) as the matrix, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were all less than 12% (n=6).

However, because of the acknowledged harmful cognitive effects of lead even at low levels, lead exposure remains a major public health issue. In France, few biomonitoring data are available for exposure to lead in pregnant women and newborn. The purpose of the perinatal component of the French human biomonitoring (HBM) program was to describe levels of various biomarkers of exposure to several environmental pollutants, including lead, among mother-baby pairs. In this paper, we aimed to describe the distribution of cord blood lead levels (CBLL) in French mother-baby pairs, and to estimate the contribution of the main lead exposure risk factors to these levels. METHOD:A total of 1968 mother-baby pairs selected from the participants of the perinatal component of the French HBM program were included in the study on lead. Lead levels were analyzed in cord blood collected at child delivery by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The data collected included biological sample, socio-demographic characteristics, environmental and occupational exposure, and information on dietary factors. RESULTS:CBLL were quantified for 99.5% of the sample. The CBLL geometric mean was 8.30 μg/l (95% CI [7.94-8.68]) with a 95th percentile of 24.3 μg/l (95% CI [20.7-27.1]). Factors significantly associated with CBLL were tap water consumption, alcohol consumption, shellfish consumption, vegetable consumption, bread consumption, smoking, and the mother being born in countries where lead is often used. CONCLUSION:This study provides the first reference value for CBLL in a random sample of mother-baby pairs not particularly exposed to high levels of lead (24.3 μg/l). A substantial decrease in CBLL over time was observed, which confirms the decrease of exposure to lead among the general population. CBLL observed in this French study were in the range of those found in recent surveys conducted in other countries."

However, collecting organisms to estimate risk is often prohibitively time and resource-intensive. Passive sampling accurately estimates resident organism contamination, and it saves time and resources. This study used low density polyethylene (LDPE) passive water samplers to predict polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) levels in signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus. Resident crayfish were collected at 5 sites within and outside of the Portland Harbor Superfund Megasite (PHSM) in the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon. LDPE deployment was spatially and temporally paired with crayfish collection. Crayfish visceral and tail tissue, as well as water-deployed LDPE, were extracted and analyzed for 62 PAHs using GC-MS/MS. Freely-dissolved concentrations (Cfree) of PAHs in water were calculated from concentrations in LDPE. Carcinogenic risks were estimated for all crayfish tissues, using benzo[a]pyrene equivalent concentrations (BaPeq). ∑PAH were 5-20 times higher in viscera than in tails, and ∑BaPeq were 6-70 times higher in viscera than in tails. Eating only tail tissue of crayfish would therefore significantly reduce carcinogenic risk compared to also eating viscera. Additionally, PAH levels in crayfish were compared to levels in crayfish collected 10 years earlier. PAH levels in crayfish were higher upriver of the PHSM and unchanged within the PHSM after the 10-year period. Finally, a linear regression model predicted levels of 34 PAHs in crayfish viscera with an associated R-squared value of 0.52 (and a correlation coefficient of 0.72), using only the Cfree PAHs in water. On average, the model predicted PAH concentrations in crayfish tissue within a factor of 2.4 ± 1.8 of measured concentrations. This affirms that passive water sampling accurately estimates PAH contamination in crayfish. Furthermore, the strong predictive ability of this simple model suggests that it could be easily adapted to predict contamination in other shellfish of concern."

In order to guarantee consumer protection, the regulatory authorities have defined the maximum level of DSP toxins as 160 µg OA equivalent kg-1 shellfish meat. For risk assessment and overall toxicity determination, knowledge of the relative toxicities of each analogue is required. In absence of enough information from human intoxications, oral toxicity in mice is the most reliable data for establishing Toxicity Equivalence Factors (TEFs). Toxins were administered to mice by gavage, after that the symptomatology and mice mortality was registered over a period of 24 h. Organ damage data were collected at necropsy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used for ultrastructural studies. Toxins in urine, feces and blood were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS. The evaluation of in vitro potencies of OA, DTX1 and DTX2 was performed by the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibition assay. Mice that received DSP toxins by gavage showed diarrhea as the main symptom. Those toxins caused similar gastrointestinal alterations as well as intestine ultrastructural changes. However, DSP toxins did not modify tight junctions to trigger diarrhea. They had different toxicokinetics and toxic potency. The lethal dose 50 (LD50) was 487 µg kg-1 bw for DTX1, 760 µg kg-1 bw for OA and 2262 µg kg-1 bw for DTX2. Therefore, the oral TEF values are: OA = 1, DTX1 = 1.5 and DTX2 = 0.3. This is the first comparative study of DSP toxins performed with accurate well-characterized standards and based on acute toxicity data. Results confirmed that DTX1 is more toxic than OA by oral route while DTX2 is less toxic. Hence, the current TEFs based on intraperitoneal toxicity should be modified. Also, the generally accepted toxic mode of action of this group of toxins needs to be reevaluated."

The Trans Mountain Expansion project would triple the capacity to transport oil through the inlet, threatening TWN's progress to restore shellfish harvesting. To inform ongoing efforts we assessed contamination by heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury) and 48 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) congeners in different shellfish species (Softshell clams, Varnish clams, and Dungeness crab) in three areas. We compared our results against local screening values (SVs) established by the TWN and BC Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, as well as provincial and national benchmarks. In total, we analyzed 18 composite samples of Softshell clams and Varnish clams (5 individuals per sample), as well as 17 individual crabs. We found chemical contamination in all species at all sites. PAHs were most frequently detected in Softshell clams, highest in the site closest to the pipeline terminus. Clams presented higher levels of contamination than crabs for PAHs, but not for heavy metals. For Softshell and Varnish clams, all heavy metals across study sites exceeded at least one of the population-specific SVs. Of the 14 PAHs detected, benzo(a)pyrene presented a median concentration in Softshell clams of 3.25 μ/kg, exceeding local SV for subsistence fisher. Our results call for further assessment of human health impacts related to food harvesting within Burrard Inlet and establishing a long-term coordinated program co-led by the TWN to monitor contamination and inform future harvesting programs. The study draws attention to the need to consider locally-relevant toxicity benchmarks, and include potential health impacts of food contamination in appraising development project proposals."

Closures extended into 2016 and generated an economic shock for coastal fishing communities. This study examines the economic and sociocultural impacts of the Dungeness crab and razor clam fisheries closures on two fishing-dependent communities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 36 community members from two communities impacted by the event - Crescent City, California and Long Beach, Washington. Interviewees included those involved in the fishing, hospitality, and retail industries, local government officials, recreational harvesters, and others. Interviews probed aspects of resilience in economic, social, institutional, and physical domains, based on the contention that community resilience will influence the communities' ability to withstand HAB events. Dimensions of vulnerability were also explored, encompassing sensitivity of the communities to HAB events and their adaptive capacity. Common themes that emerged from the interview responses indicate that economic hardships extended beyond fishing-related operations and permeated through other sectors, particularly the hospitality industry. Significant barriers to accessing financial and employment assistance during extended fisheries closures were identified, particularly for fishers. Long-held traditions surrounding crab and shellfish harvest and consumption were disrupted, threatening the cultural identities of the affected communities. Community members expressed a desire for clearer, more thorough, and more rapid dissemination of information regarding the management of fisheries closures and the health risks associated with HAB toxins. The likelihood of intensifying HABs under climate change heightens the need for actions to increase the resilience of fishing communities to the economic and sociocultural impacts caused by HAB-related fisheries closures."

The concentration data showed that whereas PCB concentrations in sediments were predominantly below the SQG of 20 µg/kg dry weight, large fractions of the PCB concentrations in fish and shellfish species exceeded the tissue residue guideline for the consumption of fish and shellfish by wildlife (i. e. , 50 µg/kg wet weight [ww]) but were below the tissue residue guideline for the consumption of fish and shellfish by human populations (i. e. , 2000 µg/kg ww). Also, PCB concentrations in marine mammals exceeded toxicity reference concentrations. The concentration data were used to develop species- and location-specific Biota-Sediment Accumulation Factors (BSAF = Cbiota /Csediment ), that were used to estimate PCB concentrations in wildlife species that may exist if the PCB concentration in sediments are equal to the SQGs. The results show that if the PCB concentration is equal to the SQGs, then PCB concentrations in most wildlife species can be expected to exceed the tissue residue guideline for the consumption of fish and shellfish by wildlife species and by humans, as well as toxicity reference concentrations for marine mammals. A methodology for developing SQGs for PCBs that are protective of the health of different wildlife species and human consumers of fish and shellfish from general Canadian and coastal First Nations populations was developed and applied. The proposed guidelines may provide useful guidance to establish SQGs for PCBs that can account for the ecological diversity in coastal environments and that better achieve the intent of the guidelines to protect ecosystems. The proposed methodology for guideline development may also be useful in the development of SQGs for other bioaccumulative substances."

Understanding the population dynamics and ecology of this species is thus important for identifying determinants of blooms and associated PSP toxicity. Given reports of extensive genetic heterogeneity in the toxicity and physiology of Alexandrium species, knowledge of genetic population structure in harmful algal species such as A. catenella can also facilitate the understanding of toxic bloom development and ecological adaptation. In this study we employed microsatellite markers to analyze multiple A. catenella strains isolated from several sub-regions in the Gulf of Maine (GoM) during summer blooms, to gain insights into the sources and dynamics of this economically important phytoplankton species. At least three genetically distinct clusters of A. catenella were identified in the GoM. Each cluster contained representatives from different sub-regions, highlighting the extent of connectivity and dispersal throughout the region. This shared diversity could result from cyst beds created by previous coastal blooms, thereby preserving the overall diversity of the regional A. catenella population. Rapid spatiotemporal genetic differentiation of A. catenella populations was observed in local blooms, likely driven by natural selection through environmental conditions such as silicate and nitrate/nitrite concentrations, emphasizing the role of short-term water mass intrusions and biotic processes in determining the diversity and dynamics of marine phytoplankton populations. Given the wide-spread intraspecific diversity of A. catenella in GoM and potentially elsewhere, harmful algal blooms will likely persist in many regions despite global warming and changing environmental conditions in the future. Selection of different genetic lineages through variable hydrological conditions might impact toxin production and profiles of future blooms, challenging HAB control and prediction of PSP risk in the future."

Ethical and technical reasons have prompted the search for new detection procedures as an alternative to the mouse bioassay. On the basis of the detection of molecular interactions by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors, an inhibition assay was developed using an anti-GTX2/3 antibody (GT13-A) and a saxitoxin-CM5 chip. This assay allowed for quantification of saxitoxin (STX), decarbamoyl saxitoxin (dcSTX), gonyautoxin 2,3 (GTX2/3), decarbamoyl gonyautoxin 2,3 (dcGTX2/3), gonyautoxin 5 (GTX5), and C 1,2 (C1/2) at concentrations from 2 to 50 ng/mL. The interference of five shellfish matrixes with the inhibition assay was analyzed. Mussels, clams, cockles, scallops, and oysters were extracted with five published methods. Ethanol extracts and acetic acid/heat extracts (AOAC Lawrence method) performed adequately in terms of surface regeneration and baseline interference, did not inhibit antibody binding to the chip surface significantly, and presented STX calibration curves similar to buffer controls in all matrixes tested. Hydrochloric acid/heat extracts (AOAC mouse bioassay method) presented surface regeneration problems, and although ethanol-acetic acid/dichloromethane extracts performed well, they were considered too laborious for routine sample testing. Overall the best results were obtained with the ethanol extraction method with calibration curves prepared in blank matrix extracts. STX recovery rate with the ethanol extraction method was 60.52+/-3.72%, with variations among species. The performance of this biosensor assay in natural samples, compared to two AOAC methods for PSP toxin quantification (mouse bioassay and HPLC), suggests that this technology can be useful as a PSP screening assay. In summary, the GT13-A-STX chip inhibition assay is capable of PSP toxin detection in ethanol shellfish extracts, with sufficient sensitivity to quantify the toxin in the range of the European regulatory limit of 80 microg/100 g of shellfish meat."

Such toxins and the algae producing them are regularly surveyed in many countries, including Europe, North America, Japan and others. However, very little is known regards the occurrence of such algae and their toxins in most African countries. This paper reports on a survey of phytoplankton and algal toxins in Nigerian coastal waters. Seawater samples were obtained from four sites for phytoplankton identification, on three occasions between the middle of October 2014 and the end of February 2015 (Bar Beach and Lekki in Lagos State, Port Harcourt in Rivers State and Uyo in Akwa Ibom State). The phytoplankton community was generally dominated by diatoms and cyanobacteria; however several species of dinoflagellates were also identified: Dinophysis caudata, Lingulodinium polyedrum and two benthic species of Prorocentrum. Passive samplers (containing Diaion(®) HP-20 resin) were deployed for several 1-week periods on the same four sites to obtain profiles of algal toxins present in the seawater. Quantifiable amounts of okadaic acid (OA) and pectenotoxin 2 (PTX2), as well as traces of dinophysistoxin 1 (DTX1) were detected at several sites. Highest concentrations (60 ng OA g(-1) HP-20 resin) were found at Lekki and Bar Beach stations, which also had the highest salinities. Non-targeted analysis using full-scan high resolution mass spectrometry showed that algal metabolites differed from site to site and for different sampling occasions. Screening against a marine natural products database indicated the potential presence of cyanobacterial compounds in the water column, which was also consistent with phytoplankton analysis. During this study, the occurrence of the marine dinoflagellate toxins OA and PTX2 has been demonstrated in coastal waters of Nigeria, despite unfavourable environmental conditions, with regards to the low salinities measured. Hence shellfish samples should be monitored in future to assess the risk for public health through accumulation of such toxins in seafood."

In this study, the effects of nutrient loading on the fate of Hg in shallow coastal estuaries were examined to evaluate if their interaction enhances or reduces Hg bioavailability in sediments, the water column, and concentrations in lower trophic level fish (Fundulus heteroclitus and Menidia menidia). Multiple sites were sampled within two human impacted coastal lagoons, Great South Bay (GSB) and Jamaica Bay (JB), on the southern coast of Long Island, NY, United States of America (U. S. A. ). Carbon (C), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), Hg, and methylmercury (MeHg) were measured in surface sediments and the water column, and total Hg (THg) was measured in two species of forage fish. Minimal differences were found in dissolved and particulate Hg, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and salinity between the two bays. Across lagoons, concentrations of chlorophyll-a were correlated with total suspended solids (TSS), and water column THg and MeHg was largely associated with the particulate fraction. Methylmercury concentrations in particulates decreased with increasing TSS and chlorophyll-a, evidence of biomass dilution of MeHg with increasing productivity at the base of the food chain. Water column Hg was associated with THg concentrations in Atlantic silversides, while mummichog THg concentrations were related to sediment concentrations, reflecting their different feeding strategies. Finally, higher nutrient loading (lower C:N in sediments) while related to lower particulate concentrations coincided with higher bioaccumulation factors (BAF) for Hg in both fish species. Thus, in shallow coastal lagoons, increased nutrient loading resulted in decreased Hg concentrations at the base of the food web but resulted in greater bioaccumulation of Hg to fish relative to its availability in algal food."

}</s>","The need for reference materials for quality control of analysis of foodstuffs has been stressed frequently. This has been particularly true in the phycotoxins field, where there is a great shortage of both pure calibration standards and reference materials. Worldwide there are very few independent bodies that produce certified reference materials for phycotoxins, the main producers currently being the National Research Council Canada and the Japanese Food Research Laboratory. Limited availability of contaminated shellfish and algae, as well as the time and knowledge necessary for the production of adequate reference materials, continuously lead to limited editions of certified reference materials and even more limited production of in-house reference materials. The restricted availability of in-house quality control materials promotes the rapid use of the limited certified reference materials, which in turn hampers the production of the suite of materials required globally for complete protection of public health. This paper outlines the various options that analysts can pursue in the use of reference materials for internal and external quality control, with a view to optimising the efforts of both reference materials users and reference materials producers. For this purpose, the logical sequence is reviewed from the discovery of a new bioactive compound in shellfish, through initial method development up to regulation for food safety purposes including accepted reference methods. Subsequently, the requirements for and efforts typically spent in the production and characterisation of laboratory reference materials, certified reference materials and other test materials used in inter-laboratory studies or proficiency testing, in the area of marine biotoxins are evaluated. Particular emphasis is put on practical advice for the preparation of in-house reference materials. The intricate link between reference material characterisation and method performance is outlined to give guidance on the appropriate in-house method validation in the rapidly developing field of phycotoxins."

The seawater temperature was determined concomitantly. In Kure Bay, maximum concentrations of 1,400 and 1,300 cells/mL at 0 and 5 m depths were observed on 21 and 24 April 1997. In Kaita Bay, remarkably high concentrations above 1,000 cells/mL of A. tamarense were observed in two out of three years investigated. These facts suggest that the environment in both bays is favorable for the propagation of A. tamarense. The temperature range at which the natural population of A. tamarense blooms was generally from 12 to 16 degrees C. Four strains (ATKR-94, -95, -97 and -01) from Kure Bay and one strain (ATKT-97) from Kaita Bay were established. The strain ATKR-94, cultured in modified SW-2 medium at 15 degrees C for 15 days, showed a specific toxicity of 33.8 x 10(-6) MU/cell. The toxins in all five strains exist almost exclusively as beta-epimers (C2 (PX2 or GTX8), GTX3, dcGTX3 and GTX4), which accounted for 54.9 to 73.0 mol% of the total. The corresponding a-epimers (C1 (PX1 or epi-GTX8), GTX2, dcGTX2 and GTX1) accounted for 6.0 to 28.9 mol%. The toxin profiles of ATKR-97 and ATKT-97 were characterized by unusually high proportions of low-potency sulfocarbamoyl toxin, which comprised 62.4 and 68.2 mol%, respectively, of total toxins. In the toxic bivalves, the low-toxicity sulfocarbamoyl components, major components of A. tamarense, were present in amounts of only a few percent, suggesting that in vivo conversion of PSP occurs after ingestion. A comparison of the toxin profiles of the causative dinoflagellate and contaminated bivalves showed that PSP components exist in the bivalves in the form of alpha-epimers, presumably owing to accumulation or storage of the toxins."

In bivalves, free forms of DSTs can be esterified with fatty acids at the C-7 site to form acyl esters (DTX3), presumably a detoxification mechanism for bivalves. However, the effects of esterification of DSTs on fatty acid metabolism in mollusks remain poorly understood. In this study, mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were fed the DST-producing dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima for 10 days followed by an additional 10-days depuration in filtered seawater to track the variation in quantity and composition of DST acyl esters and fatty acids. A variety of esters of okadaic acid (OA) and dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1) were mainly formed in the digestive gland (DG), although trace amounts of esters also appeared in muscle tissue. A large relative amount of OA (60%-84%) and DTX1 (80%-92%) was esterified to DTX3 in the visceral mass (referred to as digestive gland, DG), and the major ester acyl chains were C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1, C20:1 and C20:2. The DG and muscle tissues showed pronounced differences in fatty acid content and composition during both feeding and depuration periods. In the DG, fatty acid content gradually decreased in parallel with increasing accumulation and esterification of DSTs. The decline in fatty acids was accelerated during depuration without food. This reduction in the content of important polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), would lead to a reduction in the nutritional value of mussels. Enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, including acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL), were actively involved in the metabolism of fatty acids in the DG, whereas their activities were weak in muscle tissue during the feeding period. This study helps to improve the understanding of interactions between the esterification of DSTs and fatty acid dynamics in bivalve mollusks."

The consumption of seafood contaminated with DA is associated with gastrointestinal illness that, in the case of high DA exposure, can evolve into a spectrum of responses ranging from agitation to hallucinations, memory loss, seizures and coma. Because algal blooms that produce DA are becoming more widespread and very little is known about the dangers of chronic, low-dose exposure, we initiated a preclinical study focused on the reproductive and developmental effects of DA in a nonhuman primate model. To this end, 32 adult female Macaca fascicularis monkeys were orally exposed to 0, 0.075 or 0.15 mg/kg/day DA on a daily basis, prior to and during pregnancy. Females were bred to non-exposed males and infants were evaluated at birth. Results from this study provided no evidence of changes in DA plasma concentrations with chronic exposure. DA exposure was not associated with reproductive toxicity or adverse changes in the physical characteristics of newborns. However, in an unanticipated finding, our clinical observations battery revealed the presence of subtle neurological effects in the form of intentional tremors in the exposed adult females. While females in both dose groups displayed increased tremoring, the effect was dose-dependent and observed at a higher frequency in females exposed to 0.15 mg/kg/day. These results demonstrate that chronic, low-level exposure to DA is associated with injury to the adult CNS and suggest that current regulatory guidelines designed to protect human health may not be adequate for high-frequency shellfish consumers. 1) Domoic acid acts as a tremoragen after chronic, low-dose oral exposure in adults. 2) Exposure across pregnancy does not result in maternal reproductive toxicity. 3) In-utero exposure does not adversely impact physical characteristics of exposed newborns. 4) Current regulatory guidelines may not adequately protect high-frequency shellfish consumers from DA-induced neurological injury."

It is also a source of non-essential trace elements (Ag, Cd, Hg, Pb) that can be deleterious for health even at low concentrations. Edible parts of sixteen species (fish, cephalopods, crustaceans and bivalves) of great importance in the Pertuis Charentais region, one of the main shellfish farming and fishing areas along the french coastline, were sampled in winter and analyzed to determine their fatty acid (FA) composition and trace element concentrations. Based on these analyses, a suite of indices was calculated to estimate risk and benefit of seafood consumption: the n-6/n-3 ratio, the atherogenic index, the thrombogenic index, the EPA + DHA daily recommended portion, as well as the maximum safe consumption. The results showed that fish contributed the most to LC n-3 PUFA supply, while bivalves and crustaceans were more beneficial in essential trace elements. Whatever the species, the concentrations of non-essential elements were not limiting for seafood consumption, as important amounts of the analyzed species can be eaten daily or weekly before becoming hazardous to consumers. Yet, concentrations of Hg in dogfish and seabass can become a concern for frequent seafood consumers (>three meals a week), confirming that varying seafood items is a key point for consumers to optimize the benefits of diverse seafood resources. Considering FA composition, whiting and pilchard are the most beneficial fish species for human diet, while surmullet was the least beneficial one. However, using an index integrating the relative risk due to Hg content, the surmullet appears as one of the most beneficial. This study provides a temporal shot of the quality of marine resources consumed in winter period in the studied area and highlights the complexity of a quantitative risk and benefit assessment with respect to the biochemical attributes of selected seafood."

In this work, we assess Cu isotopes in Pacific oysters (C. gigas) as a new tool for monitoring anthropogenic Cu bioaccumulation into marine environments. Arcachon Bay was taken as a natural laboratory due to its increasing contamination by Cu, and its relevance as a prominent shellfish production area. Here, we transplanted 18-month old oysters reared in an oceanic neighbor area into two Arcachon Bay mariculture sites under different exposure levels to continental Cu inputs. At the end of their 12-month long transplantation period, the oysters' Cu body burdens had increased, and was shifted toward more positive δ65Cu values. The gradient of Cu isotope compositions observed for oysters sampling stations was consistent with relative geographic distance and exposure intensities to unknown continental Cu sources. A binary isotope mixing model based on experimental data allowed to estimate the Cu continental fraction bioaccumulated in the transplanted oysters. The positive δ65Cu values and high bioaccumulated levels of Cu in transplanted oysters support that continental emissions are dominantly anthropogenic. However, identifying specific pollutant coastal source remained unelucidated mostly due to their broader and overlapping isotope signatures and potential post-depositional Cu isotope fractionation processes. Further investigations on isotope fractionation of Cu-based compounds in an aqueous medium may improve Cu source discrimination. Thus, using Cu as an example, this work combines for the first time a well-known caged bivalve approach with metal stable isotope techniques for monitoring and quantifying the bioaccumulation of anthropogenic metal into marine environments. Also, it states the main challenges to pinpoint specific coastal anthropogenic sources utilizing this approach and provides the perspectives for further studies to overcome them."

In this study, we first evaluated contamination by PFASs in a total of 230 samples of marine shellfish from the Bohai Sea. Samples included five important shellfish species, collected from important aquaculture spots distributed around the Bohai Sea. Samples were analyzed by an ultra-fast liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method, which could simultaneously detect 23 PFASs in shellfish. Our research verified that PFASs have become a threat to the safety of shellfish products in this area. Furthermore, contamination by PFASs in shellfish changed depending on the components of PFASs, the species of shellfish, and the sampling sites. Many of the 23 target compounds contributed to the high detection ratio (>50%) as follows: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) > perfluorononanoic acid > perfluorodecanesulfonic acid > perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Compared with other dominant components, PFOA not only had the highest detection percentage in shellfish samples (98.3%), but its detection level contributed to 87.2% of total PFASs concentrations, indicating that PFOA is the major threat to the safety of shellfish products. The highest level of PFAS was found in clams (62.5 ng g-1 wet weight of PFOA). The concentration of total PFAS in different shellfish species showed the following trend: clams > mussels > scallops > whelks > oysters. The maximum concentration of total PFAS or PFOA was found in Shouguang. The total concentration of PFOS and its precursor were highest in Cangzhou, possibly due to local industrial activities. The results presented in this paper provide new data on the contamination of marine shellfish along the Bohai Sea coasts in China, and constitute a reference for future monitoring of contamination by emerging contaminants in Bohai coast."

The growing international trade in seafood species and products has added to the popularity and frequency of consumption of a variety of seafood products across many countries. This increased production and consumption of seafood has been accompanied by more frequent reports of adverse health problems among consumers as well as processors of seafood. Adverse reactions to seafood are often generated by contaminants but can also be mediated by the immune system and cause allergies. These reactions can result from exposure to the seafood itself or various non-seafood components in the product. Non-immunological reactions to seafood can be triggered by contaminants such as parasites, bacteria, viruses, marine toxins and biogenic amines. Ingredients added during processing and canning of seafood can also cause adverse reactions. Importantly all these substances are able to trigger symptoms which are similar to true allergic reactions, which are mediated by antibodies produced by the immune system against specific allergens. Allergic reactions to 'shellfish', which comprises the groups of crustaceans and molluscs, can generate clinical symptoms ranging from mild urticaria and oral allergy syndrome to life-threatening anaphylactic reactions. The prevalence of crustacean allergy seems to vary largely between geographical locations, most probably as a result of the availability of seafood. The major shellfish allergen is tropomyosin, although other allergens may play an important part in allergenicity such as arginine kinase and myosin light chain. Current observations regard tropomyosin to be the major allergen responsible for molecular and clinical cross-reactivity between crustaceans and molluscs, but also to other inhaled invertebrates such as house dust mites and insects. Future research on the molecular structure of tropomyosins with a focus on the immunological and particularly clinical cross-reactivity will improve diagnosis and management of this potentially life-threatening allergy and is essential for future immunotherapy."

As many as 50000 cases worldwide are reported annually, and the condition is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Basin, Indian Ocean and Caribbean. Isolated outbreaks occur sporadically but with increasing frequency in temperate areas such as Europe and North America. Increase in travel between temperate countries and endemic areas and importation of susceptible fish has led to its encroachment into regions of the world where ciguatera has previously been rarely encountered. In the developed world, ciguatera poses a public health threat due to delayed or missed diagnosis. Ciguatera is frequently encountered in Australia. Sporadic cases are often misdiagnosed or not medically attended to, leading to persistent or recurrent debilitating symptoms lasting months to years. Without treatment, distinctive neurologic symptoms persist, occasionally being mistaken for multiple sclerosis. Constitutional symptoms may be misdiagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome. A common source outbreak is easier to recognize and therefore notify to public health organizations. We present a case series of four adult tourists who developed ciguatera poisoning after consuming contaminated fish in Vanuatu. All responded well to intravenous mannitol. This is in contrast to a fifth patient who developed symptoms suggestive of ciguatoxicity in the same week as the index cases but actually had staphylococcal endocarditis with bacteraemia. In addition to a lack of response to mannitol, clinical and laboratory indices of sepsis were present in this patient. Apart from ciguatera, acute gastroenteritis followed by neurological symptoms may be due to paralytic or neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, scombroid and pufferfish toxicity, botulism, enterovirus 71, toxidromes and bacteraemia. Clinical aspects of ciguatera toxicity, its pathophysiology, diagnostic difficulties and epidemiology are discussed."

The global population is expected to reach 9.6 billion people by 2050 where there will be increased demand for shellfish and for sustained improvements in harvesting. The production of most consumed species of shellfish is sea-based and are thus susceptible to in situ environmental conditions and water quality. Population growth has contributed to expansion of urbanization and the generation of effluent and waste that reaches aquatic environments, potentially contaminating seafood by exposure to non-treated effluents or inappropriately discarded waste. Environmental contaminants as microplastics (MP), pharmaceuticals (PHAR) and potentially toxic contaminants (PTE) are being identified in all trophic levels and are a current threat to both shellfish and consumer safety. Immunotoxicity, genotoxicity, fertility reduction, mortality and bioaccumulation of PTE are representative examples of the variety of effects already established in contaminated shellfish. In humans, the consumption of contaminated shellfish can lead to neurological and developmental effects, reproductive and gastrointestinal disorders and in extreme cases, death. This timely review provides insights into the presence of MP, PHAR and PTE in shellfish, and estimate the daily intake and hazard quotient for consumption behaviours. Alternatives approaches for seafood depuration that encompass risk reduction are addressed, to reflect state of the art knowledge from a Republic of Ireland perspective. Review of best-published literature revealed that MP, PHAR and PTE contaminants were detected in commercialised species of shellfish, such as Crassostrea and Mytilus. The ability to accumulate these contaminants by shellfish due to feeding characteristics is attested by extensive in vitro studies. However, there is lack of knowledge surrounding the distribution of these contaminants in the aquatic environment their interactions with humans. Preventive approaches including risk assessment are necessary to safeguard the shellfish industry and the consumer."

To minimise the public health risks associated with shellfish consumption, determining the presence of faecal contamination in shellfish and their growing waters is crucial. In this study, we evaluated the use of pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) as an indicator of human faecal contamination in oysters, mussels, cockles and shellfish growing waters in New Zealand. Using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) the presence, and where applicable, the concentration of PMMoV was determined in faeces from 11 different animal species, influent (untreated) wastewater, shellfish and shellfish growing waters. Non-human faecal samples (from seagull, Canada goose, black swan and dog) were RT-qPCR positive for PMMoV. The faecal source specificity of PMMoV was 0.83 (maximum value of 1) when 'detected but not quantifiable' (DNQ) values were used. However, when 'lower limit of quantification' (LLOQ) values were used, the specificity increased to 0.92. The PMMoV concentration in influent wastewater (n = 10) ranged from 6.3 to 7.7 log10 genome copies (GC)/L with a mean (±standard deviation) of 7.1 ± 0.5 log10 GC/L. The overall occurrence of PMMoV in shellfish and shellfish growing waters from four different areas was 46/51 (90%) and 29/52 (56%), respectively. Of the cockles collected from an area known to be impacted by effluent wastewater, 14/14 (100%) contained PMMoV concentrations above the LLOQ. In contrast, only 13/37 (35%) shellfish and 6/52 (11.5%) growing water samples collected from three areas with low anthropogenic impact contained PMMoV concentrations above the LLOQ. The high concentration of PMMoV in influent wastewater indicates that PMMoV may be a promising indicator of human faecal contamination. The presence of PMMoV in shellfish and growing waters with a low anthropogenic impact may be of avian origin, and this needs to be considered if using PMMoV for monitoring shellfish and shellfish growing water quality in New Zealand."

Seafood-related behavior is often an outcome of assessing attributes of the product (e. g. , taste, freshness, source). To shift consumer (i. e. , tourists and residents) preferences toward environmentally sustainable products, many coastal communities of the United States (U. S. ) promote production (i. e. , Wild-caught, Environmentally sustainable) and source (i. e. , Harvested locally, Safe from pollutants) attributes of local seafood. Even if consumers believe these production and source attributes are important, they may lack confidence in their ability to distinguish them when purchasing seafood. Expansion of sustainable coastal mariculture is recommended for food security and enhancing economic resilience of local commercial fisheries, but this newer production attribute (i. e. , Farmed in marine waters) adds more complexity to consumer decision-making. Research examining the difference between importance and confidence for seafood attributes is limited. This study surveyed tourists and residents in South Carolina and Florida (U. S. ) coastal communities where varying levels of tourism and commercial seafood harvest, including marine farming of shellfish, were occurring. The research measured these consumers' level of importance and confidence for production and source attributes when purchasing seafood in the coastal community. Residents rated importance and confidence higher than tourists for some attributes, but there was no difference between states for tourist or resident subgroups. Both tourists and residents rated confidence lower than importance for all attributes. An Importance-Confidence Analysis (ICA), adapted from Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA), identified attributes needing enhanced marketing and consumer education. The ICA indicated that Environmentally sustainable and Safe from pollutants were high priorities for improving confidence. The low priority rating for Farmed in marine waters was deemed misleading because improved outreach for this attribute could reduce barriers to acceptance and improve recognition."

With increased population pressure and depleted groundwater reserves, surface water is becoming more used as a raw water source, both from rivers and lakes/reservoirs. Additional nutrients in water which arise from sewage discharge, agricultural run-off or storm water result in overabundance of cyanobacteria, described as a 'water bloom'. The majority of cyanobacterial water-blooms are of toxic species, producing a diversity of toxins. The most important toxins presenting a risk to the human population are the neurotoxic alkaloids (anatoxins and paralytic shellfish poisons), the cyclic peptide hepatotoxins (microcystins) and the cytotoxic alkaloids (cylindrospermopsins). At the present time the only cyanobacteral toxin family that have been internationally assessed for health risk by the WHO are the microcystins, which cause acute liver injury and are active tumour promoters. Based on sub-chronic studies in rodents and pigs, a provisional Guideline Level for drinking water of 1 microg/L of microcystin-LR has been determined. This has been adopted in legislation in countries in Europe, South America and Australasia. This may be revised in the light of future teratogenicity, reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. The other cyanobacterial toxin which has been proposed for detailed health risk assessment is cylindrospermopsin, a cytotoxic compound which has marked genotoxicity, probable mutagenicity, and is a potential carcinogen. This toxin has caused human poisoning from drinking water, and occurs in water supplies in the USA, Europe, Asia, Australia and South America. An initial health risk assessment is presented with a proposed drinking water Guideline Level of 1 microg/L.

The total lipophilic shellfish toxin (LST) levels in bivalves showed geographical and annual variations. LSTs were detected mostly in the hepatopancreas of mussels from Jinhae Bay throughout the entire year, except in November and December of 2007, but were almost undetectable in all samples during the entire year in 2009. The peak DSP toxin (okadaic acid plus dinophysistoxin 1) levels in the hepatopancreas of mussels from Jinhae Bay and the Tongyeong region were 945.3 and 37.6 ng/g, respectively. The DSP toxin content was about 10 times higher in mussels than in oysters collected from the same region. The major toxins in bivalves were okadaic acid and dinophysistoxin 1; however, pectenotoxin 2 or yessotoxin was occasionally detected as a major component. The results of a quantitative analysis of phytoplankton showed that Dinophysis acuminata was the most probable source of the LSTs, with the exception of yessotoxin. When the highest DSP toxin level was measured (945.3 ng/g in the hepatopancreas of mussels from Jinhae Bay), the toxin concentration in whole mussel tissue was calculated to be 114.0 ng/g. The calculated highest DSP toxin level in whole oyster tissue from both regions was 15.0 ng/g. The calculated maximum toxicities in whole mussel and oyster tissues were lower than the regulatory limit (160 to 200 ng/g) in Korea, the European Union, and the United States. Korean oysters (242 samples) and mussels (214 samples) were thus deemed safe for consumption. But because such variation was detected in a relatively small area of the coast, it is possible that at some locations or during a specific period LST levels could exceed the standard and a few consumers could be at risk of experiencing DSP."

Outbreaks are well recognised throughout most regions of the world, but with the highest levels of toxicity to date recorded in mussels from Argentina. Whilst toxicity has been documented for selected outbreaks over the years, testing has been conducted using a mouse bioassay. Consequently there is a need to establish baseline data utilising modern chemical detection methods, which also facilitate the quantification of individual toxin analogues, giving useful data on toxin profiles as well as total sample toxicity. In this study, 151 shellfish samples harvested from the marine waters of Argentina between 1980 and 2012 were subjected to analysis by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection, since Jan 2019 the European Union reference method for PSP determination. Total PST concentrations were found to vary enormously throughout the coastline of Argentina, with higher levels of toxins found in the central regions of Rio Negro and Chubut. Toxin profiles in terms of molar percentage of total concentrations were dominated by the gonyautoxins GTX1&4 and GTX2&3, followed by C1&2, STX and dcGTX2&3, with minor levels of other analogues previously not reported in the country. Profiles were found to vary significantly, with statistical clusters of profile types associated with a wide range of factors, including species, spatial and temporal differences, as well as likely source microalgae species and potential toxin transformation pathways. Overall application of the chemical detection method has confirmed both the significant risk to shellfish consumers in Argentina with periodic outbreaks of extremely high toxin levels and a large variability in toxin profiles relating in part to previously reported variabilities in microalgal toxin content. The study has demonstrated the potential for the method to systematically study the relationships between toxicity, toxin profile, source phytoplankton and other environmental factors."

The results showed a wide diffusion of viral contamination in the shellfish production areas considered. HAV prevalence was low (0.9%) with contamination levels that varied from 5 to 7 × 10(2)copies/g. On the contrary, NoV showed a high prevalence (51.5%), with a large variability according to the group considered (e. g. 47.8% for Crassostrea in Veneto, 79.7% for Mytilus in Campania, 84.6% for Tapes in Sardinia).

Eight‐hundred and twenty oyster, mussel, cockle, and clam samples were collected and cultured. Clostridium difficile isolates were subjected to polymerase chain reaction disk diffusion. Twenty‐six out of 820 (3.17%) shellfish samples were positive for C. difficile. Mussel (5.00%) and oyster (4.00%) were the most commonly contaminated samples. Clostridium difficile strains exhibited the highest prevalence of resistance against ampicillin (92.30%), penicillin (84.61%), amoxicillin (76.92%), moxifloxacin (65.38%), and metronidazole (57.69%). Prevalence of resistance against more than eight types of antibiotics was 15.38%. TcdA (50%), tcdB (30.76%), and cdtA (30.76%) were the most commonly detected toxigenic genes.

Shellfish samples have been considered as a potential source of toxigenic multidrug resistant C. difficile. Simultaneous presence of multiple toxigenic genes in the multidrug resistant C. difficile strains poses an important public health issue regarding the consumption of raw and shellfish. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Due to the high‐consumption rate of molluscan shellfish, they should have a high microbial quality. Clostridium difficile is common foodborne bacteria with an emergence of antibiotic resistance and toxin production. The current research is the first report of the isolation and study the antibiotic resistance and toxigenic gene profile of the C. difficile strains isolated from oyster, mussel, cockle, and clam samples caught from the Persian Gulf, Iran.

Toxic dinoflagellates of the genus Alexandrium are known to produce paralytic shellfish toxins and to release bioactive extracellular compounds (BECs) with potent cytotoxic, hemolytic, ichtyotoxic and allelopathic activity. Negative allelochemical interactions refer to the chemicals that are released by the genus Alexandrium and that induce adverse effects on the physiology of co-occurring protists and predators. Releasing BECs gives the donor a competitive advantage that may help to form dense toxic blooms of phytoplankton. However BECs released by Alexandrium minutum are uncharacterized and it is impossible to quantify them using classical chemical methods. Allelochemical interactions are usually quantified through population growth inhibition or lytic-activity based bioassays using a secondary target organism. However these bioassays require time (for growth or microalgal counts) and/or are based on lethal effects. The use of pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometry has been widely used to assess the impact of environmental stressors on phytoplankton but rarely for allelochemical interactions. Here we evaluated the use of PAM and propose a rapid chlorophyll fluorescence based bioassay to quantify allelochemical BECs released from Alexandrium minutum. We used the ubiquitous diatom Chaetoceros muelleri as a target species. The bioassay, based on sub-lethal effects, quantifies allelochemical activity from different samples (filtrates, extracts in seawater) within a short period of time (2 h). This rapid bioassay will help investigate the role of allelochemical interactions in Alexandrium bloom establishment. It will also further our understanding of the potential relationship between allelochemical activities and other cytotoxic activities from BECs. While this bioassay was developed for the species A. minutum, it may be applicable to other species producing allelochemicals and may provide further insights into the role and impact of allelochemical interactions in forming dense algal blooms and structuring marine ecosystems."

Eleven different contaminants/contaminant groups and allergens have been selected for detailed discussion in this paper. They occur in foods as a result of: use as a food additive or ingredient; processing-induced reactions; food packaging migration; deliberate adulteration; and/or presence as a chemical contaminant or natural toxin in the environment. Examples include acrylamide as a food-processing-induced contaminant, bisphenol A as a food packaging-derived chemical, melamine and related compounds as food adulterants and persistent organic pollutants, and perchlorate as an environmental contaminant. Ochratoxin A, fumonisins, and paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins are examples of naturally occurring toxins whereas sulfites, peanuts, and milk exemplify common allergenic food additives/ingredients. To deal with the increasing number of sample matrices and analytes of interest, two analytical approaches have become increasingly prevalent. The first has been the development of rapid screening methods for a variety of analytes based on immunochemical techniques, utilizing ELISA or surface plasmon resonance technology. The second is the development of highly sophisticated multi-analyte methods based on liquid chromatography coupled with multiple-stage mass spectrometry for identification and simultaneous quantification of a wide range of contaminants, often with much less requirement for tedious cleanup procedures. Whereas rapid screening methods enable testing of large numbers of samples, the multi analyte mass spectrometric methods enable full quantification with confirmation of the analytes of interest. Both approaches are useful when gathering surveillance data to determine occurrence and background levels of both recognized and newly identified contaminants in foods in order to estimate human daily intake for health risk assessment."

Results revealed significant levels of PCBs, DDTs and lindane in mangrove sediments ranging from 0.3 to 19.1, 0.3 to 15.9, and 0.1 to 1.9 ng g(-1) d. w. , respectively.

POP levels and patterns were in good accordance with literature data available for other tropical developing countries. A seasonal quantitative difference was highlighted with higher levels of PCBs and DDTs in sediments after the wet season, likely due to the strong wash-out of residues from inland to the marine ecosystems during the rainy season. The observed pattern of DDT and its metabolites pointed out probable recent applications of DDT for public health emergencies in Senegal. Exploited molluscs were exposed to the same POP compounds as those measured in sediments. They presented OCP levels within the same range as in sediments, while significant higher concentrations of PCBs were observed in shellfish soft tissues revealing a higher bioaccumulation potential mainly due to the lipophilicity of these compounds. Finally, the influence of the reproduction cycle on POP levels through lipid content variations was highlighted, minimizing potential differences in POP bioaccumulation between shellfish species. From an ecotoxicological and public health point of view, results from this study revealed that POPs in sediments from the Petite Côte and the Sine-Saloum Estuary would not cause toxic effects and impairments in molluscs from these regions, and that no potential risk exists for human, especially local populations, through mangrove shellfish consumption."

The European Union provides comprehensive regulations covering various general food safety aspects to manage the risk of contamination in shellfish farms. Many analytical methods have been proposed to evaluate algal toxins presence in the environment and in food products, for conducting surveillance studies of the main molluscs production sites and, where necessary, immediate monitoring of possible contamination of shellfish. In this work, a one-year analytical surveillance study was carried out to verify the possible presence of algal biotoxins in molluscs from a Mediterranean breeding area. Water and molluscs were sampled from a district of the North-East coast of Sicily, consisting of a unique brackish ecosystem of two lakes connected to each other and to the sea by narrow canals. Water samples were collected to investigate phytoplankton i by microscope analysis to assess the presence of potentially toxin-producing species, such as Pseudo-nitzschia spp, Alexandrium spp and Gonyaulax spinifera, although the presence of toxic phytoplankton has never reached alert levels. Mussels and clams samples were submitted to analysis of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins, amnesic shellfish poisoning toxins and lipophilic toxins by liquid chromatography-based methods Only a few yessotoxins were detected, having concentrations always below the regulation limits. An existing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based multiresidue method for lipophilic biotoxins was adopted and extended to cover emerging biotoxins such as cyclic imines. The performance of the analytical method for Gymnodimine A and Spirolide 13-desMeC was assessed, obtaining respective quantitation limits of 20 and 10 µg kg-1, a precision always lower than 13% and trueness in the 81-120% range.

However, very little is known about the uptake kinetics of these toxins and the environmental factors that may modify this process. We have studied the effect of mussel size, temperature, seston volume, food quality, and volume-specific toxin concentration (VOSTOC), on the uptake rate of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins by mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), by means of a second order factorial experiment. Over a 3-day period, the mussels were fed artificial diets containing Alexandrium minutum AL1V (a PSP toxin producer), Tetraselmis suecica, Ensiculifera sp1 and silt, to the levels required by each treatment. Mussel size, seston volume and VOSTOC were found to be statistically significant when the total toxin accumulated per weight of wet tissue was considered. Mussel size affected the uptake negatively and latter two positively. The interactions, mussel size-VOSTOC and mussel size-food quality were also significant. The response was not linear as shown by the significance of the quadratic term of mussel size. Notwithstanding, when the PSP toxins accumulation per mussel was analysed, only one factor, the VOSTOC and the interactions, food quality-mussel size and food quality-seston volume, were found to be significant. VOSTOC was the most important factor in the accumulation of toxins, in our opinion, probably due to toxin assimilation being mainly regulated by the probability of contact between the toxins and the cellular walls of the digestive system. The size of the bivalve is also especially important because toxin concentration is usually calculated per weight of bivalve tissue and because the weight-specific ingestion increases with mussel size. The food quality, which was directly related to the assimilation of organic matter, had an inverse effect on toxin assimilation. In our opinion, this is probably due to the effect of inorganic particles in enhancing the disruption of Alexandrium cells. Temperature had no effect on the uptake rate except for the accumulation of the gonyautoxin GTX1."

These toxins severely endanger environmental safety and human health due to the production of paralytic shellfish poisons (PSPs). Although the molecular mechanisms of aphantoxin neurotoxicity have been studied, many questions remain to be resolved such as in vivo alterations in branchial histology and neurotransmitter inactivation induced by these neurotoxins. Aphantoxins extracted from a naturally isolated strain of A. flos-aquae DC-1 were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The basic components of the isolated aphantoxins identified were gonyautoxin 1 (GTX1), gonyautoxin 5 (GTX5), and neosaxitoxin (neoSTX), which comprised 34.04, 21.28, and 12.77% of the total, respectively. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) was administrated 5.3 or 7.61mg STX equivalents (eq)/kg (low and high doses, respectively) of the A. flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins by intraperitoneal injection. Histological alterations and changes in neurotransmitter inactivation in the gills of zebrafish were investigated for 24h following exposure. Aphantoxin exposure significantly increased the activities of gill alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and resulted in histological alterations in the gills during the first 12h of exposure, indicating the induction of functional and structural damage. Gill acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activities were inhibited significantly, suggesting an alteration of neurotransmitter inactivation in zebrafish gills. The observed alterations in gill structure and function followed a time- and dose-dependent pattern. The results demonstrate that aphantoxins or PSPs lead to structural damage and altered function in the gills of zebrafish, including changes in histological structure and increases in the activities of AST and ALT. The inhibition of the activities of AChE and MAO suggest that aphantoxins or PSPs could induce respiratory toxicity in the zebrafish gill. Furthermore, these parameters may be used as bioindicators for investigating aphantoxin exposure and cyanobacterial blooms in nature."

Foodborne outbreaks that occurred during August 2009-July 2015 with norovirus reported as a single confirmed etiology to the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) were matched with outbreaks reported to CaliciNet, a U.

We analyzed these matched outbreaks stratified by genotype for epidemiologic characteristics, including setting, size and duration, health outcomes of case-patients, implicated food, and outbreak contributing factors. Four hundred ninety-three confirmed foodborne norovirus outbreaks were reported in both NORS and CaliciNet. The most common norovirus genotypes reported were GII.4 (52%), GII.6 (9%), and GI.3 (8%). Compared to non-GII.4 outbreaks, GII.4 outbreaks had higher hospitalization rates (12.8 vs. 4.8 per 1,000 cases, P < 0.01). While contaminated foods were identified and reported in only 35% of outbreaks, molluscan shellfish (4% overall) were more often implicated in non-GII.4 outbreaks than in GII.4 outbreaks (7% vs. 1%, P = 0.04).

It was rather unexpectedly revealed from the basis of the morphological characteristics that they were unambiguously identified as Alexandrium tamiyavanichii and Alexandrium catenella. Two strains (ATY041106, ATY051018) of A. tamiyavanichii showed a specific toxicity of 38.7 x 10(-6) and 111.5 x 10(-6)MU/cell, respectively.

From the results of HPLC-furuorometric analysis, it revealed that the toxins in ATY041106 exist almost exclusively as beta-epimers (C2, GTX3, GTX4), which accounted for 72.7 mol%. The toxin profiles of this strain are featured by the presence of a large amount of GTX3 (59.1 mol%) and a small amount (20.6%) of C1 and 2 in comparison with the PSP compositions of A. tamarense, which is isolated as the main responsible species in Hiroshima Bay, a western part of coastal sea in Hiroshima Prefecture.

Among these, an O26:H11 stx1a eae-β1 strain was associated with a large number of virulence-associated genes (n = 47), including genes carried on the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) or other pathogenicity islands, such as OI-122, OI-71, OI-43/48, OI-50, OI-57, and the high-pathogenicity island (HPI). One O91:H21 STEC strain containing 4 stx variants (stx1a, stx2a, stx2c, and stx2d) was found to possess genes associated with pathogenicity islands OI-122, OI-43/48, and OI-15. Among EPEC strains harboring a large number of virulence genes (n, 34 to 50), eight belonged to serotype O26:H11, O103:H2, O103:H25, O145:H28, O157:H7, or O153:H2. The species E. coli includes a wide variety of strains, some of which may be responsible for severe infections. This study, a molecular risk assessment study of E. coli strains isolated from the coastal environment, was conducted to evaluate the potential risk for shellfish consumers. This report describes the characterization of virulence gene profiles and stx/eae polymorphisms of E. coli isolates and clearly highlights the finding that the majority of strains isolated from coastal environment are potentially weakly pathogenic, while some are likely to be more pathogenic."

The US FDA conducted a market basket survey of dairy products and commercial fish and shellfish to obtain data on levels of 17 dioxin/furan congeners (2, 3, 7, 8-congeners) in the US. The dairy products sampled included various cheeses (American, cheddar, Swiss, cottage), ice cream, yogurt, butter, and milk. The finfish and shellfish (molluscs and crustacea) sampled are those marine species consumed in the greatest amounts and include canned tuna, shrimp, cod, blue crab, and oysters. Catfish was sampled because it is the dominant aquaculture species. Samples were collected in 1995/96 and analysis for 17 dioxin/furan congeners was performed by high-resolution gas chromatography following extraction and clean-up. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for each congener in each food were reported. Point estimates of exposure were calculated using a 3-day (1-day diary plus 2-day recall) food consumption survey for eaters-only and for the general population (USDA/CSFII, 1989-92). Toxicity equivalency factors (TEFs) developed by the World Health Organization (1997) were used to derive overall dioxin/furan toxicity equivalents (TEQ) for each sample food. Mean estimates of TEQ exposure for each food were derived using five values for non-detects (ND = 0; ND = 1/2 LOD or LOQ, ND = LOD or LOQ) on both a total sample and eaters-only basis. Using zero and the LOD provide lower and upper bounds on the range of estimated exposure, respectively. The bounds on mean dioxin intakes (pg/person/day) calculated for consumers of specific foods were estimated as follows (using zero or LOD for non-detects): butter (0.5-11), cheese (1.6-3.2), ice cream (4-19), yogurt (0.8-28), catfish (148-150), fish (other than catfish) (0.03-9), crustacea (32-35), mollusks (16.1-16.6), and shrimp (0.09-4.5). Exposure estimates derived by the five ND-methods are strongly dependent on the LOD and LOQ and represent upper bound estimates of exposure. Uncertainty in the exposure estimates is reduced with refinements in the analytical method."

To use the data to decide whether a polluted beach should remain open to the public. In Spring 1997, a chemical incident came to light at a beach on the south coast of England when a local resident reported a sulphurous smell, visible signs of oil, and reduced numbers of fishing bait. The beach was situated adjacent to a former gasworks site and was accessible to the public. The incident was reported to the local authority and was initially investigated by the Environment Agency and the local authority. An Environment Agency report confirmed contamination of the beach with cyanide, ammonia, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with associated potential health risks. The incident was then referred to the local health authorities for investigation. The investigation was carried out in four stages: comprehensive sampling and analysis to identify the extent of contamination, followed by an assessment of risk to health; establishment of a long term monitoring programme to identify any changes in contaminant concentrations; investigation of the effects of the contamination on shellfish; and review of the routine monitoring data and current sampling strategy. The initial investigation confirmed that the beach was contaminated, with the most likely source being the adjacent former gasworks site. The level of contamination was not found to be likely to pose a hazard to users of the beach. However, subsequent investigation of shellfish in the area led to warning signs being erected on the beach to prevent human consumption of mussels contaminated with PAHs. Several lessons can be learnt from this investigation, which can be applied to incident management more generally: the importance of collaboration and coordination; the need for early involvement of the health authority; and the importance of carrying out appropriate sampling and analysis as soon as possible, to assess the risk to health and the environment."

Such benthic harmful algal blooms (BHABs) have been well described from tropical and sub-tropical coastal environments, but assessments from north temperate waters, e. g. , northern Europe, and polar regions are scarce. The present study addressed the biodiversity and distribution of potentially toxic epibenthic dinoflagellate populations along the west coast of Sweden (Kattegat-Skagerrak) by morphological and molecular criteria. Morphological analysis conducted by light- and electron-microscopy was then linked by DNA barcoding of the V4 region of 18S rRNA gene sequences to interpret taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships. The presence of two potentially toxigenic epibenthic dinoflagellates, Prorocentrum lima (Ehrenberg) F. Stein and Coolia monotis Meunier was confirmed, along with a description of their spatial and temporal distribution. For P. lima, one third of the cell abundance values exceeded official alarm thresholds for potentially toxic BHAB events (>1000 cells gr-1 of macroalgae fresh weight). The same species were recorded consecutively for two summers, but without significant temporal variation in cell densities. SEM analyses confirmed the presence of other benthic Prorocentrum species: P. fukuyoi complex, P. cf. foraminosum and P. cf. hoffmannianum. Analyses of the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene also indicated the presence P. compressum, P. hoffmannianum, P. foraminosum, P. fukuyoi, and P. nanum. These findings provide the first biogeographical evidence of toxigenic benthic dinoflagellates along the west coast of Sweden, in the absence of ongoing monitoring to include epibenthic dinoflagellates. Harmful events due to the presence of Coolia at shellfish aquaculture sites along the Kattegat-Skagerrak are likely to be rather marginal because C. monotis is not known to be toxigenic. In any case, as a preliminary assessment, the results highlight the risk of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) events caused by P. lima, which may affect the development and sustainability of shellfish aquaculture in the region."

International statistics of oil spill sizes for all incidents indicate that the majority of oil spills are small (less than 7 tonnes). The major accidents that happen in the oil industry contribute only a small fraction of the total oil which enters the environment. However, the nature of accidental releases is that they highly pollute small areas and have the potential to devastate the biota locally. There are several routes by which oil can get back to humans from accidental spills, e. g. through accumulation in fish and shellfish, through consumption of contaminated groundwater. Although advances have been made in the prevention of accidents, this does not apply in all countries, and by the random nature of oil spill events, total prevention is not feasible. Therefore, considerable world-wide effort has gone into strategies for minimising accidental spills and the design of new remedial technologies. This paper summarizes new knowledge as well as research and technology gaps essential for developing appropriate decision-making tools in actual spill scenarios. Since oil exploration is being driven into deeper waters and more remote, fragile environments, the risk of future accidents becomes much higher. The innovative safety and accident prevention approaches summarized in this paper are currently important for a range of stakeholders, including the oil industry, the scientific community and the public. Ultimately an integrated approach to prevention and remediation that accelerates an early warning protocol in the event of a spill would get the most appropriate technology selected and implemented as early as possible - the first few hours after a spill are crucial to the outcome of the remedial effort. A particular focus is made on bioremediation as environmentally harmless, cost-effective and relatively inexpensive technology. Greater penetration into the remedial technologies market depends on the harmonization of environment legislation and the application of modern laboratory techniques, e. g. ecogenomics, to improve the predictability of bioremediation."

Here we confirm deaths of marine mammals from microcystin intoxication and provide evidence implicating land-sea flow with trophic transfer through marine invertebrates as the most likely route of exposure. This hypothesis was evaluated through environmental detection of potential freshwater and marine microcystin sources, sea otter necropsy with biochemical analysis of tissues and evaluation of bioaccumulation of freshwater microcystins by marine invertebrates. Ocean discharge of freshwater microcystins was confirmed for three nutrient-impaired rivers flowing into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and microcystin concentrations up to 2,900 ppm (2.9 million ppb) were detected in a freshwater lake and downstream tributaries to within 1 km of the ocean. Deaths of 21 southern sea otters, a federally listed threatened species, were linked to microcystin intoxication. Finally, farmed and free-living marine clams, mussels and oysters of species that are often consumed by sea otters and humans exhibited significant biomagnification (to 107 times ambient water levels) and slow depuration of freshwater cyanotoxins, suggesting a potentially serious environmental and public health threat that extends from the lowest trophic levels of nutrient-impaired freshwater habitat to apex marine predators. Microcystin-poisoned sea otters were commonly recovered near river mouths and harbors and contaminated marine bivalves were implicated as the most likely source of this potent hepatotoxin for wild otters. This is the first report of deaths of marine mammals due to cyanotoxins and confirms the existence of a novel class of marine ""harmful algal bloom"" in the Pacific coastal environment; that of hepatotoxic shellfish poisoning (HSP), suggesting that animals and humans are at risk from microcystin poisoning when consuming shellfish harvested at the land-sea interface."

A previous immunoassay for TTX detection in puffer fish, based on the use of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) for the immobilization of TTX on maleimide plates (mELISA), has been modified and adapted to the analysis of oyster and mussel samples. Changing dithiol for cysteamine-based SAMs enabled reductions in the assay time and cost, while maintaining the sensitivity of the assay. The mELISA showed high selectivity for TTX since the antibody did not cross-react with co-occurring paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins and no interferences were observed from arginine (Arg). Moreover, TTX-coated maleimide plates stored for 3 months at -20°C and 4°C were stable, thus when pre-prepared, the time to perform the assay is reduced. When analyzing shellfish samples, matrix effects and toxin recovery values strongly depended on the shellfish type and the sample treatment. Blank oyster extracts could be directly analyzed without solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up, whereas blank mussel extracts showed strong matrix effects and SPE and subsequent solvent evaporation were required for removal. However, the SPE clean-up and evaporation resulted in toxin loss. Toxin recovery values were taken as correction factors (CFs) and were applied to the quantification of TTX contents in the analysis of naturally-contaminated shellfish samples by mELISA. The lowest effective limits of detection (eLODs) were about 20 and 50µg/kg for oyster extracts without and with SPE clean-up, respectively, and about 30µg/kg for mussel extracts with both protocols, all of them substantially below the eLOD attained in the previous mELISA for puffer fish (230µg/kg). Analysis of naturally-contaminated samples by mELISA and comparison with LC-MS/MS quantifications demonstrated the viability of the approach. This mELISA is a selective and sensitive tool for the rapid detection of TTX in oyster and mussel samples showing promise to be implemented in routine monitoring programs to protect human health."

For this study, C. parvum oocysts (1000 and 10,000) were spiked into 10 L of water in static tank systems housing Crassostrea virginica. Oysters were either held in the contaminated aquaria for 7 days of exposure or were exposed for 24h and subsequently placed in a clean static tank system for the remainder of the trial. Individual oysters, fecal material, and tank water were analyzed for oocysts up to 7 days post-exposure via direct immunofluorescence. Oysters held under chronic exposure conditions gradually accumulated oocysts (1.5 or 34.4 oocysts/oyster/day for low or high dose exposure groups, respectively) between days 1 and 7, with an exponential uptake in oocysts observed within the first 24h post-exposure (mean uptake of 29.6 or 241.9 oocysts/oyster, respectively). Oysters that were transferred to clean water after 24h were capable of slowly depurating oocysts, following a linear trend. During chronic exposure trials 48-49% of the total spiked inoculum was recovered from oyster tissue, whereas 4.8-5.9% and 38-40% was recovered from tank water and from fecal material at day 7, respectively. In acute exposure trials, 30-31% of the total tank inoculum was found in oysters, suggesting that chronically exposed oysters were likely re-filtering some oocysts. Examinations of oyster fecal material from acute exposures revealed that 72-82% of oocysts recovered were already excreted at the time of oyster transfer (day 1), with only 18-28% being excreted during the static depuration phase. These data support that although most C. parvum oocysts are removed by C. virginica oysters within 24h, elimination after this point occurs slowly. Additionally, chronic exposures demonstrate that wild or cultured oysters in saline environments that are frequently exposed to sources of Cryptosporidium may be unable to eliminate the parasites at a rate that balances initial uptake."

Paphies australis, an endemic clam found in New Zealand, has been found to contain TTX in several locations. However, it is unknown if this represents endogenous production or accumulation from an external source. To address this question, the concentrations of TTX in whole P. australis and dissected organs (siphons, foot, digestive gland and the 'rest') from thirteen sites around New Zealand were determined using liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS). Depuration rate of TTX was also investigated by harvesting and measuring concentrations in P. australis maintained in captivity on a toxin-free diet every three to 15 days for 150 days. The LC-MS/MS analyses of the spatial samples showed that TTX was present in P. australis from all regions tested, with significantly (p < 0.001) higher concentrations (15-50 μg kg-1) observed at lower latitudes of the North Island compared with trace levels (0.5-3 μg kg-1) in the South Island of New Zealand. Tetrodotoxin was detected in all the dissected organs but the siphons contained the highest concentrations of TTX at all sites analysed. A linear model of the depuration data identified a significant (p < 0.001) decline in total TTX concentrations in P. australis over the study period. The siphons maintained the highest amount of TTX across the entire depuration study. The digestive glands contained low concentrations at the start of the experiment, but this depurated rapidly and only traces remained after 21 days. These results provide evidence to suggest that P. australis does not produce TTX endogenously but obtains the neurotoxin from an exogenous source (e. g. , diet) with the source more prevalent in warmer northern waters. The association of higher TTX concentrations in shellfish with warmer environments raises concerns that this toxin's distribution and abundance could become an increasing human health issue with global warming."

Among the analyzed elements, Pb, Ni, and Zn for some fish species exceeded the permissible dietary limit, suggested by national and international agencies. In addition, results of bioaccumulation factor (BAF) indicated that most of the studied species were bioaccumulative in nature (BAFs > 1000), and the mean BAF of elements were found in the following order: Zn (3156.74) > Ni (1629.30) > Cu (1566.77) > As (997.14) > Pb (259.98) > Cd (216.52). However, the species, L. parse being omnivorous represented the highest BAF (stored higher concentrations of metals) as compared to other species. The growth pattern of all the species was negatively allometric, and the health condition of the species varied from poor to good state revealed from the estimated Fulton's condition factor (FC). For the evaluation of health hazards, estimated weekly (EWI), target hazard quotient (THQ), and carcinogenic risk (CR) were calculated for both adults and children. Results of EWI showed As, Pb, and Ni surpassed provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI)-recommended guidelines. The non-carcinogenic health effect (TTHQ) might not appear for both types of consumers (as TTHQ < 1), and CRs of all consumers were also in acceptable range (10-6 to 10-4). However, the probabilistic distribution through Monte Carlo simulation revealed that children were more vulnerable to non-carcinogenic (67.3%) and carcinogenic risk effect (47.3%) for Pb. Meanwhile, adults obtained the probability of 0.7% and 36% for THQ and CR effect, respectively, interpreting less vulnerable."

Its ecophysiological versatility enables it to form blooms in the most diverse types of environments, from tropical to temperate, and from relatively pristine to polluted. In Peri Lake, located in the subtropical south of Brazil, growing populations of STX-producing R. raciborskii have been detected since 1994, posing risks to the use of its waters that supply a population of about 100,000 inhabitants. Despite the existence of a monitoring system for the presence and toxicity of cyanobacteria in Peri Lake water, no assessment has been made in the coastal region, downstream of outflowing lake water, thereby potentially making available a toxic biomass to natural and cultivated shellfish populations in the salt water ecosystem. To address this problem, the present study evaluated environmental variables and STX concentration by profiling the outflowing waters between Peri Lake and the adjacent coastal zone. Laboratory experiments were carried out with three strains of R. raciborskii in order to confirm the effect of salinity on STX production and verify if Perna Perna mussels fed with R. raciborskii cultures would absorb and accumulate STX. Results showed that environmental concentrations of STX reach high levels (up to 6.31 µg L-1 STX eq. ), especially in the warmer months, reaching the coastal zone. In laboratory tests, it was found that the strains tolerate salinities between 4 and 6 and that salinity influences the production of STX. In addition, mussels fed with R. raciborskii effectively absorb and accumulate STX, even in typically marine salinities (22 to 30), suggesting that R. raciborskii biomass remains available and toxic despite salinity shock. These results draw attention to the ecological and health risk associated with R. raciborskii blooms, both in the lake environment and in the adjacent marine environment, calling attention to the need to improve the monitoring and management systems for water and shellfish toxicity in the region of interest, as well as other places where toxic cyanobacteria of limnic origin can reach the coastal zone."

However, increasing pollution in the ocean caused by toxic metals has led to the bioaccumulation of toxic metals in marine animals, especially the bivalves such as clams, and the consequence of heavy metal-associated toxicity in these animals. Such toxicity can enhance the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the tissues of the animals. In aquatic species, oxidative stress mechanisms have been studied by measuring the antioxidant and oxidative damage index in the tissues. The objectives of this study were to investigate the levels of different toxic metals and the extent of oxidative stress responses in the clam Sinonovacula constricta at different growth periods (from May to October) in an aquaculture farm in Wengyang, an important economic shellfish culture zone in Zhejiang Province, China. Water and sediment samples taken from the farm were subjected to Pb, Hg, Cd, Cr assays. Overall, the levels of these metals in the water and sediment could be considered as light pollution, though the levels of Hg in the water (0.266) and Cd in the sediment (0.813) could be considered as reaching moderate pollution. In addition, the levels of these metals, H2O2, MDA and GSH content, antioxidant enzyme (CAT, SOD, GPx) activities as well as the level of metallothioneins (MT) mRNA in the tissues of S. constricta were also analyzed. The levels of Pb, Hg, Cd, Cr increased with increasing culturing time, and a higher level of these metals was accumulated in the visceral mass than in the foot. The levels of MDA and GSH, as well as the level of SOD activity in the viscera and foot of S. constricta increased with increasing metal accumulation. However, CAT and GPX activities, H2O2 level and the expression of MT initially increased and then decreased. This suggested that S. constricta might have the ability to control oxidative damage by triggering antioxidant defense in coordination with the metal sequestering response. The results also implied that toxic metal pollution should be taken into account when selecting the site to be used as an aquaculture farm. In addition, the visceral mass should be considered to be a good tissue for measuring the level of metal pollutants."

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were administered A. flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins at 5.3 or 7.61μg saxitoxin equivalents (eq)/kg (low and high doses, respectively) by intraperitoneal injection. The activities of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase (NKA), carbonic anhydrase (CA), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ultrastructural alterations in chloride and epithelial cells, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC) were investigated in the gills during the first 24h after exposure. Aphantoxins significantly increased the level of ROS and decreased the T-AOC in zebrafish gills from 3 to 12h post-exposure, suggesting an induction of oxidative stress and inhibition of antioxidant capacity. Reduced activities of NKA and CA demonstrated abnormal ion transport and gas exchange in the gills of aphantoxin-treated fish. Toxin administration also resulted in increased LDH activity and ultrastructural alterations in chloride and epithelial cells, suggesting a disruption of function and structure in zebrafish gills. The observed abnormalities in zebrafish gills occurred in a time- and dose-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that aphantoxins or PSPs may inhibit ion transport and gas exchange, increase LDH activity, and result in ultrastructural damage to the gills through elevations in oxidative stress and reduced antioxidant capacity. These effects of aphantoxins in the gills of zebrafish suggest an induction of respiratory toxicity. The parameters investigated in this study may be also considered as biomarkers for studying aphantoxin/PSP exposure and cyanobacterial blooms in nature."

We evaluated changes in marine plankton communities with prevailing physico-chemical conditions throughout an exceptionally warm summer (2018), to elucidate key factors governing HABs and their impacts on shellfish mariculture in the western English Channel. Despite warm, stable weather conditions and widespread seasonal stratification throughout the summer, divergent plankton community compositions were observed at two rope-grown mussel (Mytilus edulis) farms (St Austell Bay and Lyme Bay) and a long-term ecological research LTER site (Plymouth L4). There were significant differences between sites in the abundances of HAB species, including Dinophysis spp. and Karenia mikimotoi, whose cell counts bloomed in excess of UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) advisory 'trigger' levels at Plymouth L4 and St Austell Bay, but not at the Lyme Bay site. The K. mikimotoi bloom occurred over two weeks in August and comprised up to 88% of the standing phytoplankton biomass in St Austell Bay. Dinophysis spp. also bloomed here from May to September, constituting up to 28% of phytoplankton biomass. This protracted bloom resulted in concentrations of Dinophysis toxins 1 & 2 and pectenotoxins and okadaic acid in shellfish, which closed shellfish harvesting operations on farms located in St Austell Bay, and other shellfish sites in the west of the western English Channel (but not in the east of the region). Inter-site differences in the abundances of these and other HAB species were associated with variations in water circulation and co-occurring phytoplankton and zooplankton communities. Furthermore, plankton monitoring data obtained from the L4 site over the past 3 decades showed HAB species (including Dinophysis spp. ) with abundances commonly occurring above advisory trigger levels during warmer periods, such as that coinciding with our study. Under projected climate warming these blooms are likely to continue to be governed by regionally distinct patterns of water circulation, which need to be taken into account in marine spatial planning, when assessing the suitability of new shellfish mariculture sites."

This study examined the changing habits of anglers and consumers and characterised a range of existing and emerging contaminants in freshwater fish species with a view to determining current levels of occurrence and possible risk from consumption. The project was conducted in two stages. The first stage included (a) a study that identified freshwater systems that are contaminated either by anthropogenic activity or as a result of the geology of the area; and (b) socioeconomic research to assess the consumption habits of the public, particularly anglers, with respect to fish and shellfish from unmanaged inland waterways. Based on the outcome from the first stage, specific rivers and other inland waterways were chosen for investigation, along with the range of contaminants to be included in the analytical programme. Predicted contamination levels and prevalence of anglers were among the factors taken into consideration. The second stage of the project involved sampling and analysis of fish taken from selected locations on the chosen waterways.

EU food safety directives specify that EU Member States must implement a routine monitoring programme to mitigate risks associated with bio-accumulation of biotoxins by bivalve shellfish, such as those produced by Alexandrium. This strategic drive comprises of both direct testing of bivalve flesh for the presence of regulated toxins and an early warning phytoplankton monitoring programme. In the UK the flesh testing moved away from animal bio-assays to analytical chemistry techniques, whereas phytoplankton monitoring methods have seen little technological advancement since implementation. Methods currently utilize light microscopy and manual enumeration of different algal species. These methods although proven are time consuming, reliant on highly trained staff, have high limits of detection (LOD) with low specificity, unable to reliably identify Alexandrium to species level. The implications of these limitations of the techniques mean that in the case of Alexandrium the LOD is also the action limit and as such it is easy to miss positive samples affecting the efficacy of any early warning strategy. This study outlines the development, preliminary method characterisation, validation and trial implementation of an alternative early warning technique, utilizing quantitative PCR to identify water samples containing Alexandrium cells. The approach outlined in this document, showed an improved correlation with flesh toxicity, improved sensitivity, improved throughput compared to traditional light microscopy methods and there was also good correlation with higher cell abundance samples when compared to the light microscopy results. The application of this approach to routine water samples was explored and was found to demonstrate potential as a corroborative method for use during flesh intoxication episodes.

LST contamination data were obtained from a total of 14 species of 188 commercial samples. Eleven individual LSTs, namely okadaic acid (OA), dinophysis toxin-1 and -2 (DTX1 and DTX2), pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2), yessotoxin and homo yessotoxin (YTX and hYTX), azaspiracid-1, -2 and -3 (AZA1, AZA2, AZA3), spirolides (SPXs), and gymnodimine (GYM), were determined using liquid chromatography electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). More than two thirds of samples showed undetectable LSTs, while the detection rates (the proportion of samples with detectable LSTs) of individual LSTs ranged from 0% to 45.7%. Most shellfish samples had lower levels of LST contamination than the corresponding limits of detection (LODs), while some samples had levels of hYTX and GYM that exceeded the limits of quantification (LOQs). Overall, levels of LSTs in the 188 samples were below the regulatory limits set by most countries. Acute and chronic exposures of LST were estimated by a point-estimate modeling method that combined sample contamination data with consumption data from dietary survey of Shenzhen residents and consumption figures proposed by EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority. Seasonal variations in LST concentrations were noted in some instances. Overall, the estimated acute exposure to LSTs based on consumption of large-size shellfish portions and the maximum LSTs contamination level were below the provisional acute reference doses (ARfDs) proposed by the EFSA. Chronic exposure estimates based on mean and 99th percentile consumption of shellfish by Shenzhen residents and mean LSTs contamination levels in the collected samples were from 2452 to 74 times lower than those associated with estimated acute exposure levels."

Various programs have been established that are effective in reducing risks associated with these toxicants in food. These programs include setting regulatory limits, monitoring susceptible commodities for toxin levels, and using decontamination procedures. Bioassays have been used traditionally to monitor suspect products. All traditional bioassays, however, have one common disadvantage, i. e. , the lack of specificity for individual toxins. The lack of available reference standards for specific toxins has also hampered implementation of monitoring programs. Utilizing the knowledge gained with regulatory monitoring and decontamination programs for other toxins, e. g. , aflatoxin, similar seafood safety programs can be developed for aquatic biotoxins that will reduce risks and hazards associated with the contaminant to practicable levels and help to preserve an adequate food supply. Research is needed in several areas identified in this article. International cooperation has an important role in achieving these essential elements. Global programs will help in the adequate management of risks associated with aquatic biotoxins. To have an effective monitoring program, it is necessary to define precisely the local needs for information in a short or long time range. It is necessary to have basic knowledge about the biological, chemical, and physical conditions as well as temporal and geographic variations within the region of interest (2). Regardless of the overall success of fish/shellfish toxin monitoring plans, emergencies will occur. Therefore, contingency plans should be developed so there will be no misunderstanding of what actions to take (148). In general, however, the structure of the program must be kept as simple as possible to facilitate fast and uncomplicated flow of information among the various organizations and individuals involved (2). Public health and safety requires the removal of any toxic shellfish from the market, within practicability, and closure of any suspect harvest area. It should be important to remember that economic value of the fish or shellfish resource is always secondary to public health and safety (148)."

Out of 130 short mackerel samples, 116 (89.2%) were detected with the presence of total V. parahaemolyticus and microbial loads of total V. parahaemolyticus ranging from <3 to >105 MPN/g. Prevalence of total V. parahaemolyticus was found highest in wet markets (95.2%) followed by minimarkets (89.1%) and hypermarkets (83.3%). Pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus strains (tdh+ and/or trh+) were detected in 16.2% (21 of 130) of short mackerel samples. The density of tdh+ V. parahaemolyticus strains were examined ranging from 3.6 to >105 MPN/g and microbial loads of V. parahaemolyticus strains positive for both tdh and trh were found ranging from 300 to 740 MPN/g. On the other hand, antibiotic susceptibility profiles of V. parahaemolyticus strains isolated from short mackerels were determined through disc diffusion method in this study. Assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility profile of V. parahaemolyticus revealed majority of the isolates were highly susceptible to ampicillin sulbactam, meropenem, ceftazidime, and imipenem, but resistant to penicillin G and ampicillin. Two isolates (2.99%) exhibited the highest multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index value of 0.41 which shown resistance to 7 antibiotics.

However, little is known about the effects of crude oil and dispersant on the human fecal microbiota. The aim of this research was to evaluate the potential effects of Deepwater Horizon crude oil, Corexit 9500 dispersant, and their combination on human fecal microbial communities, using an in vitro culture test system. Fecal specimens from healthy adult volunteers were made into suspensions, which were then treated with oil, dispersant, or oil-dispersant mixtures under anaerobic conditions in an in vitro culture test system. Perturbations of the microbial community, compared to untreated control cultures, were assessed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), real-time PCR, and pyrosequencing methods. DGGE and pyrosequencing analysis showed that oil-dispersant mixtures reduced the diversity of fecal microbiota from all individuals. Real-time PCR results indicated that the copy numbers of 16S rRNA genes in cultures treated with dispersed oil or oil alone were significantly lower than those in control incubations. The abundance of the Bacteroidetes decreased in crude oil-treated and dispersed-oil-treated cultures, while the Proteobacteria increased in cultures treated with dispersed oil. In conclusion, the human fecal microbiota was affected differently by oil and dispersed oil, and the influence of dispersed oil was significantly greater than that of either oil or dispersant alone compared to control cultures. IMPORTANCE There have been concerns whether human health is adversely affected by exposure to spilled crude oil, which contains regulated carcinogens, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In this study, we determined the effect of BP Deepwater Horizon crude oil and oil dispersant on the human intestinal microbiota, since there is the potential that low-level residues of petrochemicals could contaminate seafood. The results of this study will increase our understanding of the ecophysiological changes in the microbial communities of the human gastrointestinal tract with respect to crude oil exposure."

The analytical methodology used (13)C(12) labelled surrogates of the target compounds, with GC coupled to (usually) high resolution MS, and LC-MS/MS for HBCD and TBBPA analysis. Positive identifications were made in the majority of samples for most analytes with the exception of TBBPA and most PBDD congeners measured. None of the levels detected for PCDD/F and PCB were above the maximum permitted levels specified in European Union regulations. The levels of brominated furans predominated over brominated dioxins, reflecting the environmental distribution and source emission profiles of these contaminants, and relatively high levels of the tri-brominated congeners were observed. Levels of the flame retardant chemicals reflected current and legacy use, with appreciable concentrations of PBDEs and HBCDs (predominantly alpha-HBCD) but far lower levels of PBBs. TBBPA was not detected in any of the species. In general, mussels and oysters displayed relatively higher levels of contamination than scallops, although the gonad tissue of the latter showed significant levels of brominated dioxins. The estimated adult dietary intakes of PCDD/Fs and PCBs arising from the consumption of a typical portion of these foods in combination with an otherwise average UK diet were in the range 0.5-0.6 pg World Health Organisation (WHO)-toxic equivalent (TEQ)(2005)/kg bodyweight per day. These estimated dietary intakes are well within the Tolerable Daily Intake for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs of 2 pg WHO-TEQ(2005)/kg bodyweight/day endorsed by the independent expert Committee on Toxicology of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment. The corresponding intakes for sumPBDEs and sumHBCDs were 5.6-6.1 and 5.9-7.9 ng/kg bodyweight/day respectively."

Here we report the results of an extensive sampling effort that ultimately led PR authorities to issue the first State shellfish-harvesting ban due to multi-species okadaic acid (OA) contamination. During its peak, the bloom covered an area of 201 km2 (∼2.0-3.5 × 54.0 km), attaining unprecedentedly high cell densities along the shallow (<15 m) continental shelf (mean 2.2 × 105, maximum 2.1 × 106 cells L-1) and adjacent sandy beaches (mean 2.8 × 105, maximum 5.2 × 106 cells L-1). Only OA was detected in suspension (max. 188 ng L-1). Toxin levels measured in bivalves were several times greater than the regulatory limit of 160 ng g-1, reaching up to 3600 ng g-1 in Crassostrea gasar, by far the highest OA concentrations ever reported in oysters worldwide, 7700 ng g-1 in brown mussels, Perna perna, and lower levels in clams, Anomalocardia brasiliana, and mangrove mussels, Mytella spp. Nine cases of human intoxication were officially reported and five people were hospitalized with typical symptoms of Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning linked to the consumption of contaminated bivalves. All bivalves quickly converted most of the OA into its esterified form, DTX-3, and eliminated the toxins only a few weeks following the bloom, with C. gasar being the slowest-detoxifying species. Lower OA levels were accumulated in zooplankton, gastropods and several novel toxin vectors, including benthic organisms such as sand dollars Mellita quinquiesperforata and the ghost-shrimp Callichirus major, which may act as a good indicator of the presence of toxins in sandy beaches, and pelagic fish species that can serve as potential alternative sources of OA to humans (Chaetodipterus faber and Mugil liza). Monitoring toxin contamination in seafood other than bivalves is thus recommended to ensure comprehensive human health protection during massive Dinophysis blooms. Additionally, since OA was also present at low concentrations in the liver of Guiana dolphins Sotalia guianensis and penguins Spheniscus magellanicus, exposure to biotoxins should be considered in conservation actions involving threatened and near-threatened marine organisms in this region."

FRNA bacteriophage and E. coli levels were determined over a 2-year period for oysters (Crassostrea gigas) harvested from four commercial sites chosen to represent various degrees of sewage pollution. Three sites were classified as category B sites under the relevant European Community (EC) Directive (91/492), which required purification (depuration) of oysters from these sites before sale. One site was classified as a category A site, and oysters from this site could be sold directly without further processing. Samples were tested at the point of sale following commercial processing and packaging. All of the shellfish complied with the mandatory EC E. coli standard (less than 230 per 100 g of shellfish flesh), and the levels of contamination for more than 90% of the shellfish were at or below the level of sensitivity of the assay (20 E. coli MPN per 100 g), which indicated good quality based on this criterion. In contrast, FRNA bacteriophage were frequently detected at levels that exceeded 1,000 PFU per 100 g. High levels of FRNA bacteriophage contamination were strongly associated with harvest area fecal pollution and with shellfish-associated disease outbreaks. Interestingly, FRNA bacteriophage contamination exhibited a marked seasonal trend that was consistent with the trend of oyster-associated gastroenteritis in the United Kingdom. The correlation between FRNA bacteriophage contamination and health risk was investigated further by using a reverse transcription-PCR assay for Norwalk-like virus (NLV). NLV contamination of oysters was detected only at the most polluted site and also exhibited a seasonal trend that was consistent with the trend of FRNA bacteriophage contamination and with the incidence of disease. The results of this study suggest that FRNA bacteriophage could be used as viral indicators for market-ready oysters."

The lake is populated by a complex mixture of cyanobacteria, with toxigenic strains that produce microcystins, anatoxins, and paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins (PSTs). Samples collected from 24 sites were analyzed for these three toxin classes over four years spanning 2014-2017. Concentrations of the three toxin groups varied widely both within and between years. During the study, the mean and median concentrations of microcystins, anatoxin-a, and PSTs were 91 and 4.0 μg/L, 0.62 and 0.33 μg/L, and 32 and 16 μg/L, respectively. Dihydro-anatoxin was only detected once in Chautauqua Lake, while homo-anatoxin was never detected. The Northern Basin had larger basin-wide higher biomass blooms with higher concentrations of toxins relative to the more eutrophied Southern Basin, however blooms in the North Basin were infrequent. Chlorophyll concentrations and toxins in the two basins were correlated with different sets of environmental and physical parameters, suggesting that implementing controls to reduce toxin loads may require applications focused on more than reductions in cyanobacterial bloom density (e. g. , reduction of phosphorus inputs), and that lake limnological factors and morphology are important determinants in the selection of an appropriate management strategy. Chautauqua Lake is a drinking water source and is also heavily used for recreation. Drinking water from Chautauqua Lake is unlikely to be a significant source of exposure to cyanotoxins due to the location of the intakes in the deeper North Basin, where there were generally low concentrations of toxins in open water; however, toxin levels in many blooms exceeded the US Environmental Protection Agency's recreational guidelines for exposure to cyanotoxins. Current cyanotoxin monitoring in Chautauqua Lake is focused on microcystins. However, the occurrence of blooms containing neurotoxic cyanotoxins in the absence of the microcystins indicates this restricted monitoring may not be sufficient when aiming to protect against exposure to cyanotoxins. The lake has a large number of tourist visitors; thus, special care should be taken to prevent recreational exposure within this group."

The bacterium resides in aquatic environments worldwide. Identification of risk factors of V. cholerae in aquatic products is imperative for assuming food safety. In this study, we determined virulence-associated genes, cross-resistance between antibiotics and heavy metals, and genome fingerprinting profiles of non O1/O139 V. cholerae isolates (n = 20) recovered from 16 species of consumable aquatic animals. Secretomes and proteomes of V. cholerae with distinct genotypes and phenotypes were obtained by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-GE) and/or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques. Comparative secretomic analysis revealed 4 common and 45 differential extracellular proteins among 20 V. cholerae strains, including 13 virulence- and 8 resistance-associated proteins. A total of 21,972 intracellular proteins were identified, and comparative proteomic analysis revealed 215 common and 913 differential intracellular proteins, including 22 virulence- and 8 resistance-associated proteins. Additionally, different secretomes and proteomes were observed between V. cholerae isolates of fish and shellfish origins. A number of novel proteins with unknown function and strain-specific proteins were also discovered in the V. cholerae isolates. SIGNIFICANCE: V. cholerae can cause pandemic cholera in humans. The bacterium is distributed in aquatic environments worldwide. Identification of risk factors of V. cholerae in aquatic products is imperative for assuming food safety. Non-O1/O139 V. cholerae has been reported to cause sporadic cholera-like diarrhea and bacteremia diseases, which indicates virulence factors rather than the major cholera toxin (CT) exist. This study for the first time investigated proteomes and secretomes of non-O1/O139 V. cholerae originating from aquatic animals. This resulted in the identification of a number of virulence and coresistance-related factors, as well as novel proteins and strain-specific proteins in V. cholerae isolates recovered from 16 species of consumable aquatic animals. These results fill gaps for better understanding of pathogenesis and resistance of V. cholerae, and also support the increasing need for novel diagnosis and vaccine targets against the leading waterborne pathogen worldwide."

While their filtering of the water can lead to their build-up of organic and inorganic materials that can be sampled and analyzed, this can also lead to bioaccumulation of harmful substances, such as essential and non-essential elements, that can harm the human health if in taken in high concentrations or for a long period of time. In the present study, the trace metal content (Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) of two sessile crustaceans, 20 Mytilus galloprovincialis (mussel) and 20 Tapes decussatus (clam) in Faro and Ganzirri Lakes (Messina, Sicily, Italy) were analyzed. Haemolymph samples were taken on both molluscs in order to analyze the haemocyte population by flow cytometric analysis. Unpaired t-tests were used to determine significant differences for the essential and non-essential metallic elements concentrations in the lake waters and in the tissues of M. galloprovincialis and T. decussatus and for hemocyte populations R1 (halinocytes) and R2 (granulocytes). The results suggested that that in Faro Lake, the tissue Al, Cr and Pb levels in M. galloprovincialis were higher than those for T. decussatus, in contrast to Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd, which were higher in T. decussatus. Unpaired t-tests showed that there were significantly higher proportions of halinocytes in M. galloprovincialis versus T. decussatus for both Faro Lake (41.8 % vs. 24.3 %; P < 0.001) and Ganzirri Lake (43.0 % vs. 22.4 %; P < 0.001). In contrast, while there were significantly higher proportions of granulocytes in Faro Lake (21.2 % vs. 9.1 %; P < 0.001), this difference was not seen for the granulocytes of M. galloprovincialis versus T. decussatus in Ganzirri Lake (9.6 % vs. 13.0 %). This study shows that M. galloprovincialis and T. decussatus can indeed bioaccumulate some of these metal, such that activation of the immune responses is specific to certain cell types. Future research must focus on the balance of trace elements in the consumption of these shellfish, and analyzes with more sophisticated tools can be used to diagnose the increased concentration of trace elements and the quantification of trace metals from shellfish to clams."

Control of Cryptosporidium in shellfish harvest seawater in Canada is not mandatory and, despite relay/depuration processes, the parasite can remain viable in oysters for at least a month (depending on initial loads and seawater characteristics). Risks of human infection and illness from exposure to oysters contaminated with Cryptosporidium oocysts were assessed in a Bayesian framework. Two data sets were used: counts of oocysts in oysters harvested in Approved, Restricted, and Prohibited zones of the Hillsborough River system; and oocyst elimination rate from oysters exposed to oocysts in laboratory experiments. A total of 20 scenarios were assessed according to number of oysters consumed in a single serving (1, 10 and 30) and different relay times. The median probability of infection and developing cryptosporidiosis (e. g. illness) due to the consumption of raw oysters in Prince Edward Island was zero for all scenarios. However, the 95th percentiles ranged from 2% to 81% and from 1% to 59% for probability of infection and illness, respectively. When relay times were extended from 14 to 30 days and 10 oysters were consumed in one serving from the Restricted zones, these probabilities were reduced from 35% to 16% and from 15% to 7%, respectively. The 14-day relay period established by Canadian authorities for harvesting in Restricted zones seems prudent, though insufficient, as this relay period has been shown to be enough to eliminate fecal coliforms but not Cryptosporidium oocysts, which can remain viable in the oyster for over a month. Extending relay periods of 14 and 21 days for oysters harvested in Restricted zones to 30 days is likely insufficient to substantially decrease the probability of infection and illness. The highest risk was found for oysters that originated in Prohibited zones. Our findings suggest that Cryptosporidium oocysts are a potential cause of foodborne infection and illness when consuming raw oysters from Hillsborough River, one of the most important oyster production bays on Prince Edward Island. We discuss data gaps and limitations of this work in order to identify future research that can be used to reduce the uncertainties in predicted risks."

It is contended that these so-called atypical results are due to procedural artefacts of the MBA; so far, several studies have failed to identify their cause. This paper critically assesses the development, regulatory use and methodological deficiencies of the MBA. It also discusses how testing for DSP toxins could and should have been improved and made more humane by applying the Three Rs concept of Reduction, Refinement and Replacement, and by the proper validation of the test method used. It is concluded that the MBA should not have been developed for the routine screening of shellfish samples, as it has a substantially severe endpoint and is not used as part of a tiered-testing strategy with non-animal methods. Moreover, during the UK monitoring programme for DSP toxins, the assay has been used without an optimised and universal protocol, and apparently without due regard to the principles of basic scientific methodology. In view of this, the atypical results obtained for cockle samples cannot be relied on as evidence of a human health hazard. It is recommended that the use of the MBA should be discontinued as soon as possible, in favour of other methods, especially those involving non-animal techniques. In the short-term, these methods should be based on analytical chemical detection systems and the essential availability of the relevant pure toxin standards. The lack of any known toxins in samples should be taken as evidence of lack of contamination. The suitability of the existing non-animal methods needs to be assessed as a matter of urgency. It is crucial that all new methods should be properly validated, and that their acceptability for their stated purposes should be endorsed by recognised criteria and validation centres, before being recommended to, or required by, regulatory agencies. In this way, the possibility that scientifically unsuitable methods will once again be used for monitoring for the contamination of shellfish with toxins can be avoided. This gross misuse of laboratory animals and ill-judged application of science should never be allowed to occur again."

Studying those responses is essential to better describe and predict their impact on shellfish aquaculture and health risk for humans. In this study we recorded for two months the physiological response of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis from Eastern Canada to a one-week exposure to a paralytic shellfish poisoning producing dinoflagellate strain of Alexandrium catenella, isolated from the St Lawrence estuary, Canada. Mussels in a 'control' treatment were fed continuously with a non-toxic diet, while mussels in a 'starvation' treatment were fed the same non-toxic diet the first week and subsequently starved for seven weeks. Mussels in a 'toxic' treatment received A. catenella for one week before being starved until the end of the experiment. Over a two-month experiment we monitored shell and tissue growth, filtration capacity, respiration rate, byssal attachment strength, valve opening behaviour, and toxin content in tissues. Mussels fed normally on the toxic dinoflagellate and accumulated an average of 51.6 µg STXeq 100 g-1 after one week of exposure. After seven weeks of depuration, about half of the specimen showed levels around 18 µg STXeq 100 g-1. The condition index of exposed mussels ('toxic' treatment) decreased rapidly from the start as compared to mussels that received a one-week non-toxic diet ('starvation' treatment). Oxygen consumption rates increased in the 'toxic' treatment before leveling out with that of mussels from the 'starvation' treatment. Valve opening amplitude was lower in the 'toxic' treatment during and following the exposure. Average valve closure duration was higher right after the exposure, during the peak of mussel tissue intoxication. No significant change in byssal thread strength was observed through time in each treatment but less force was required to detach mussels from the 'toxic' and 'starvation' treatments. The number of byssus threads produced by mussels exposed to the toxic dinoflagellate was also lower than in the control group. These results represent advancements in our understanding of the impacts of harmful algae on bivalves and contribute to the development of mitigation measures necessary to both the safety of consumers and the sustainability of aquaculture operations."

Oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defense responses in the zebrafish brain were investigated at various timepoints at 1-24h post-exposure. Aphantoxin exposure was associated with significantly increased (>1-2 times) reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in zebrafish brain compared with the controls at 1-12h postexposure, suggestive of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In contrast, reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in the zebrafish brain exposed to high or low doses of aphantoxins decreased by 44.88% and 41.33%, respectively, after 1-12h compared with the controls, suggesting that GSH participated in detoxification to ROS and MDA. Further analysis showed a significant increase in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) compared with the controls, suggesting elimination of oxidative stress by the antioxidant response in zebrafish brain. All these changes were dose and time dependent. These results suggested that aphantoxins or PSPs increased ROS and MDA and decreased GSH in zebrafish brain, and these changes induced oxidative stress. The increased activity of SOD, CAT and GPx demonstrated that these antioxidant enzymes could play important roles in eliminating excess ROS and MDA. These results also suggest that MDA, ROS, GSH and these three antioxidant enzymes in the brain of zebrafish may act as bioindicators for investigating A. flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins or PSPs and algal blooms in nature."

Human adaptive actions based on future scenarios of bloom dynamics and shifts in biogeographical distribution under climate-change parameters remain under development and not yet implemented on a regional scale. In the CoCliME (Co-development of climate services for adaptation to changing marine ecosystems) project these issues were addressed with respect to past, current and anticipated future status of key HAB genera and expected benefits of enhanced monitoring. Data on the distribution and frequency of Alexandrium blooms related to paralytic shellfish toxin (PST) events from key CoCliME Case Study areas, comprising the North Sea and adjacent Kattegat-Skagerrak, Norwegian Sea, and Baltic Sea, and eastern North Atlantic marginal seas, were evaluated in a contemporary and historical context over the past several decades. The first evidence of possible biogeographical expansion of Alexandrium taxa into eastern Arctic gateways was provided from DNA barcoding signatures. Various key climate change indicators, such as salinity, temperature, and water-column stratification, relevant to Alexandrium bloom initiation and development were identified. The possible influence of changing variables on bloom dynamics, magnitude, frequency and spatial and temporal distribution were interpreted in the context of regional ocean climate models. These climate change impact indicators may play key roles in selecting for the occurrence and diversity of Alexandrium species within the broader microeukaryote communities. For example, shifts to higher temperature and lower salinity regimes predicted for the southern North Sea indicate the potential for increased Alexandrium blooms, currently absent from this area.

For receiving waters designated for recreational use, disinfection during the winter months is often considered unnecessary due to reduced recreational usage, and assumptions that lower temperatures may reduce pathogen accumulation. For a river subject to seasonal disinfection, we sought to evaluate whether fecal coliforms accumulate during the winter to concentrations that would impair river water quality. Samples were collected from municipal wastewater outfalls along the river, as well as upstream and downstream of each outfall during the winter, when disinfection is not practiced, and during the summer, when disinfection is practiced. During both seasons, fecal coliform concentrations reached 2000-5000 CFU/100 mL, nearly an order of magnitude higher than levels targeted for the river to achieve primary contact recreational uses. During the summer, wastewater effluents were not significant contributors to fecal coliform loadings to the river. During the winter, fecal coliform accumulated along the river predominantly due to loadings from successive wastewater outfalls. In addition to the exceedance of fecal coliform criteria within the river, the accumulation of wastewater-derived fecal coliform along the river during the winter season suggests that wastewater outfalls may contribute elevated loads of pathogens to the commercial shellfish operations occurring at the mouth of the river. Reductions in fecal coliform concentrations between wastewater outfalls were attributed to dilution or overall removal. Combining discharge measurements from gauging stations, tributaries and wastewater outfalls to estimate seepage, dilution between wastewater outfalls was estimated, along with the percentage of the river deriving from wastewater outfalls. After accounting for dilution, the residual reductions in fecal coliform concentrations observed between outfalls were attributed to actual fecal coliform removal. The estimated rate of removal of 1.52 d(-1) was significantly higher than die-off rates determined by previous researchers at similarly low temperatures in laboratory batch experiments, indicating the potential importance of other removal mechanisms, such as predation or sedimentation."

One of the commonly perceived disadvantages of using this method is the long turnaround time and low throughput in a busy laboratory environment. The chromatographic analysis of each sample typically utilizes a 15 min cycle time to achieve toxin oxidation product separation and column equilibration prior to subsequent analysis. A standard RP C18 analytical column, used successfully in recent years, achieves good separation with a long column lifetime. The analysis of a 40 sample qualitative screening batch takes approximately 18 h, including blanks, standards, and other QC samples. The availability of superficially porous column technology has offered the potential to reduce analysis time while retaining column performance on existing hardware. In this study, AOAC Official Method 2005.06 with LC-FLD was transferred to two different commercially available superficially porous columns, and the method performance characteristics were evaluated. Both columns separated all toxins adequately with cycle times less than half that of the existing method. Linearity for each toxin was acceptable up to two times the European maximum permitted limit of 800 microg di-HCl saxitoxin equivalent/kg flesh. LOD and LOQ values were substantially improved for the majority of toxins, with gonyautoxin 1&4 and neosaxitoxin showing up to a two- and fourfold improvement, respectively, depending on the column used. Quantification results obtained from parallel analysis of contaminated samples were acceptable on both columns. Comparative screen results gave a slight increase in the occurrence of contaminated samples, which was attributed to the improved detection limit for most toxins. Issues with rapidly increasing back pressure, however, were identified with both columns, with a limit of around 500 injections. This compares to the >3000 cycles routinely obtained with the standard RP-C18 HPLC columns currently in use. Overall, the gain achieved with these columns through shorter analysis time and improved analytical sensitivity is potentially of benefit in a high-throughput environment. For the routine high-throughput screening of shellfish samples, however, an improved column lifetime is desirable."

As a potential tool to improve the assessment of enhanced concentrations of (210)Po in routine dose assessments, a formal statistical test, where the null hypothesis is that the Whitehaven area is contaminated with (210)Po, was applied to sample data. This statistical, modified ""green"", test has been used in assessments of chemicals by the OSPAR commission. It involves comparison of the reported environmental concentrations of (210)Po in a given aquatic species against its corresponding Background Assessment Concentration (BAC), which is based upon environmental samples collected from regions assumed to be not enhanced by industrial sources of (210)Po, over the period for which regular monitoring data are available (1990-2010). Unlike RIFE, these BAC values take account of the variability of the natural background level. As an example, for 2010 data, crab, lobster, mussels and winkles passed the modified ""green"" test (i. e. the null hypothesis is rejected) and as such are deemed not to be enhanced. Since the cessation of phosphoric acid production in 1992, the modified ""green"" test pass rate for crustaceans is ∼53% and ∼64% for molluscs. Results of dose calculations are made (i) using the RIFE approach and (ii) with the application of the modified ""green"" test, where samples passing the modified ""green"" test are assumed to have background levels and hence zero enhancement of (210)Po. Applying the modified ""green"" test reduces the dose on average by 44% over the period of this study (1990-2010)."

Rapid cooling during periods when the growing waters exceed 80 °F (26.7 °C) results in cold shock, which causes unacceptable mortalities in clams. The clam industry was looking for a procedure to lower the clams to the standard temperature while minimizing shell shock mortalities during the warm summer months. Three tempering treatments were examined, and total aerobic plate counts (APCs) and most-probable-number (MPN) counts of Vibrio, V. parahaemolyticus, and fecal coliforms were enumerated. In treatment 1 (control), clams were harvested, held for 5 h at 90 °F (32.2 °C), and then moved to 45 °F (7.2 °C) for storage. In treatment 2, clams were harvested and held for 5 h at 90 °F (32.2 °C), followed by 12 h at 65 °F (18.3 °C) and 12 h at 55 °F (12.8 °C), and then were moved to 45 °F (7.2 °C) for long-term storage. In treatment 3, clams were harvested and held for 5 h at 90 °F (32.2 °C), followed by 24 h at 55 °F (12.8 °C) before being moved to 45 °F (7.2 °C) for long-term storage. Three replicate trials were performed with triplicate analyses during late June through early to mid-August. The current National Shellfish Sanitation Program standard is treatment 1; it contained statistically (P ≤ 0.05) higher total APCs than treatments 2 and 3 throughout the 21-day storage period. APCs ranged from 2.3 × 10(4) immediately after harvest to 2.7 × 10(6), 1.6 × 10(5), and 4.8 × 10(5) for treatments 1, 2, and 3, respectively, after 14 days of storage. A statistical analysis showed that treatments 2 and 3 had significantly lower total MPN per gram Vibrio than treatment 1 on day 7 but were equal to treatment 1 on days 1 and 14. MPN per gram for V. parahaemolyticus was statistically lower in treatments 2 and 3 than in treatment 1 on storage days 1 and 7. However, on day 14, treatment 3 was significantly lower than treatments 1 and 2. There was no statistical difference for fecal coliforms. The greatest mortality occurred in treatment 1 (87.4%), followed by treatment 2 (83.3%) and treatment 3 (66.0%). The outcome of this research clearly shows that treatments 2 and 3 can cool clams to a temperature of 45 °F (7.2 °C) without compromising quality or safety and can reduce the number of dead clams introduced into the marketplace."

The PbTxs are highly potent polyether toxins produced during blooms of several species of marine dinoflagellates, most notably Karenia brevis. Blooms of K. brevis have been associated with massive fish kills, marine mammal poisoning, and are potentially responsible for adverse human health effects such as respiratory irritation and airway constriction in beach-goers. Additionally, the consumption of shellfish contaminated with PbTxs results in neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether PbTx could induce DNA damage in a human cell type, the lymphocyte, and if so, whether the damage could be antagonized or ameliorated by brevenal, a brevetoxin antagonist. The DNA damage may occur through both endogenous and exogenous physiological and pathophysiological processes. Unrepaired or erroneously repaired DNA damage may result in gene mutation, chromosome aberration, and modulation of gene regulation, which have been associated with immunotoxicity and carcinogenesis. A single-cell gel electrophoresis assay, or comet assay, was used to determine and compare DNA damage following various treatments. The data were expressed as tail moments, which is the percentage of DNA in the tail multiplied by the length between the center of the head and center of the tail (in arbitrary units). The negative control tail moment was 29.2 (SE=+/-0.9), whereas the positive control (hydrogen peroxide) was 72.1 (1.5) and solvent (ethanol) was 24.2 (2.1).

These compounds may cause oxidative stress and accumulate in bivalve tissues, which become vectors of intoxication to human consumers. We investigated DST accumulation, detoxification and oxidative stress biomarkers in clams (Anomalocardia flexuosa) experimentally exposed to P. lima cells or their compounds. Experimental diets consisted of 6000 cells mL-1 of the non-toxic chlorophyte Tetraselmis sp. (C; control condition), and combinations of C with 10 P. lima cells mL-1 (T10), 100 P. lima cells mL-1 (T100), or to a toxin concentration of ∼4 μg OA L-1 and ∼0.65 μg DTX-1 L-1 (T100d). Clams were exposed to these diets for 7 days (uptake phase), followed by a 7-day depuration period. No DSTs were detected in clams exposed to treatments C (control) nor to T100d (dissolved compounds) during either uptake or detoxification phase. Conversely, clams exposed to T10 or T100 accumulated, on average, up to 2.5 and 35 μg DST kg-1 in their whole bodies at the end of the uptake phase. These concentrations are ∼64 and ∼4.5 times lower than the regulatory level of 160 μg OA kg-1, respectively. Accumulated OA quotas were 12-22 times higher in the digestive gland (DG) than in remaining tissues over the uptake phase. Quick toxin transformation was indicated by the early detection of conjugated compounds - DTX-1 and OA esters - in the DG after 6 h of exposure, with OA-ester representing the main compound (30 - 100 %) in that tissue over the experiment. During the depuration period, detoxification rates represented 0.024 h-1, 0.04 h-1 and 0.052 h-1 for OA, DTX-1 and OA-ester, respectively. The activities of catalase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase and the levels of oxidative stress by lipoperoxidation varied similarly in the DG of A. flexuosa individuals subjected to T100, T100d and the control condition. However, contrasting antioxidant responses were measured in those exposed to T10. These findings indicate that no oxidative stress was primarily induced by DST-producing dinoflagellates in this clam species under laboratory conditions representative of toxic bloom situations. Even though, possible interactions should be considered under multistressor scenarios."

Benthic organisms are especially vulnerable as they are exposed to both benthic and planktonic species causative of harmful algal blooms (HABs). While benthic algae can come into direct contact with annelids during substrate remobilization, planktonic cells can settle to the bottom mostly during senescence and/or encystment stages, and in shallow and calm waters. We performed a systematic, qualitative review of the literature on the phycotoxin TK and TD processes in marine annelids, summarizing the most relevant findings and general trends. Besides, by using innovative analytical/statistical approaches, we were able to detect patterns and gaps in the current literature, thus pointing to future research directions. We retrieved and analyzed studies involving diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DSTs), paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), brevetoxins (PbTXs), domoic acid (DA), as well as palytoxin and its congeners, the ovatoxins (treated together as PLTXs). It is worth mentioning that studies evaluating other phycotoxins (e. g. , ciguatoxins, yessotoxins) were not found in the literature. The absence of data on PbTXs, PSTs and DA is the largest gap hampering TK assessment in annelids, although some relevant information on TD is already available. Whereas lethal effects from DSTs have not been reported, more potent toxins like PbTXs, PSTs, DA and those grouped as PLTX-like compounds can cause mortality and/or marked decrease in annelid abundance. In addition, phycotoxins have been linked to sublethal effects on annelid cells. Although very sparse, field and laboratory studies offer strong evidence that annelids may be reliable indicators of toxin exposure and their negative effects during both early and later stages of HABs in marine environments. Besides quickly responding to these compounds at both organismic and suborganismic levels, annelids are easily found in areas affected by HABs. The use of annelids in future investigations evaluating the action mechanisms of toxic microalgae on marine invertebrates should be thus encouraged. In this case, the choice for widely dispersed and numerically dominant species of annelids would strengthen the validation and extrapolation of results from risk assessments in areas affected by HABs worldwide."

The validation included the toxins okadaic acid (OA), yessotoxin (YTX), azaspiracid-1 (AZA1), pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2) and 13-desmethyl spirolide-C (SPX1). Validation was performed at 0.5, 1 and 1.5 times the current EU permitted levels, which are 160 microg kg(-1) for OA, AZA1 and PTX2 and 1,000 microg kg(-1) for YTX. For SPX1, 400 microg kg(-1) was chosen as the target level as no legislation has been established yet for this compound. The method was validated for determination in crude methanolic shellfish extracts and for extracts purified by solid-phase extraction (SPE). Extracts were also subjected to hydrolysis conditions to determine the performance of the method for OA and dinophysistoxin esters. The toxins were quantified against a set of matrix-matched standards instead of standard solutions in methanol. To save valuable standard, methanolic extract instead of the homogenate was spiked with the toxin standard. This was justified by the fact that the extraction efficiency is high for all relevant toxins (above 90%). The method performed very well with respect to accuracy, intraday precision (repeatability), interday precision (within-laboratory reproducibility), linearity, decision limit, specificity and ruggedness. At the permitted level the accuracy ranged from 102 to 111%, the repeatability from 2.6 to 6.7% and the reproducibility from 4.7 to 14.2% in crude methanolic extracts. The crude extracts performed less satisfactorily with respect to the linearity (less than 0.990) and the change in LC-MS/MS sensitivity during the series (more than 25%). SPE purification resulted in greatly improved linearity and signal stability during the series. Recently the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has suggested that to not exceed the acute reference dose the levels should be below 45 microg kg(-1) OA equivalents and 30 microg kg(-1) AZA1 equivalents. A single-day validation was successfully conducted at these levels. If the regulatory levels are lowered towards the EFSA suggested values, the official methods prescribed in legislation (mouse and rat bioassay) will no longer be sensitive enough. The validated LC-MS/MS method presented has the potential to replace these animal tests."

In addition, the target hazard quotients (THQ) were used to evaluate the potential risk of heavy metals in shellfish on human body. Results showed that the concentrations of heavy metals in shellfish ranged at the following sequence: Cr > Cd > Pb > Hg. The concentrations of Hg and Pb in most samples were below the limits (0.3 mg kg(-1) for Hg and 0.5 mg kg(-1) for Pb) of national standard (GB 18406.4-2001) set in China. About 57 % of samples were found to contain more than 0.1 mg kg(-1) of Cd, in which the highest level was found in oyster from Xiangan with a value of 1.21 mg kg(-1).

The calculated daily intakes of Hg, Pb, Cd, and Cr through consuming the shellfish were 0.005, 0.122, 0.137, and 1.20 μg kg(-1) day(-1), respectively, which accounted for 2.19, 3.42, 13.7, and 40.1 % of the corresponding tolerable limits suggested by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives. The THQ values of the four metals were far below 1 for most samples, except for those of Cd and Cr in the four shellfish species with the mean values of 0.132 and 0.385, respectively. The highest THQ values of Cd were observed in the species of oyster (0.719) and mud clam (0.568). But the high THQ values of Cr observed in all the four species were derived from the applied reference dose (RfD) data of Cr(VI) due to the unavailable RfD value of total Cr. The results indicate that the intakes of heavy metals by consuming shellfish collected from Xiamen of China do not present an appreciable hazard risk on human health, but attention should be paid to consuming those with relatively high THQ values, such as oyster, mud clam, and short-necked clam."

Shellfish is regularly tested for concentrations of metals and other contaminants by legal authorities for commercial purposes, but although health officials use total metal as standards of food safety, only a part of the metal accumulated in shellfish is available to be assimilated and to cause toxic effect. In order to elucidate these issues an investigation on cockles inhabiting the Aveiro estuary was conducted. Element levels in sediments and wild Cerastoderma edule from sampling areas with different levels of contamination were measured; total element burden of cockles was related to accessible fraction for assimilation (TAM); element concentrations in wild C. edule were compared to EFSA (European Food Safe Authorities), USFDA (United States Food and Drug Administration) and FSANZ (Food Standards Australia and New Zealand) maximum levels (MLs); and the amount of cockle flesh needed to be consumed to exceed provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) was determined. The present work showed that although sediment metal and metalloid contamination in Aveiro estuary is low the concentration of elements in C. edule does not reflect the contamination of the sediment. Aluminium (Al) and mercury (Hg) were the less and nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) were the most bioaccumulated metals by cockles. Comparison of MLs from international organisations with the concentration of elements in C. edule showed that arsenic (As) and Pb exceeded standard levels. The ingestion of less than 1 kg for As and 1.5 kg for Pb of cockles would result in exceeding the PTWI threshold (0.015 and 0.025 mg kg⁻¹ week⁻¹ respectively) in any of the areas considered in the study. Cd and Al also appear to be limiting elements for human consumption. Indeed, consumption of more than 3.1 kg and 2.1 kg of whole cockle soft part from one of the study areas during a single week would lead to exceedance of the recommended PTWI value for Cd (0.007 mg kg⁻¹ week⁻¹) and Al (7 mg kg⁻¹ week⁻¹) respectively. The health concerns to humans from cockle consumption from Aveiro estuary are discussed."

Clinical disease is associated with diagnostic presence of tdh and/or trh virulence genes and identification of these genes in our preliminary isolates from retail shellfish prompted a year-long surveillance of isolates from a temperate estuary in the north of England. The microbial and environmental analysis of 117 samples of mussels, seawater or sediment showed the presence of V. parahaemolyticus from mussels (100%) at all time-points throughout the year including the colder months although they were only recovered from 94.9% of seawater and 92.3% of sediment samples. Throughout the surveillance, 96 isolates were subjected to specific PCR for virulence genes and none tested positive for either. The common understanding that consuming poorly cooked mussels only represents a risk of infection during summer vacations therefore is challenged. Further investigations with V. parahaemolyticus using RAPD-PCR cluster analysis showed a genetically diverse population. There was no distinct clustering for ""environmental"" or ""clinical"" reference strains although a wide variability and heterogeneity agreed with other reports. Continued surveillance of isolates to allay public health risks are justified since geographical distribution and composition of V. parahaemolyticus varies with Future Ocean warming and the potential of environmental strains to acquire virulence genes from pathogenic isolates. The prospects for intervention by phage-mediated biocontrol to reduce or eradicate V. parahaemolyticus in mussels was also investigated. Bacteriophages isolated from enriched samples collected from the river Humber were assessed for their ability to inhibit the growth of V. parahaemolyticus strains in-vitro and in-vivo (with live mussels). V. parahaemolyticus were significantly reduced in-vitro, by an average of 1 log-2 log units and in-vivo, significant reduction of the organisms in mussels occurred in three replicate experimental tank set ups with a ""phage cocktail"" containing 12 different phages. Our perspective biocontrol study suggests that a cocktail of specific phages targeted against strains of V. parahaemolyticus provides good evidence in an experimental setting of the valuable potential of phage as a decontamination agent in natural or industrial mussel processing (343w)."

We examined mercury levels in three types of fish (tuna, flounder, bluefish) commonly available in New Jersey stores, sampling different regions of the state, in communities with high and low per capita incomes, and in both supermarkets and specialty fish markets. We were interested in species-specific levels of mercury in New Jersey fish and whether these levels were similar to data generated nationally by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA; mainly from 1990 to 1992) on the same types of fish. Such information is critical for providing public health advice. We were also interested in whether mercury levels in three common species of fish differed by region of the state, economic neighborhood, or type of store. We found significant species differences, with tuna having the highest levels and flounder the lowest levels. There were no significant differences in mercury levels as a function of type of store or economic neighborhood. There was only one regional difference: flounder from fish markets along the Jersey shore had higher mercury levels than flounder bought in other markets. We also examined mercury levels in six other commonly available fish and two shellfish from central New Jersey markets. There were significant differences in availability and in mercury levels among fish and shellfish. Both shrimp and scallops had total mercury levels < 0.02 ppm (wet weight). Large shrimp had significantly lower levels of mercury than small shrimp. For tuna, sea bass, croaker, whiting, scallops, and shrimp, the levels of mercury were higher in New Jersey samples than those reported by the FDA. Consumers selecting fish for ease of availability (present in > 50% of markets) would select flounder, snapper, bluefish, and tuna (tuna had the highest mercury value), and those selecting only for price would select whiting, porgy, croaker, and bluefish (all with average mercury levels < 0.3 ppm wet weight). Flounder was the fish with the best relationship among availability, cost, and low mercury levels. We suggest that state agencies responsible for protecting the health of their citizens should obtain information on fish availability in markets and fish preferences of diverse groups of citizens and use this information to select fish for analysis of contaminant levels, providing data on the most commonly eaten fish that will help people make informed decisions about risks from fish consumption."

The United Kingdom (UK) has comprehensive national baseline data on the prevalence, levels, and seasonality of norovirus in oysters in production areas resulting from a previous two-year study (2009-2011). However, previously, data on final product as sold to the consumer have been lacking. As part of a wider project to establish the overall burden of foodborne norovirus in the UK, this study aimed to address this data gap. A one-year survey of oysters collected from the point-of-sale to the consumer was carried out from March 2015 to March 2016. A total of 630 samples, originating in five different European Union Member States, were collected from 21 regions across the UK using a randomised sampling plan, and tested for norovirus using a method compliant with ISO 15216-1, in addition to Escherichia coli as the statutory indicator of hygiene status. As in the previous production area study, norovirus RNA was detected in a high proportion of samples (68.7%), with a strong winter seasonality noted. Some statistically significant differences in prevalences and levels in oysters from different countries were noted, with samples originating in the Netherlands showing lower prevalences and levels than those from either the UK or Ireland. Overall, levels detected in positive samples were considerably lower than seen previously. Investigation of potential contributing factors to this pattern of results was carried out. Application of normalisation factors to the data from the two studies based on both the numbers of norovirus illness reports received by national surveillance systems, and the national average environmental temperatures during the two study periods resulted in a much closer agreement between the two data sets, with the notably different numbers of illness reports making the major contribution to the differences observed in norovirus levels in oysters. The large majority of samples (76.5%) contained no detectable E. coli; however, in a small number of samples (2.4%) levels above the statutory end product standard (230 MPN/100 g) were detected. This study both revealed the high prevalence of norovirus RNA in oysters directly available to the UK consumer, despite the high level of compliance with the existing E. coli-based health standards, while also highlighting the difficulty in comparing the results of surveys carried out in different time periods, due to variability in risk factors."

Outbreaks connected with fish vectors were caused by scombroid, ciguatoxin, bacteria and unknown agents; in shellfish, unknown agents, paralytic shellfish poisoning, Vibrio spp. and other bacteria, followed by hepatitis A virus, were responsible for the outbreaks. At least ten genera of bacterial pathogens have been implicated in seafood-borne diseases. Over the past twenty-five years, bacterial pathogens associated with faecal contamination have represented only 4% of the shellfish-associated outbreaks, while naturally-occurring bacteria accounted for 20% of shellfish-related illnesses and 99% of the deaths. Most of these indigenous bacteria fall into the family Vibrionaceae which includes the genera Vibrio, Aeromonas and Plesiomonas. In general, Vibrio spp. are not associated with faecal contamination and therefore faecal indicators do not correlate with the presence of Vibrio. Viruses are the most significant cause of shellfish-associated disease: in New York State, for example, 33% and 62% of 196 outbreaks between 1981 and 1992 were caused by Norwalk virus and gastrointestinal viruses (small round structured viruses), respectively. In addition, several illnesses are a result of toxic algal blooms, the growth of naturally occurring bacteria and diatoms causing neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning, diarrhoetic shellfish poisoning, amnesic shellfish poisoning and ciguatera. Current estimates place the annual number of ciguatera cases at 20,000 world-wide. Scombroid poisoning is the most significant cause of illness associated with seafood. Scombrotoxin is of bacterial origin and halophilic Vibrio spp. causing high histamine levels are implicated as the source. Scombroid poisoning is geographically diverse and many species have been implicated, namely: tuna, mahi-mahi, bluefish, sardines, mackerel, amberjack and abalone. Temperature abuse has been cited as a major cause of scombroid poisoning. For routine work, the use of faecal indicators to predict the relative level of faecal contamination should not be disposed of. However, the main source of seafood illness is due to species which are not predicted by these organisms. In order to protect public health, routine surveillance using new pathogen-specific techniques such as polymerase chain reaction should be used. This, in combination with risk assessment methods and hazard analysis and critical control points, will begin to address the need for improvement in the safety of seafood."

As they are usually consumed raw or lightly cooked, they are considered to be a possible source of foodborne infections, including giardiosis and cryptosporidiosis. Although data indicating contamination of shellfish with Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts have been published, comparing results from different studies is difficult, as there is no standardized protocol for the detection and quantification of these parasites in mussels, and different researchers have used different analytical approaches. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize the most sensitive protocol for the detection of Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts in shellfish. In an effort to test the sensitivity and the detection limits of the protocol, every step of the process was investigated, from initial preparation of the mussel matrix through detection of the parasites. Comparative studies were conducted, including several methods previously applied by other researchers, on commercial mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis spiked with a known number of (oo)cysts of both parasites. As preparation of the mussel matrix plays an important role in the sensitivity of the method, different techniques were tested. These included: (ia) removal of the coarse particles from the matrix with sieving, (ib) extraction of the lipids with diethyl ether, and (ic) artificial digestion of the matrix with pepsin digestion solution, and (ii) the use or not of immunomagnetic separation (IMS) for the concentration of the (oo)cysts. Pre-treatment of the mussel homogenate with pepsin digestion solution, followed by IMS, then detection with a direct immunofluorescence assay, achieved the highest sensitivity: 32.1% (SD: 21.1) of Giardia cysts and 61.4% (SD: 26.2) Cryptosporidium oocysts were recovered, with a detection limit of 10 (oo)cysts per g of mussel homogenate. The outcome of the current study was the standardization of a protocol, with defined detection limits, for the detection of these two protozoan transmission stages in mussels, in order to be used as a reference technique in future studies. Further advantages of this protocol are that it uses the whole mussel as a starting material and does not require difficult handling procedures. The method has potential to be applied in larger surveys and, potentially, to other species of shellfish for the detection of these parasites. However, the composition (lipid to protein ratio) may be of relevance for detection efficiency for some other species of shellfish."

Filter feeding activity and toxin uptake by the mussels were followed by cell counting and toxin analysis in water samples taken before and after each daily water renewal. The accumulation and depuration of PST as well as the anatomical distribution of toxins were monitored throughout the experiment by HPLC analysis of mussel extracts. Mussels fed the toxic cyanobacterium removed on average 65.3% of cells and 40.36% of total PST daily provided. Daily rates of cell clearance (% of initial) were negatively correlated with the amounts of PST daily provided (but not with the amount of cells). This suggests a negative effect of toxins on the feeding behaviour of mussels. Small amounts of toxins could be detected in the mussels after the second day of exposure, reaching a maximum of 26 microg PST100 g(-1) by day 7. The viscera contained the greatest proportion of toxins (78%) at the start of the toxification. However, increasing amounts of PST were found in the remaining tissues (gills, mantle and foot) over time. Toxins detected in the mussel extracts were the same provided in the dietary A. issatschenkoi. Nevertheless, mussels showed a higher proportion of saxitoxin and decarbomoylsaxitoxin and a lower proportion of gonyautoxin-5 than the fed cyanobacterium. Similar depuration efficiencies were observed among starved individuals (6.9% day(-1)) and those fed with A. falcatus (8.2% day(-1)) indicating that both treatments had comparable effects on toxin metabolism. Mussels showed a typical S shaped depuration kinetics curve consisting of a first short period of slow toxin decay followed by a rapid loss and a subsequent slower release of toxins. Trace to undetectable levels of PST were found in mussels after the 14-day depurating period. Although freshwater mussels are not widely consumed by humans, their capacity to accumulate PST points to the risk of PST propagation through the food chain of freshwater ecosystems via filter-feeding mussels."

However, valid use of a given standard or guideline requires an understanding of its technical basis and underlying assumptions. Each type of standard or guideline is specific for one sampling medium (water, bed sediment, and fish and shellfish tissue) and is aimed at protection of one or more beneficial uses of the hydrologic system (drinking water, fish and shellfish consumption, aquatic organisms, and wildlife). These characteristics can be used to identify which standards and guidelines are appropriate for comparison with measured pesticide concentrations in environmental samples from a given hydrologic system. A review of standards and guidelines can be restricted to the applicable sampling medium. Then, the beneficial uses of the hydrologic system need to be identified and the measured pesticide concentrations compared with standards and guidelines for all beneficial uses that apply to that system. Several key factors that must be considered when applying this general process to water-quality assessment are summarized below. Two precautions need to be considered regarding sampling media: 1. Standards and guidelines for water distinguish between finished drinking water (potable water, often treated) and ambient surface water. If standards and guidelines for drinking water (EPA primary drinking-water regulations and drinking-water health advisories) are applied to measured pesticide concentrations in ambient water samples, the effects of water treatment (such as filtration) need to be considered. 2. Standards and guidelines for fish and shellfish tissue distinguish between edible fish and shellfish tissue and whole fish tissue. Comparison of pesticide concentrations in whole fish tissue with standards or guidelines for edible fish and shellfish tissue is appropriate only as a screening procedure to determine whether additional sampling and analysis for contaminants in edible fish fillets are warranted. For some sampling media (water, fish and shellfish tissues), both standards and guidelines may exist for a given pesticide. Standards and guidelines may differ in their technical bases and in the implications or consequences of finding measured concentrations in exceedance of the standard or guideline value. Therefore, comparison of measured pesticide concentrations with both standards and guidelines is useful because each provides different information about the hydrologic system.

Foodborne infections are mainly associated with the consumption of contaminated raw or undercooked fish and shellfish. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial resistance, virulence factors, and genetic profiles of V. parahaemolyticus isolates from seafood originating from different countries. A total of 104 (17.5%) isolates were recovered from 595 analyzed samples. The isolates were tested for the presence of the tdh and trh genes, involved in the pathogenesis of V. parahaemolyticus infections in humans, and these genes were detected in 3 (2.9%) and 11 (10.6%) isolates, respectively. The trh-positive isolates also possessed the ure gene, which is responsible for urease production. Moreover, the activity of protease A was identified in all V. parahaemolyticus strains. Antimicrobial resistance revealed that most isolates were resistant to ampicillin (75.0%) and streptomycin (68.3%), whereas all strains were sensitive to chloramphenicol and tetracyclines. Most of the isolates (55.8%) showed resistance against two classes of antimicrobials, mainly to ampicillin and streptomycin (46.2%). Only one isolate displayed a multiresistant pattern. Genotypic analysis of V. parahaemolyticus revealed a high degree of diversity among the isolates tested. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method distinguished 73 clonal groups, and the most numerous group consisted of 7 strains.

{'food':","Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are the main cause of shellfish-borne gastroenteritis outbreaks. In the absence of routine technical approaches allowing infectious particles to be detected, this viral pathogen is currently targeted by genome research, leading to difficult interpretations. In this study, we investigated the potential of F-specific RNA bacteriophages (FRNAPH) as fecal and viral contamination indicators in shellfish and water from a local harvesting area. FRNAPH were also used as microbial source tracking tools. Constraints imposed by detection limits are illustrated here by the detection of infectious FRNAPH in several samples in the absence of FRNAPH genomes. The opposite situation was also observed, likely explained by the persistence of the genomes being greater than infectivity. Similar considerations may be applied to HuNoVs, suggesting that HuNoV genome targeting is of limited relevance in assessing infectious risks. While FRNAPH did not provide any benefits compared to Escherichia coli as fecal pollution indicators in water, novel observations were made in shellfish: contrary to E. coli, a seasonal trend of infectious FRNAPH concentrations was observed. These concentrations were higher than those found in water, confirming bioaccumulation in shellfish. This study also underlines a relationship between the presence of HuNoV genomes and those of human-specific FRNAPH subgroup II (FRNAPH-II) in shellfish collected throughout Europe. Further research should be undertaken to evaluate FRNAPH potential as an indicator of the presence of infectious HuNoVs. To this end, shellfish involved in HuNoV-caused gastroenteritis outbreaks should be analyzed for the presence of infectious FRNAPH-II. This work provides new data about the use of F-specific RNA phages (FRNAPH) as a tool for evaluating fecal or viral contamination, especially in shellfish. In our case study, FRNAPH did not provide any benefits compared to E. coli as fecal pollution indicators in water but were found to be very useful in shellfish. Their concentrations in shellfish were higher than those found in the surrounding water, confirming bioaccumulation. This study also underlines a relationship between the presence of human norovirus genomes (HuNoVs) and those of FRNAPH subgroup II (FRNAPH-II). Considering that the two virus types have similar behaviors and since FRNAPH infectivity can be investigated, the specific detection of infectious FRNAPH-II could be regarded as an indication of the presence of infectious HuNoVs. The contribution of infectious human FRNAPH targeting for assessing the viral risk associated with HuNoVs in shellfish should thus be investigated."

Concentrations of copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), and manganese (Mn) were measured in R. decussatus. Water and sediment samples were collected at two stations of Timsah Lake in Ismailia, Egypt, from October to November 2002, using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). Results from the heavy-metal and microbial analyses indicated that site II was less contaminated than site I. The bivalve showed accumulation of metals, with a bioaccumulation factor (BAF) greater than 4. The bioaccumulation of metals varied strongly according to the sampling site. After 48 h of depuration, Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, and Mn were reduced significantly, to 46.8% and 47.7%, 19.9% and 20.3%, 27.3% and 27.9%, 35.9% and 36.6%, and 18.2% and 26.6%, compared with the initial concentrations, in clam tissue at the two stations. In bivalves from site II the counts of total bacteria, fecal coliforms, and bacterial pathogens were reduced by more than 90%, whereas phage counts were only reduced by 56% after 4 days of depuration. The depuration of bivalves collected from the heavily polluted site (I) was not effective, as coliforms were reduced only by 85% after 4 days, whereas counts of pathogens and pathogenic indicators such as Vibrio, fecal Streptococcus, and coliphage decreased to less than 50% of the initial concentration. The time necessary to decrease contamination to 10%, 50%, and 90% for clams at both stations was consistently shorter for heavy metals than for microorganisms. Investigation of the effects of heavy-metal and microbiological depuration on valve movement and physiological rates (oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion) was carried out on R. decussatus to test the utility of physiological stress indices in assessing the health of depurated animals. Clams in the experimental tanks exhibited various states of activity, which were rated by identifying and scoring (0-4) the different parameters, including shell gap, siphon extension, and foot protrusion. Moreover, an increase in ammonia excretion was usually associated with an increase in respiration rate. The oxygen-to-nitrogen ratio provided a sensitive indicator of bivalve health. It can be concluded that shellfish monitoring and depuration data depended on the initial concentration of the pollutants. There were differences in the physiological responses of clams from the two sites during the periods of pre- and postdepuration of the contaminants. There was a significant correlation between reduction of metal concentration in clam tissue and enhancement of valve movement, as well as activity and increasing respiration rate."

{'Norovirus (NoV)': ['F-specific RNA bacteriophages (FRNAPH)', 'FRNAPH subgroup II']}</s>","Norovirus (NoV) is the leading cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks linked to oyster consumption. In this study, we investigated the potential of F-specific RNA bacteriophages (FRNAPH) as indicators of viral contamination in oysters by focusing especially on FRNAPH subgroup II (FRNAPH-II). These viral indicators have been neglected because their behavior is sometimes different from that of NoV in shellfish, especially during the depuration processes usually performed before marketing. However, a significant bias needs to be taken into account. This bias is that, in the absence of routine culture methods, NoV is targeted by genome detection, while the presence of FRNAPH is usually investigated by isolation of infectious particles. In this study, by targeting both viruses using genome detection, a significant correlation between the presence of FRNAPH-II and that of NoV in shellfish collected from various European harvesting areas impacted by fecal pollution was observed. Moreover, during their depuration, while the long period of persistence of NoV was confirmed, a similar or even longer period of persistence of the FRNAPH-II genome, which was over 30 days, was observed. Such a striking genome persistence calls into question the relevance of molecular methods for assessing viral hazards. Targeting the same virus (i. e. , FRNAPH-II) by culture and genome detection in specimens from harvesting areas as well as during depuration, we concluded that the presence of genomes in shellfish does not provide any information on the presence of the corresponding infectious particles. In view of these results, infectious FRNAPH detection should be reconsidered as a valuable indicator in oysters, and its potential for use in assessing viral hazard needs to be investigated. IMPORTANCE This work brings new data about the behavior of viruses in shellfish, as well as about the relevance of molecular methods for their detection and evaluation of the viral hazard. First, a strong correlation between the presence of F-specific RNA bacteriophages of subgroup II (FRNAPH-II) and that of norovirus (NoV) in shellfish impacted by fecal contamination has been observed when both viruses are detected using molecular approaches. Second, when reverse transcription-PCR and culture are used to detect FRNAPH-II in shellfish, it appears that the genomes of the viruses present a longer period of persistence than infectious virus, and thus, virus genome detection fails to give information about the concomitant presence of infectious viruses. Finally, this study shows that FRNAPH persist at least as long as NoV does. These data are major arguments to reconsider the potential of FRNAPH as indicators of shellfish viral quality."

Likewise, the understanding of the environmental conditions triggering shellfish mortalities and successful strategies for their mitigation are incomplete. In the literature, phytoplankton have played only a cursory role in summer shellfish mortalities in Washington State because spawning stress and bacteria were thought to be the primary causes. In recent years, the occurrence of Protoceratium reticulatum (Claparede & Lachmann) Buetschli and Akashiwo sanguinea (Hirasaka) Hansen & Moestrup, have been documented by the SoundToxins research and monitoring partnership in increasing numbers and duration and have been associated with declining shellfish health or mortality at various sites in Puget Sound. Blooms of these species occur primarily in summer months and have been shown to cause mass mortalities of shellfish in the U. S. and other parts of the world. In 2016-2017, yessotoxins (YTX) were measured in several species of Puget Sound bivalve shellfish, with a maximum concentration of 2.20 mg/kg in blue mussels, a value below the regulatory limit of 3.75 mg/kg established by the European Union for human health protection but documented to cause shellfish mortalities in other locations around the world. In July 2019, a bloom of P. reticulatum coincided with a summer shellfish mortality event, involving a dramatic surfacing of stressed, gaping Manila clams, suggesting that YTX could be the cause. YTX concentrations in their tissues were measured at a maximum of 0.28 mg/kg and histology of these clams demonstrated damage to digestive glands. A culture of P. reticulatum, isolated from North Bay during this massive bloom and shellfish mortality event, showed YTX reaching 26.6 pg/cell, the highest recorded toxin quota measured in the U. S. to date. Concentrations of YTX in phytoplankton samples reached a maximum of 920 ng/L during a P. reticulatum bloom in Mystery Bay on 13 August 2019 when cell abundance reached 1.82 million cells/L. The highest cellular YTX quota during that bloom that lasted into September was 10.8 pg/cell on 3 Sept 2019. Shellfish producers in Washington State have also noted shellfish larvae mortalities due to A. sanguinea passing through filtration intake systems into hatchery facilities. Early warning of shellfish-killing harmful algal bloom (HAB) presence in Puget Sound, through partnerships such as SoundToxins, provides options for shellfish growers to mitigate their effects through early harvest, movement of shellstock to upland facilities, or enhanced filtration at aquaculture facilities."

Eighty-four potentially toxic species have been detected in the MS (2,350 records), of which 16 described from these waters between 1860 and 2014 and a few suspected to have been introduced. More than half of these species (46) produce toxins that may affect human health, the remainders ichthyotoxic substances (29) or other types of toxins (9). Nevertheless, toxicity-related events are not frequent in the MS (308 records in 31 years), and mainly consist of impacts on aquaculture, caused by the dinoflagellates Dinophysis and Alexandrium, along with a few actual shellfish poisoning cases. Pseudo-nitzschia blooms are widespread, but domoic acid in shellfish rarely exceeds regulatory levels. Fish kills are probably less sporadic than reported, representing a problem at a few places along the southern MS coasts and in the Ebro River Delta. Since the last decade of the 20th century, blooms of the benthic dinoflagellates Ostreopsis cf. ovata have regularly occurred all along rocky shores of the MS, at times with human health problems caused by toxic aerosol. New records of Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa, until now reported for the westernmost and easternmost MS coasts, raise concerns about the risk of ciguatera, a syndrome so far known only for subtropical and tropical areas. Recent discoveries are the dinoflagellates Vulcanodinium rugosum, responsible for the presence of pinnatoxins in French lagoons' shellfish, and the azaspiracid-producers Azadinium spp. Mucilages and discolorations have a major impact on tourism in summer. Reports of toxic species and HABs have apparently increased in the MS over the last half century, which is likely related to the increased awareness and monitoring operations rather than to an actual increase of these phenomena. Indeed, while the case of Ostreopsis appears as a sudden upsurge rather than a trend, no actual increase of toxic or noxious events has so far emerged in intensively studied areas, such as the French and Spanish coasts or the Adriatic Sea. Moreover, some cases of decrease are reported, e. g. , for Alexandrium minutum blooms disappearing from the Harbour of Alexandria. Overall, main HAB risks derive from cases of massive development of microalgal biomass and consequent impacts of reduced coastal water quality on tourism, which represents the largest part of the marine economy along the MS coasts."

Exposure of estuarine fin fish and shellfish to toxic levels of pesticides may occur, resulting in significant declines in field populations. Integrated pest management (IPM), best management practices (BMP), and retention ponds (RP) are risk management tools that have been proposed to reduce the contaminant risk from agricultural NPS runoff into estuarine ecosystems. Field studies were conducted at three sites within coastal estuarine ecosystems of South Carolina (SC) from 1985 to 1990 that varied in terms of the amount and degree of risk reduction strategies employed. An intensively managed (IPM, BMP, and RP) agricultural treatment site (TRT) was studied for pesticide runoff impacts. From 1985 to 1987, there were minimal (some IPM and BMP) management activities at TRT, but from 1988 to 1990, TRT was managed using an intensive risk reduction strategy. A second unmanaged agricultural growing area, Kiawah (KWA), was also studied and compared with TRT in terms of pesticide runoff and the resulting impacts on grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) and mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus). A third, non-agricultural, reference site (CTL) was used for comparing results from the managed and unmanaged agricultural sites. In situ toxicity tests and field samples of the grass shrimp populations were conducted at each site and compared in terms of survival and the effectiveness of current risk reduction strategies. Significant runoff of insecticides (azinphosmethyl, endosulfan, and fenvalerate) along with several fish kills were observed at TRT prior to the implementation of rigorous risk reduction methods. A significant reduction of in stream pesticide concentrations (up to 90%) was observed at TRT following the implementation of strict NPS runoff controls, which greatly reduced impacts on estuarine fish and shellfish. At the unmanaged KWA, continued impacts due to the runoff of these insecticides were observed, along with several fish kills. Additional monitoring indicated that gravid female grass shrimp populations from KWA had elevated levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a multidrug resistance protein, which may transport various pesticides across cellular membranes. Comparison of field results with laboratory toxicity tests established that pesticide exposure was the primary cause of observed field impacts at each site. These findings clearly indicate the value of an integrated risk reduction strategy (BMP, IPM, and RP) for minimizing impacts from NPS agricultural pesticide runoff."

Methods for quantification of norovirus in oysters using the quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) are well established, and various studies using RT-qPCR have detected norovirus in a considerable proportion of oyster samples, both in the UK and elsewhere. However, RT-qPCR detects viral genome, and by its nature is unable to discriminate between positive results caused by infectious viruses and those caused by non-infectious remnants including damaged virus particles and naked RNA. As a result, a number of alternative or complementary approaches to RT-qPCR testing have been proposed, including the use of infectious viral indicator organisms, most frequently F-specific RNA bacteriophage (F-RNA phage). In this study, we investigated the relationships between F-RNA phage and norovirus in digestive tissues from two sets of oyster samples, one randomly collected at retail (630 samples), and one linked to suspected norovirus illness outbreaks (nine samples). A positive association and correlation between PCR-detectable levels of genogroup II F-RNA bacteriophage (associated with human faecal contamination) and norovirus was found in both sets of samples, with more samples positive for genogroup II phage, at generally higher levels than norovirus. Levels of both viruses were higher in outbreak-related than retail samples. Infectious F-RNA phage was detected in 47.8% of all retail samples, and for a subset of 224 samples where characterisation of phage was carried out, infectious GII phage was detected in 30.4%. Infectious GII phage was detected in all outbreak-related samples. Determination of infectivity ratios by comparing levels of PCR-detectable (copies/g) and infectious GII phage (pfu/g) revealed that in the majority of cases less than 10% of virus detected by RT-qPCR was infectious. Application of these ratios to estimate infectious norovirus levels indicated that while 77.8% of outbreak-related samples contained > 5 estimated infectious norovirus/g, only 13.7% of retail samples did. Use of a combination of levels of PCR-detectable norovirus and infectious F-RNA phage showed that while only 7.0% of retail samples contained both > 100 copies/g norovirus and > 10 pfu/g F-RNA phage, these combined levels were present in 77.8% of outbreak-related samples, and 75.9% of retail samples with > 5 estimated infectious norovirus/g. We therefore suggest that combining RT-qPCR testing with a test for infectious F-RNA phage has the potential to better estimate health risks, and to better predict the presence of infectious norovirus than RT-qPCR testing alone."

Among various kinds of cultivated organisms many marine and freshwater finfish and shellfish species constitute an important industry with their production increasing every year. Recently due to intensive farming practices infectious diseases pose a major problem in aquaculture industry, causing heavy loss to farmers. A number of approaches have been made to control diseases including sanitary prophylaxis, disinfection, and chemotherapy with particular emphasis on the use of antibiotics. However, the application of antibiotics and chemicals in culture is often expensive and undesirable since it leads to antibiotic and chemical resistance and consumer reluctance. Therefore immunostimulants such as glucan, chitin, lactoferrin, levamisole, and some medicinal plant extracts or products have been used to control fish and shellfish diseases. In this regard the medicinal plant extracts and their products act as immunostimulants modulating the immune response to prevent and control fish and shellfish diseases. The immunostimulants mainly facilitate the function of phagocytic cells, increase their bactericidal activities, and stimulate the natural killer cells, complement, lysozyme activity, and antibody responses in fish and shellfish which confer enhanced protection from infectious diseases. Currently increased consumer demand for perfection in fish and shellfish farms has put new dimensions to the quality, safety, elimination of concomitant pollutants, antibiotics, and carcinogens during the production process. In this context plants or their byproducts are preferred since they contain several phenolic, polyphenolic, alkaloid, quinone, terpenoid, lectine, and polypeptide compounds many of which have been shown to be very effective alternatives to antibiotics, chemicals, vaccines, and other synthetic compounds. In aquaculture the herbal medicines are also known to exhibit anti-microbial activity, facilitate growth, and maturation of cultured species; besides under intensive farming the anti-stress characteristics of herbs will be of immense use without posing any environmental hazard. Administration of herbal extracts or their products at various concentrations through oral (diet) or injection route enhance the innate and adaptive immune response of different freshwater and marine fish and shellfish against bacterial, viral, and parasitic diseases. Even an overdose of immunostimulants may induce immunosuppression without side effects but helps to reduce the losses caused by disease in aquaculture. The present review describes the role of medicinal herbs and their products on innate and adaptive immune response of finfish and shellfish."

E. coli were isolated from 180 samples of raw meat, poultry and shellfish and also isolated from 43 chicken faeces samples. Ninety-nine E. coli isolates recovered from all sources were selected for the investigation of their susceptibility to 15 antimicrobial agents by the disk diffusion method. Eighty-four percent of the isolates were resistant to one or more antibiotics, and multi-resistance, defined as resistance to at least 3 different classes of antibiotics, was detected in all sources. The rates of multi-resistance were up to 89.5% in chicken, 95% in chicken faeces and 75% in pork isolates. Resistance was most frequently observed to tetracycline (77.8%), sulfafurazole (60.6%), ampicillin (50.5%), amoxicillin (50.5%), trimethoprim (51.5%), chloramphenicol (43.4%), streptomycin (39.4%), nalidixic acid (34.3%) and gentamicin (24.2%). In addition, the isolates also displayed resistance to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin 16.2%, norfloxacin 17.2%, and enrofloxacin 21.2%), with chicken isolates showing the highest rates of resistance to these antibiotics (52.6-63.2%). Thirty-eight multi-resistant isolates were selected for further the examination of antibiotic resistance genes and were also evaluated for virulence gene profiles by multiplex and uniplex polymerase chain reaction. The beta-lactam TEM gene and tetracycline resistance tetA, tetB genes were frequently detected in the tested isolates (84.2% and 89.5% respectively). Genes which are responsible for resistance to streptomycin (aadA) (68.4%), chloramphenicol (cmlA) (42.1%), sulfonamides (sulI) (39.5%), trimethoprim (dhfrV) (26.3%) and kanamycin (aphA-1) (23.7%) were also widely distributed. Plasmid-mediated ampC genes were detected in E. coli isolates from chicken and pork. The isolates were tested for the presence of 58 virulence genes for adhesins, toxins, capsule synthesis, siderophores, invasins and others from different E. coli pathotypes. All of the tested isolates contained at least one virulence gene and there were 16 genes detected. Virulence genes detected were fimH (92.1%), bmaE (84.2%), TSPE4. C2 (42.1%), aidA AIDA-I (orfB) (31.6%), east1 (26.3%), traT (23.7%), and others including fyuA, iutA, chuA, yjaA, iss, iroN(E. coli), ibeA, aah (orfA), iha and papG allele III (10.5-2.6%). Typical toxin genes produced by enterohemorrhagic and enterotoxigenic E. coli pathotypes (a heat-stable toxin (ST), heat-labile toxin (LT) and Shiga toxin stx1, stx2) were not detected in any of these 38 isolates. The study has revealed that E. coli in raw foods is a significant reservoir of resistance and virulence genes."

The liver is the primary detoxification organ in animals, and its pro- and anti-inflammatory responses are important functions in the detoxification of toxins. Therefore, we investigated the response of these inflammatory factors to aphantoxins in the liver of zebrafish (Danio rerio). A. flosaquae DC-1 was sampled during blooms in Dianchi Lake, China and cultured, and the toxin was extracted and analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography. The primary constituents were gonyautoxins 1 (34.04%) and 5 (21.28%) and neosaxitoxin (12.77%). Zebrafish were injected intraperitoneally with 5.3 μg (low dose) or 7.61 μg (high dose) of saxitoxin equivalents [equivalents (eq. )]/kg body weight of A. flosaquae DC-1 aphantoxins. Hyperemia, the hepatosomatic index (HSI), and physiological and molecular responses of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the zebrafish liver were investigated at different time points 1-24 h post-exposure. Aphantoxins significantly enhanced hepatic hyperemia and altered the HSI 3-24 h post-exposure, suggesting that inflammation caused morphological changes. Subsequent investigations using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and IL-8 and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor β were higher in the liver of zebrafish exposed to aphantoxins, which indicated physiological inflammatory responses. Further analysis by real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated upregulated mRNA expression of these cytokines, suggesting molecular inflammatory responses in the zebrafish liver. These changes showed dose- and time-dependent patterns. These results indicated that aphantoxins induced hyperemia and altered the HSI, and subsequently increased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 to induce physiological inflammatory responses. These changes activated the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β to suppress inflammatory damage. The induced changes were the result of upregulated mRNA expression of these inflammatory cytokines caused by aphantoxins. Aphantoxins resulted in hepatic immunotoxicity and response by inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Zebrafish liver in turn suppressed the inflammatory damage by upregulating the activities of anti-inflammatory cytokines. In the future, these pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the zebrafish liver may be prove to be useful biomarkers of aphantoxins and blooms in nature."

Huichas Island (Aysén) has an history of HABs spanning more than 30 years, but there is limited investigation of the bioaccumulation of marine toxins in the bivalves and gastropods from the Region of Aysén. In this study, bivalves (Mytilus chilenses, Choromytilus chorus, Aulacomya ater, Gari solida, Tagelus dombeii and Venus antiqua) and carnivorous gastropods (Argobuccinum ranelliformes and Concholepas concholepas) were collected from 28 sites. Researchers analysed the accumulation of STX-group toxins using a LC with a derivatisation post column (LC-PCOX), while lipophilic toxins (OA-group, azapiracids, pectenotoxins and yessotoxins) were analysed using LC-MS/MS with electrospray ionisation (+/-) in visceral (hepatopancreas) and non-visceral tissues (mantle, adductor muscle, gills and foot). Levels of STX-group and OA-group toxins varied among individuals from the same site. Among all tissue samples, the highest concentrations of STX-group toxins were noted in the hepatopancreas in V. antiqua (95 ± 0.1 μg STX-eq 100 g(-1)), T. dombeii (148 ± 1.4 μg STX-eq 100 g(-1)) and G. solida (3232 ± 5.2 μg STX-eq 100 g(-1); p < 0.05); in the adductor muscle in M. chilensis (2495 ± 6.4 μg STX-eq 100 g(-1); p < 0.05) and in the foot in C. concholepas (81 ± 0.7 μg STX-eq 100 g(-1)) and T. dombeii (114 ± 1.2 μg STX-eq 100 g(-1)). The highest variability of toxins was detected in G. solida, where high levels of carbamate derivatives were identified (GTXs, neoSTX and STX). In addition to the detected hydrophilic toxins, OA-group toxins were detected (OA and DTX-1) with an average ratio of ≈1:1. The highest levels of OA-group toxins were in the foot of C. concholepas, with levels of 400.3 ± 3.6 μg OA eq kg(-1) (p < 0.05) and with a toxic profile composed of 90% OA. A wide range of OA-group toxins was detected in M. chilensis with a toxicity < 80 μg OA eq kg(-1), but with 74% of those toxins detected in the adductor muscle. In all evaluated species, there was no detection of lipophilic toxins associated with biotransformation in molluscs and carnivorous gastropods. In addition, the STX-group and OA-group toxin concentrations in shellfish was not associated with the presence of HAB. The ranking of toxin concentration in the tissues of most species was: digestive glands > mantle > adductor muscle for the STX-group toxins and foot > digestive gland for the OA-group toxins. These results gave a better understanding of the variability and compartmentalisation of STX-group and OA-group toxins in different bivalve and gastropod species from the south of Chile, and the analyses determined that tissues could play an important role in the biotransformation of STX-group toxins and the retention of OA-group toxins."

This study aimed to estimate the impact of climate change effects on mycotoxin contamination of cereal grains cultivated in the terrestrial area of north west Europe, and on the frequency of harmful algal blooms and contamination of shellfish with marine biotoxins in the North Sea coastal zone. The study focused on contamination of wheat with deoxynivalenol, and on abundance of Dinophysis spp. and the possible relationship with diarrhetic shellfish toxins. The study used currently available data and models. Global and regional climate models were combined with models of crop phenology, mycotoxin prediction models, hydrodynamic models and ecological models, with the output of one model being used as input for the other. In addition, statistical data analyses using existing national datasets from the study area were performed to obtain information on the relationships between Dinophysis spp. cell counts and contamination of shellfish with diarrhetic shellfish toxins as well as on frequency of cereal cropping. In this paper, a summary of the study is presented, and overall conclusions and recommendations are given. Climate change projections for the years 2031-2050 were used as the starting point of the analyses relative to a preceding 20-year baseline period from which the climate change signal was calculated. Results showed that, in general, climate change effects lead to advanced flowering and harvest of wheat, and increased risk of contamination of wheat with deoxynivalenol. Blooms of dinoflagellates were estimated to occur more often. If the group of Dinophysis spp. behaves similarly to other flagellates in the future then frequency of harmful algal blooms of Dinophysis spp. may also increase, but consequences for contamination of shellfish with diarrhetic shellfish toxins are uncertain. Climate change will also have indirect effects on toxin contamination, which may be equally important. For example, the frequency of cropping of wheat and maize in north Europe was projected to increase under climate change, which will also increase the risk of contamination of the grains with deoxynivalenol. Risk managers are encouraged to consider the entire range of the predictions of climate change effects on food safety hazards, rather than median or average values only. Furthermore, it is recommended to closely monitor levels of mycotoxins and marine biotoxins in the future, in particular related to risky situations associated with favourable climatic conditions for toxin producing organisms. In particular, it is important to pay attention to the continuity of collecting the right data, and the availability and accessibility of databases. On a European level, it is important to stress the need for harmonisation of terminology and data collection."

            Dictionary: None</s>",{'Bivalves': ['Harmful algae']}</s>,"Bivalves were long thought to be ""symptomless carriers"" of marine microalgal toxins to human seafood consumers. In the past three decades, science has come to recognize that harmful algae and their toxins can be harmful to grazers, including bivalves. Indeed, studies have shown conclusively that some microalgal toxins function as active grazing deterrents. When responding to marine Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) events, bivalves can reject toxic cells to minimize toxin and bioactive extracellular compound (BEC) exposure, or ingest and digest cells, incorporating nutritional components and toxins. Several studies have reported modulation of bivalve hemocyte variables in response to HAB exposure. Hemocytes are specialized cells involved in many functions in bivalves, particularly in immunological defense mechanisms. Hemocytes protect tissues by engulfing or encapsulating living pathogens and repair tissue damage caused by injury, poisoning, and infections through inflammatory processes. The effects of HAB exposure observed on bivalve cellular immune variables have raised the question of possible effects on susceptibility to infectious disease. As science has described a previously unrecognized diversity in microalgal bioactive substances, and also found a growing list of infectious diseases in bivalves, episodic reports of interactions between harmful algae and disease in bivalves have been published. Only recently, studies directed to understand the physiological and metabolic bases of these interactions have been undertaken. This review compiles evidence from studies of harmful algal effects upon bivalve shellfish that establishes a framework for recent efforts to understand how harmful algae can alter infectious disease, and particularly the fundamental role of cellular immunity, in modulating these interactions. Experimental studies reviewed here indicate that HABs can modulate bivalve-pathogen interactions in various ways, either by increasing bivalve susceptibility to disease or conversely by lessening infection proliferation or transmission. Alteration of immune defense and global physiological distress caused by HAB exposure have been the most frequent reasons identified for these effects on disease. Only few studies, however, have addressed these effects so far and a general pattern cannot be established. Other mechanisms are likely involved but are under-studied thus far and will need more attention in the future. In particular, the inhibition of bivalve filtration by HABs and direct interaction between HABs and infectious agents in the seawater likely interfere with pathogen transmission. The study of these interactions in the field and at the population level also are needed to establish the ecological and economical significance of the effects of HABs upon bivalve diseases. A more thorough understanding of these interactions will assist in development of more effective management of bivalve shellfisheries and aquaculture in oceans subjected to increasing HAB and disease pressures."

In particular, Dinophysis acuminata has been reported as the major DSP agent in Western Europe. Still, its contribution to DSP events in the regions of the English Channel and the Atlantic coast of France, and the role of the others species of the Dinophysis community in these areas are not as clear. In addition, species identification within the D. acuminata complex has proven difficult due to their highly similar morphological features. In the present study, 30 clonal strains of the dominant Dinophysis species have been isolated from French coasts including the English Channel (3 sites), the Atlantic Ocean (11 sites) and the Mediterranean Sea (6 sites). Morphologically, strains were identified as three species: D. acuta, D. caudata, D. tripos, as well as the D. acuminata-complex. Sequences of the ITS and LSU rDNA regions confirmed these identifications and revealed no genetic difference within the D. acuminata-complex. Using the mitochondrial gene cox1, two groups of strains differing by only one substitution were found in the D. acuminata-complex, but SEM analysis of various strains showed a large range of morphological variations. Based on geographical origin and morphology, strains of the subclade A were ascribed to 'D. acuminata' while those of the subclade B were ascribed to 'D. sacculus'. Nevertheless, the distinction into two separate species remains questionable and was not supported by our genetic data. The considerable variations observed in cultured strains suggest that physiological factors might influence cell contour and bias identification. Analyses of Dinophysis cultures from French coastal waters using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed species-conserved toxin profiles for D. acuta (dinophysistoxin 2 (DTX2), okadaic acid (OA), pectenotoxin 2 (PTX2)), D. caudata (PTX2) and D. tripos (PTX2), irrespective of geographical origin (Atlantic Ocean or Mediterranean Sea). Within the D. acuminata-complex, two different toxin profiles were observed: the strains of 'D. acuminata' (subclade A) from the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean contained only OA while strains of 'D. sacculus' (subclade B) from Mediterranean Sea/Atlantic Ocean contained PTX2 as the dominant toxin, with OA and C9-esters also being present, albeit in lower proportions. The same difference in toxin profiles between 'D. sacculus' and 'D. acuminata' was reported in several studies from Galicia (NW- Spain). This difference in toxin profiles has consequences in terms of public health, and consequently for monitoring programs. While toxin profile could appear as a reliable feature separating 'D. acuminata' from 'D. sacculus' on both French and Spanish coasts, this does not seem consistent with observations on a broader geographical scale for the D. acuminata complex, possibly due to the frequent lack of genetic characterization."

Profound differences in the toxicokinetics of DA have been identified in a wide variety of shellfish. We characterized the toxicokinetics of DA in Dungeness crabs (Metacarcinus magister) after oral and intravascular dosing (IV) using a variety of doses ranging from 0.1 to 20mg/kg. After a 1mg/kg oral dose, DA disappeared from the foregut within 2h and largely accumulated in the hepatopancreas, with hemolymph and other tissues having 100-1000 times lower concentrations. After IV dosing, hemolymph concentrations of DA were unexpectedly high and toxicokinetic analysis indicated the steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) was 123-197 ml/kg, which is well below the hemolymph volume of 350 ml/kg for crabs. This indicated only limited extravascular distribution of DA was occurring after IV injection, which is surprising considering the capacity of the hepatopancreas to sequester DA after oral dosing. Additional studies measured the partitioning of DA in hepatopancreas cellular and subcellular fractions. The subcellular distribution of DA was primarily associated with the S8 fraction and could be filtered through a 30,000 MW cut-off filter, indicating DA was not appreciably bound to macromolecules. Interestingly, very little (<0.4%) of the total hepatopancreas DA tissue content was associated with the cellular fraction isolated after dissociation and separation from tissue fragments. The in vivo and in vitro results led us to hypothesize that DA uptake and distribution is regulated by crustacean orthologs of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) type transporters. We tested this hypothesis by co-exposing crabs to DA and known inhibitors of ABC transporters (verapamil, cyclosporine A and MK-571) and through in vitro studies using isolated hepatopancreas tissue and mixed cell suspensions prepared from hepatopancreas tissue. The in vivo results were inconclusive in that the toxicokinetics of DA was not consistently altered by co-administration of the inhibitors. Two exceptions were MK-571, which significantly increased the total body clearance of DA and co-administration of verapamil, which significantly increased the hepatopancreas tissue content of DA 24h after IV injection. Isolated pieces of hepatopancreas tissue were able to readily absorb DA from incubation media, but mixed cell suspensions did not. The absorption of DA or lack thereof was largely unaffected by co-incubation with verapamil although cell suspensions appeared to accumulate small quantities of DA in the presence of verapamil. Collectively, the results of this study suggest DA accumulates in the extracellular spaces of the hepatopancreas, such as the tubular lumen. Under natural circumstances, crabs feeding on contaminated shellfish would be expected to readily absorb DA, which is then stored and slowly eliminated in urine. If the DA exposure level exceeds the storage capacity of the tissue (as occurred with the 20mg/kg dose), breakthrough occurs resulting in much higher systemic exposure and potential for DA toxicity."

Infections originating from relatively cool waters in the northeast United States are typically rare, but recently, this region has shown an increase in infections attributed to the ecological introduction of pathogenic sequence type 36 (ST36) strains, which are endemic to the cool waters of the Pacific Northwest. A 2005 risk assessment performed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) modeled the postharvest growth of V. parahaemolyticus in oysters as a function of air temperature and the length of time the oysters remained unrefrigerated. This model, while useful, has raised questions about strain growth differences in oyster tissue and whether invasive pathogenic strains exhibit different growth rates than nonclinical strains, particularly at lower temperatures. To investigate this question, live eastern oysters were injected with ST36 clinical strains and non-ST36 nonclinical strains, and growth rates were measured using the most probable number (MPN) enumeration. The presence of V. parahaemolyticus was confirmed using PCR by targeting the thermolabile hemolysin gene (tlh), thermostable direct hemolysin (tdh), tdh-related hemolysin (trh), and a pathogenesis-related protein (prp). The growth rates of the ST36 strains were compared to the FDA model and several other data sets of V. parahaemolyticus growth in naturally inoculated oysters harvested from the Chesapeake Bay. Our data indicate that the growth rates from most studies fall within the mean of the FDA model, but with slightly higher growth at lower temperatures for ST36 strains injected into live oysters. These data suggest that further investigations of ST36 growth capability in oysters at temperatures previously thought unsuitably low for Vibrio growth are warranted. IMPORTANCE Vibrio parahaemolyticus is the leading cause of seafood-related gastroenteritis in the United States, with an estimated 45,000 cases per year. Most individuals who suffer from vibriosis consume raw or undercooked seafood, including oysters. While gastroenteritis vibriosis is usually self-limiting and treatable, V. parahaemolyticus infections are a stressor on the growing aquaculture industry. Much effort has been placed on modeling the growth of Vibrio cells in oysters in order to aid oyster growers in designing harvesting best practices and ultimately, to protect the consumer. However, ecological invasions of nonnative bacterial strains make modeling their growth complicated, as these strains are not accounted for in current models. The National Shellfish Sanitation Program (NSSP) considers 10°C (50°F) a temperature too low to enable Vibrio growth, where 15°C is considered a cutoff temperature for optimal Vibrio growth, with temperatures approaching 20°C supporting higher growth rates. However, invasive strains may be native to cooler waters. This research aimed to understand strain growth in live oysters by measuring growth rates when oysters containing ST36 strains, which may be endemic to the U. S. Pacific Northwest, were exposed to multiple temperatures postharvest. Our results will be used to aid future model development and harvesting best practices for the aquaculture industry."

Such diseases will be termed thalassogenic--caused by the sea. Until recently these human health effects have been viewed primarily as local phenomena, not generally included in the world agenda of marine scientists dealing with global marine pollution problems. The massive global scale of the problem can be visualized when one considers that the wastewater and human body wastes of a significant portion of the world's population who reside along the coastline or in the vicinity of the sea are discharged daily, directly or indirectly, into the marine coastal waters, much of it with little or no treatment. Every cubic metre of raw domestic wastewater discharged into the sea can carry millions of infectious doses of pathogenic microorganisms. It is estimated that globally, foreign and local tourists together spend some 2 billion man-days annually at coastal recreational resorts and many are often exposed there to coastal waters polluted by wastewater. Annually some 800 million meals of potentially contaminated filter-feeding shellfish/bivalves and other sea foods, harvested in polluted waters are consumed, much of it raw or lightly steamed. A number of scientific studies have shown that swimmers swallow significant amounts of polluted seawater and can become ill with gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases from the pathogens they ingest. Based on risk assessments from the World Health Organization (WHO) and academic research sources the present study has made an estimate that globally, each year, there are in excess of 120 million cases of gastrointestinal disease and in excess of 50 million cases of more severe respiratory diseases caused by swimming and bathing in wastewater-polluted coastal waters. Filter-feeding shellfish/bivalves, which are often harvested from wastewater-polluted areas of the sea, can effectively filter out and concentrate the microbial pathogens in the seawater. It can be roughly estimated that annually there are some 4 million cases of infectious hepatitis A and E (HAV/HEV), with some 40 thousand deaths and 40 thousand cases of long-term disability, mainly chronic liver damage, from consuming raw or lightly steamed filter-feeding shellfish/molluscs harvested globally from polluted coastal waters. The total global health impact of the thalassogenic diseases--human infectious diseases associated with pathogenic microorganisms from land-based wastewater pollution of the seas--is estimated to be about 3 million 'disability-adjusted life years' (DALY)/year, with an estimated economic loss of some 12 billion dollars per year. Due to the preliminary nature of the estimates in this study it is appropriate to assume that all of the above figures are no more than first approximations and that the true figures may be 50% higher or lower. Nevertheless, it is the author's belief that this study indicates that wastewater pollution of the sea results in a multi-billion dollar per year health burden and that preventing wastewater pollution of the sea is worthy of inclusion on the global agenda of marine pollution prevention and control."

Unprocessed or minimally processed foods are good sources of different nutrients, so their safety and quality composition should be guaranteed in the most natural form that is obtained for human consumption. The objective of this scoping review (ScR) is to summarize the existing evidence about the presence of HM content (arsenic (As), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), methylmercury (MeHg), and aluminum (Al)) in unprocessed or minimally processed foods for human consumption worldwide during the period of 2011-2020. As a second objective, we identified reported HM values in food with respect to Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Food Standards for Maximum Limits (MLs) for contaminants in food. This ScR was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR); advance searches were performed in PubMed, ScienceDirect and FAO AGRIS (Agricultural Science and Technology Information) databases by two reviewers who independently performed literature searches with specific eligibility criteria. We classified individual foods in food groups and subgroups according to the Global Individual Information Food Consumption Data Tool (FAO/WHO GIFT). We homologated all the reported HM units to parts per million (ppm) to determine the weighted mean HM concentration per country and food group/subgroup of the articles included. Then, we compared HM concentration findings with FAO/WHO MLs. Finally, we used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to present our findings. Using our search strategy, we included 152 articles. Asia was the continent with the highest number of publications (n = 79, 51.3%), with China being the country with the largest number of studies (n = 34). Fish and shellfish (n = 58), followed by vegetables (n = 39) and cereals (n = 38), were the food groups studied the most. Fish (n = 42), rice (n = 33), and leafy (n = 28) and fruiting vegetables (n = 29) were the most studied food subgroups. With respect to the HM of interest, Cd was the most analyzed, followed by Pb, As, Hg and Al. Finally, we found that many of the HM concentrations reported exceeded the FAO/OMS MLs established for Cd, Pb and As globally in all food groups, mainly in vegetables, followed by the roots and tubers, and cereals food groups. Our study highlights the presence of HM in the most natural forms of food around the world, in concentrations that, in fact, exceed the MLs, which affects food safety and could represent a human health risk. In countries with regulations on these topics, a monitoring system is recommended to evaluate and monitor compliance with national standards. For countries without a regulation system, it is recommended to adopt international guidelines, such as those of FAO, and implement a monitoring system that supervises national compliance. In both cases, the information must be disseminated to the population to create social awareness. This is especially important to protect the population from the consumption of internal production and for the international markets of the globalized world."

            - Foods: fish, shellfish, rice, gluten-free diets (GFDs)</s>","Specific foods such as fish and rice have high concentrations of metals such as arsenic, mercury, lead, cadmium, and cobalt. Many gluten-free diets (GFDs) include these foods, so we evaluated whether a GFD was associated with increased metal bioaccumulation. We performed a population-based, cross-sectional study using data collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), from 2009 through 2012, collecting information on the diagnosis of celiac disease and adherence to a GFD. We tested NHANES blood samples to identify individuals with undiagnosed celiac disease, using assays for immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase followed by a confirmatory test for endomysial antibody. Among a total of 11,354 NHANES participants, celiac disease was diagnosed in 55 participants, based on test results or a reported clinical diagnosis. We collected NHANES survey data on blood levels of lead, mercury, and cadmium from subjects who were on a GFD (n = 115) and participants who were not on a GFD (n = 11,239). Levels of total arsenic in urine samples were available from 3901 subjects not following a GFD and 32 individuals following a GFD. NHANES participants were asked questions about fish and shellfish consumption. We performed multivariate logistic regression analyses to associate gluten-related conditions with blood concentrations of mercury, cadmium, and lead and urine concentration of total arsenic, adjusting for demographic characteristics, as well as for rice consumption or seafood intake. Geometric means were reported for urinary concentrations of total arsenic and blood concentrations of mercury, cadmium, and lead for demographic groups and subjects with gluten-related conditions (subjects without celiac disease who avoid gluten). Persons following a GFD had significantly increased total blood mercury levels (1.37 mcg/L) compared with persons not on a GFD (0.93 mcg/L) (P =.008), as well as increased blood levels of lead (1.42 vs 1.13 mcg/L; P =.007) and cadmium (0.42 vs 0.34 mcg/L; P =.03). Urine samples from subjects on a GFD had higher concentrations of total arsenic (15.15 mcg/L) than urine samples from subjects not on a GFD (8.38 mcg/L) (P =.002). After controlling for demographic characteristics, levels of all heavy metals remained significantly higher in persons following a GFD, compared with those not following a GFD. After exclusion of persons with celiac disease, people without celiac disease on a GFD (n = 101) had significantly increased blood concentrations of total mercury (1.40 mcg/L) than persons without celiac disease and not on a GFD (n = 10,890) (0.93 mcg/L; P =.02) and higher blood concentrations of lead (1.44 vs 1.13 mcg/L; P =.01) and higher urine concentrations of total arsenic (14.69 mcg/L [n = 3632] vs 8.32 mcg/L [n = 28]; P =.01). Blood samples from persons without celiac disease avoiding gluten had higher levels of cadmium (0.42 mcg/L) than persons without celiac disease and not following a GFD (0.34 mcg/L), but this difference was not significant (P =.06). In an analysis of data collected from NHANES, persons on a GFD had significantly higher urine levels of total arsenic and blood levels of mercury, lead, and cadmium than persons not avoiding gluten. Studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of accumulation of these elements in persons on a GFD."

            {'fish': ['Hg'], 'shellfish': ['Hg']}</s>","Mercury (Hg) is a ubiquitous global contaminant with important public health implications. Mercury is released from a variety of anthropogenic, industrial processes, enters the earth's atmosphere and is re-deposited onto the earth's surface in rainfall. Much of this Hg enters the oceans which cover the majority of the earth's surface. In the marine environment, inorganic Hg is converted to the most toxic form of the element, methylmercury, and biomagnified through the trophic levels of the food web. The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is the apex predator in many estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Due to their long life span and trophic position, bottlenose dolphins bioaccumulate high concentrations of contaminants including Hg, thus making them an important sentinel species for ecosystem and public health. Bottlenose dolphins in Florida bioaccumulate high concentrations of Hg in their blood, skin and internal organs. The concentrations of Hg in blood and skin of bottlenose dolphins of the Indian River Lagoon, FL (IRL) are among the highest reported world-wide. In previous studies, we demonstrated associations between concentrations of total Hg in the blood and skin of IRL dolphins and markers of endocrine, renal, hepatic, hematologic and immune system dysfunction. The predominant manifestation of exposure to mercury in humans is neurotoxicity. During the 1950s and 1960s, residents of Minamata bay, Japan were exposed to high concentrations of methyl mercury as the result of ingestion of fish and shellfish that had become contaminated in this infamous environmental disaster. Affected adults had severe motor and sensory abnormalities often leading to death. Methyl mercury crosses the placenta during pregnancy. Children exposed in utero were born with multiple congenital anomalies and also suffered from neurologic disorders. Significantly, local cats that consumed Hg contaminated fish developed severe signs of neurotoxicity which led to their subsequent description as the ""dancing cats of Minamata bay"". Unfortunately, the cause of these strange manifestations in cats was not recognized in time to prevent hundreds of additional cases from occurring. More recent studies have shown that exposure to mercury as a result of seafood consumption during pregnancy may result in multiple cognitive and neurodevelopmental effects in children. The levels of mercury found in bottlenose dolphins and the health effects we identified alerted us to the possibility of an important public health hazard. The IRL occupies 40 percent of the east coast of Florida and is bordered by counties with approximately 2.5 million human inhabitants. Therefore, we hypothesized that local inhabitants in communities bordering the IRL could be at risk of exposure to Hg from the consumption of fish and shellfish. We measured hair Hg in 135 local residents and found a mean concentration of 1.53 µg/g which was higher than that from previous studies of sport fishermen and coastal residents in other states. Over 50% of participants had a hair Hg concentration which exceeded the U. S. EPA exposure guideline. Hair Hg concentration was directly related to the frequency of seafood consumption and to the proportion of fish and shellfish obtained from local recreational sources. This study clearly exemplifies the importance of an animal sentinel in identifying a public health hazard and is virtually unique in ""closing the loop"" between animal and human health."

{'fo","Several groups of viruses may infect persons after ingestion and then are shed via stool. Of these, the norovirus (NoV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) are currently recognised as the most important human foodborne pathogens with regard to the number of outbreaks and people affected in the Western world. NoV and HAV are highly infectious and may lead to widespread outbreaks. The clinical manifestation of NoV infection, however, is relatively mild. Asymptomatic infections are common and may contribute to the spread of the infection. Introduction of NoV in a community or population (a seeding event) may be followed by additional spread because of the highly infectious nature of NoV, resulting in a great number of secondary infections (50% of contacts). Hepatitis A is an increasing problem because of the decrease in immunity of populations in countries with high standards of hygiene. Molecular-based methods can detect viruses in shellfish but are not yet available for other foods. The applicability of the methods currently available for monitoring foods for viral contamination is unknown. No consistent correlation has been found between the presence of indicator microorganisms (i. e. bacteriophages, E. coli) and viruses. NoV and HAV are highly infectious and exhibit variable levels of resistance to heat and disinfection agents. However, they are both inactivated at 100 degrees C. No validated model virus or model system is available for studies of inactivation of NoV, although investigations could make use of structurally similar viruses (i. e. canine and feline caliciviruses). In the absence of a model virus or model system, food safety guidelines need to be based on studies that have been performed with the most resistant enteric RNA viruses (i. e. HAV, for which a model system does exist) and also with bacteriophages (for water). Most documented foodborne viral outbreaks can be traced to food that has been manually handled by an infected foodhandler, rather than to industrially processed foods. The viral contamination of food can occur anywhere in the process from farm to fork, but most foodborne viral infections can be traced back to infected persons who handle food that is not heated or otherwise treated afterwards. Therefore, emphasis should be on stringent personal hygiene during preparation. If viruses are present in food preprocessing, residual viral infectivity may be present after some industrial processes. Therefore, it is key that sufficient attention be given to good agriculture practice (GAP) and good manufacturing practice (GMP) to avoid introduction of viruses onto the raw material and into the food-manufacturing environment, and to HACCP to assure adequate management of (control over) viruses present during the manufacturing process. If viruses are present in foods after processing, they remain infectious in most circumstances and in most foods for several days or weeks, especially if kept cooled (at 4 degrees C). Therefore, emphasis should be on stringent personal hygiene during preparation. For the control of foodborne viral infections, it is necessary to: Heighten awareness about the presence and spread of these viruses by foodhandlers; Optimise and standardise methods for the detection of foodborne viruses; Develop laboratory-based surveillance to detect large, common-source outbreaks at an early stage; and Emphasise consideration of viruses in setting up food safety quality control and management systems (GHP, GMP, HACCP)."

The symptoms of these kinds of toxins include severe diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea and gastrointestinal disorders. These symptoms could be hardly distinguished with many other symptoms of food poisoning and diseases. Therefore, a fast and accurate determination method in human biological samples is urgently needed for the accurate judgement of food poisoning incident, which is important for the investigation of public health emergencies and clinical treatment of poisoned patients. However, there were several flaws of the previous studies reported on the analysis of lipophilic shellfish toxins: (1) limited target compounds were covered; (2) the pre-treatment process was complex; (3) the sensitivity of the compound was low. In this study, a simple extraction method coupled with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous determination of 12 lipophilic shellfish toxins, including azaspir acid 1 (AZA1), azaspir acid 2 (AZA2), azaspir acid 3 (AZA3), dinophysistoxin 1 (DTX1), dinophysistoxin 2 (DTX2), gymnodimine (GYM), hyessotoxin (HYTX), okadaic acid (OA), pinnatoxin (Pntx), pectenotoxins 2 (PTX2), spirolides 1 (SPX1), yessotoxin (YTX), in plasma and urine. Firstly, the instrument conditions were optimized. Different additions in mobile phase were compared and 0.05% (v/v) ammonia solution was selected since it can improve the peak shape of YTX and HYTX, and increase the respondence by four times. Secondly, the volume of acetonitrile (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 mL) use for the extraction of the target compounds in plasma was optimized. Satisfactory recoveries were obtained when 0.6 mL of acetonitrile was used. At the same time, satisfactory recoveries were obtained when 0.9 mL of acetonitrile was used in urine samples. Finally, under the optimized conditions, the 12 compounds in plasma and urine samples were ultrasonically extracted with acetonitrile. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 column (50 mm×3 mm, 2.6 μm) with 90% (v/v) acetonitrile aqueous solution and water containing 0.05% (v/v) ammonia as mobile phases. Gradient elution with a flow rate of 0.40 mL/min was employed. The 12 compounds were monitored in the multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) mode with electrospray ionization (ESI) under both positive and negative conditions. The matrix effects of the 12 compounds ranged from 0.8 to 1.1. Therefore, external standard calibration curves were used for the quantification. The 12 shellfish toxins showed good linear relationship in the range of 0.03-36.25 μg/L with the correlation coefficients greater than 0.995. The limits of detection (LODs, S/N=3) were 0.08-0.21 ng/mL for the urine samples and 0.10-0.28 μg/L for the plasma samples, respectively. The limit of quantitations (LOQs, S/N=10) were 0.23-0.63 μg/L for the urine samples and 0.31-0.84 μg/L for the plasma samples, respectively. The recoveries of the 12 compounds were in the range of 72.7%-124.1% at three spiked levels (i. e. , LOQ, three times LOQ, and ten times LOQ). The intra-day and inter-day precisions were 2.1%-20.0% and 2.1%-15.3%, respectively. The method was applied in the detection of the 12 lipophilic shellfish toxins in the urine and plasma samples of healthy humans and mice previously injected with the 12 shellfish toxins intraperitoneally. None of the 12 toxins were found in the samples from healthy human, while all of the 12 lipophilic shellfish toxins were found in the urine and plasma samples collected from the poisoned mice in the range of 1.14-2.35 μg/L and 1.01-1.17 μg/L, respectively. The established method has the advantages of sensitive, quick, easy to operate, and of low sample volume. It can be used for the simultaneous determination of 12 lipophilic shellfish toxins in urine and plasma samples."

Here, a review of the status of this complex array of marine HAB problems in the U. S. is presented, providing historical information and trends as well as future perspectives. The study relies on thirty years (1990-2019) of data in HAEDAT - the IOC-ICES-PICES Harmful Algal Event database, but also includes many other reports. At a qualitative level, the U. S. national HAB problem is far more extensive than was the case decades ago, with more toxic species and toxins to monitor, as well as a larger range of impacted resources and areas affected. Quantitatively, no significant trend is seen for paralytic shellfish toxin (PST) events over the study interval, though there is clear evidence of the expansion of the problem into new regions and the emergence of a species that produces PSTs in Florida - Pyrodinium bahamense. Amnesic shellfish toxin (AST) events have significantly increased in the U. S. , with an overall pattern of frequent outbreaks on the West Coast, emerging, recurring outbreaks on the East Coast, and sporadic incidents in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the long historical record of neurotoxic shellfish toxin (NST) events, no significant trend is observed over the past 30 years. The recent emergence of diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DSTs) in the U. S. began along the Gulf Coast in 2008 and expanded to the West and East Coasts, though no significant trend through time is seen since then. Ciguatoxin (CTX) events caused by Gambierdiscus dinoflagellates have long impacted tropical and subtropical locations in the U. S. , but due to a lack of monitoring programs as well as under-reporting of illnesses, data on these events are not available for time series analysis. Geographic expansion of Gambierdiscus into temperate and non-endemic areas (e. g. , northern Gulf of Mexico) is apparent, and fostered by ocean warming. HAB-related marine wildlife morbidity and mortality events appear to be increasing, with statistically significant increasing trends observed in marine mammal poisonings caused by ASTs along the coast of California and NSTs in Florida. Since their first occurrence in 1985 in New York, brown tides resulting from high-density blooms of Aureococcus have spread south to Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, while those caused by Aureoumbra have spread from the Gulf Coast to the east coast of Florida. Blooms of Margalefidinium polykrikoides occurred in four locations in the U. S. from 1921-2001 but have appeared in more than 15 U. S. estuaries since then, with ocean warming implicated as a causative factor. Numerous blooms of toxic cyanobacteria have been documented in all 50 U. S. states and the transport of cyanotoxins from freshwater systems into marine coastal waters is a recently identified and potentially significant threat to public and ecosystem health. Taken together, there is a significant increasing trend in all HAB events in HAEDAT over the 30-year study interval. Part of this observed HAB expansion simply reflects a better realization of the true or historic scale of the problem, long obscured by inadequate monitoring. Other contributing factors include the dispersion of species to new areas, the discovery of new HAB poisoning syndromes or impacts, and the stimulatory effects of human activities like nutrient pollution, aquaculture expansion, and ocean warming, among others. One result of this multifaceted expansion is that many regions of the U. S. now face a daunting diversity of species and toxins, representing a significant and growing challenge to resource managers and public health officials in terms of toxins, regions, and time intervals to monitor, and necessitating new approaches to monitoring and management. Mobilization of funding and resources for research, monitoring and management of HABs requires accurate information on the scale and nature of the national problem. HAEDAT and other databases can be of great value in this regard but efforts are needed to expand and sustain the collection of data regionally and nationally."

Dinoflagellates, primarily Dinophysis spp. , intermittently yield concentrations of Diarrhetic Shellfish Toxins (DST) in blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, above regulatory limits along the coasts of Norway, Denmark and the Swedish west coast. On average, DST levels in shellfish have decreased along the Swedish and Norwegian Skagerrak coasts since approximately 2006, coinciding with a decrease in the cell abundance of D. acuta. Among dinoflagellates, Alexandrium species are the major source of Paralytic Shellfish Toxins (PST) in the region. PST concentrations above regulatory levels were rare in the Skagerrak-Kattegat during the three decadal review period, but frequent and often abundant findings of Alexandrium resting cysts in surface sediments indicate a high potential risk for blooms. PST levels often above regulatory limits along the west coast of Norway are associated with A. catenella (ribotype Group 1) as the main toxin producer. Other Alexandrium species, such as A. ostenfeldii and A. minutum, are capable of producing PST among some populations but are usually not associated with PSP events in the region. The cell abundance of A. pseudogonyaulax, a producer of the ichthyotoxin goniodomin (GD), has increased in the Skagerrak-Kattegat since 2010, and may constitute an emerging threat. The dinoflagellate Azadinium spp. have been unequivocally linked to the presence of azaspiracid toxins (AZT) responsible for Azaspiracid Shellfish Poisoning (AZP) in northern Europe. These toxins were detected in bivalve shellfish at concentrations above regulatory limits for the first time in Norway in blue mussels in 2005 and in Sweden in blue mussels and oysters (Ostrea edulis and Crassostrea gigas) in 2018. Certain members of the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia produce the neurotoxin domoic acid and analogs known as Amnesic Shellfish Toxins (AST). Blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia were common in the North Sea and the Skagerrak-Kattegat, but levels of AST in bivalve shellfish were rarely above regulatory limits during the review period. Summer cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea are a concern mainly for tourism by causing massive fouling of bathing water and beaches. Some of the cyanobacteria produce toxins, e. g. Nodularia spumigena, producer of nodularin, which may be a human health problem and cause occasional dog mortalities. Coastal and shelf sea regions in northern Europe provide a key supply of seafood, socioeconomic well-being and ecosystem services. Increasing anthropogenic influence and climate change create environmental stressors causing shifts in the biogeography and intensity of HABs. Continued monitoring of HAB and phycotoxins and the operation of historical databases such as HAEDAT provide not only an ongoing status report but also provide a way to interpret causes and mechanisms of HABs."

The pathway and toxicology of food chain contaminated with environmental Hg are rarely revealed by proteomics. Here, we showed that differential proteomics had the potential to understand reproduction toxicity mechanism in marine molluscs through the Hg-contaminated food chain. Hg bioaccumulation was found in every link of the HgCl2-Chlorella vulgaris-oyster-mice food chain. Morphological observations identified the lesions in both the oyster gonad and the mice ovary. Differential proteomics was used to study the mechanisms of Hg toxicity in the oyster gonad and to find some biomarkers of Hg contamination in food chain. Using 2-DE and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, we identified 13 differential protein spots, of which six were up-regulated, six were down-regulated, while one was undecided. A portion of these differential proteins was further confirmed using real-time PCR and western blotting methods. Their major functions involved binding, protein translocation, catalysis, regulation of energy metabolism, reproductive functioning and structural molecular activity. Among these proteins, 14-3-3 protein, GTP binding protein, arginine kinase (AK) and 71kDa heat shock connate protein (HSCP 71) are considered to be suitable biomarkers of environmental Hg contamination. Furthermore, we established the gene correspondence, responding to Hg reproductive toxicity, between mouse and oyster, and then used real-time PCR to analyze mRNA differential expression of the corresponding genes in mice. The results indicated that the mechanism of Hg reproductive toxicity in mouse was similar to that in oyster. We suggest that the proteomics would be further developed in application research of food safety including toxicological mechanism. It is well known that mercury (Hg) is one of the best toxic metal elements in nature. The research reports as previously described indicated that multiple mercury compounds can directly contaminate the aquatic animals by flowing of water body and through the diffusion of air. The pollution sources of the mercury compounds in marine water were mainly found from the pathways such as steam power plant and mineral exploitation which are located on the inshore. Of note, after being released into environmental waters, mercury compounds undergo the processes of bioaccumulation, transformation and transmission in living organisms, thus resulting in the multiple forms of Hg found in Hg-toxicity food chains, and among them, methyl mercury (MeHg) showing the high toxic characteristics is the main form of Hg. The abundant reports indicated that the metal salts were easily found within the various organs of the animals, but it is difficult to judge the level of its perniciousness according to its content only in vivo. Here, the algae to have been contaminated by the mercury compounds have the ability for contaminating both the fish and shellfish as food pathway quickly. If these fish and shellfish edible as food will be taken by human, they will further affect the human health badly. However, studies about their perniciousness are rarely reported, especially in using proteomics. The oysters as normal food are largely consumed in Southern China, especially in Xiamen City. Similarly, a pathway question that the contaminated oysters can effect on the human health such as cancer is unclear or poorly understood. Here, we showed that an analytical technology such as differential proteomics has potential to understand toxicity mechanism induced by Hg-contamination through the food pathway. It is for reason that the oyster proteomics including relative analytical methods have been used to reveal the contaminant level and to determine its perniciousness using toxic algae as food. Here, we also indicated that the research here shows great significance for both analysis of food safety and toxicology of the metal compounds. In addition, a few biomarkers have shown their strong potential for monitoring the level of Hg pollution in sea in the manuscript and gene correspondence between mouse and oyster, the two contiguous links of the Hg-contaminated food chain, was further investigated to better illustrate our finding in the analysis of food chain proteomics. Moreover, similar research work is rarely reported compared to the current proteomic development, showing that a lot of novel results by proteomic methods in the manuscript have strong potential for developing the new area of food chain proteomics."

CCA from a shipment, apparently intended for treating electric poles, is leaking into the soil in the port area. CCA is a pesticide used to protect wood against decay-causing organisms. This mixture commonly contains chromium(VI) (hexavalent chromium) as chromic acid, arsenic(V) (pentavalent arsenic) as arsenic pentoxide and copper (II) (divalent copper) as cupric oxide, often in an aqueous solution or concentrate. Experimental studies of the fate of CCA in soil and monitoring studies of wood-preserving sites where CCA was spilled on the soil indicate that the chromium(VI), arsenic and copper components of CCA can leach from soil into groundwater and surface water. In addition, at CCA wood-preserving sites, substantial concentrations of chromium(VI), arsenic and copper remained in the soil and were leachable into water four years after the use of CCA was discontinued, suggesting prolonged persistence in soil, with continued potential for leaching. The degree of leaching depended on soil composition and the extent of soil contamination with CCA. In general, leaching was highest for chromium(VI), intermediate for arsenic and lowest for copper. Thus, the potential for contamination of sources of drinking water exists. Although arsenic that is leached from CCA-contaminated soil into surface water may accumulate in the tissues of fish and shellfish, most of the arsenic in these animals will be in a form (often called fish arsenic) that is less harmful. Copper, which leaches less readily than the other components, can accumulate in tissues of mussels and oysters. Chromium is not likely to accumulate in the tissues of fish and shellfish. Limited studies of air concentrations during cleanup of CCA-contaminated soil at wood- preserving sites showed that air levels of chromium(VI), arsenic and copper were below the occupational standards. Workers directly involved in the repackaging, containment or cleanup of leaking containers of CCA or of soil saturated with CCA, however, may be exposed to high levels of CCA through direct dermal contact, inhalation of aerosols or particulates and inadvertent ingestion. Few studies have been conducted on the health effects of CCA. CCA as a concentrated solution is corrosive to the skin eyes and digestive tract. Studies of workers exposed to CCA in wood-preserving plants have not found adverse health effects in these workers, but the studies involved small numbers of workers and therefore are not definitive. People exposed to very high levels of CCA, from sawing wood that still had liquid CCA in it or from living in a home contaminated with ash containing high levels of chromium(VI), arsenic and copper, experienced serious health effects including nosebleeds, digestive system pain and bleeding, itching skin, darkened urine, nervous system effects such as tingling or numbness of the hands and feet and confusion, and rashes or thickening and peeling of the skin. These health effects of the mixture are at least qualitatively reflective of the health effects of the individual components of CCA (arsenic, chromium(VI) and copper). For a given mixture, the critical effects of the individual components are of particular concern, as are any effects in common that may become significant due to additivity or interactions among the components. Effects of concern for CCA, based on the known effects of the individual components, include cancer (arsenic by the oral route, arsenic and chromium(VI) by the inhalation route), irritant or corrosive effects (all three mixture components), the unique dermal effects of arsenic, neurologic effects (arsenic and chromium(VI), and hematologic, hepatic and renal effects (all three components). Because arsenic, chromium(VI), and copper components affect some of the same target organs, they may have additive toxicity toward those organs. Few studies have investigated the potential toxic interactions among the components (arsenic, chromium(VI) and copper) of CCA. The available interaction studies and also possible mechanisms of interaction were evaluated using a weight-of-evidence approach. The conclusion is that there is no strong evidence that interactions among the components of CCA will result in a marked increase in toxicity. This conclusion reflects a lack of well designed interaction studies as well as uncertainties regarding potential mechanisms of interaction. Confidence in the conclusion is low. Workers exposed to high levels of CCA during cleanup of leaking containers of CCA or soil heavily contaminated with CCA should wear protective clothing and respirators if air concentrations of arsenic are above 10 microg/m3. In addition, they should not eat, drink or use tobacco products during exposure to CCA, and should thoroughly wash after skin contact with CCA and before eating, drinking, using tobacco products or using restrooms. When protective clothing becomes contaminated with CCA, it should be changed, and the contaminated clothing should be disposed off in a manner approved for pesticide disposal. Workers should leave all protective clothing, including work shoes and boots, at the workplace, so that CCA will not be carried into their cars and homes, which would endanger other people. People not involved in the cleanup of the CCA and who are not wearing protective clothing should be prevented from entering contaminated areas. Leaking containers of CCA must be repackaged and contained to prevent direct exposure of on-site personnel; and contaminated soil needs to be removed to prevent the CCA from leaching into surface water and groundwater, thereby contaminating sources of drinking water."

","In this review, we address the identification of residual chemical hazards in shellfish collected from the marine environment or in marketed shellfish. Data, assembled on the concentration of contaminants detected, were compared with the appropriate regulatory and food safety standards. Moreover, data on human exposure and body burden levels were evaluated in the context of potential health risks. Shellfish farming is a common industry along European coasts. The primary types of shellfish consumed in France are oysters, mussels, king scallops, winkles,whelks, cockles, clams, and other scallops. Shellfish filter large volumes of water to extract their food and are excellent bioaccumulators. Metals and other pollutants that exist in the marine environment partition into particular organs, according to their individual chemical characteristics. In shellfish, accumulation often occurs in the digestive gland, which plays a role in assimilation, excretion, and detoxification of contaminants. The concentrations of chemical contaminants in bivalve mollusks are known to fluctuate with the seasons. European regulations limit the amount and type of contaminants that can appear in foodstuffs. Current European standards regulate the levels of micro-biological agents, phycotoxins, and some chemical contaminants in food. Since 2006, these regulations have been compiled into the ""Hygiene Package. "" Bivalve mollusks must comply with maximum levels of certain contaminants as follows:lead (1.5 mg kg-1), cadmium (1 mg kg-1), mercury (0.5 mg kg-1), dioxins (4 pg g-1 and dioxins + DL-PCBs 8 pg g-1), and benzo[a]pyrene (10 μp. g kg-1). In this review, we identify the levels of major contaminants that exist in shellfish(collected from the marine environment and/or in marketed shellfish). The follow-ing contaminants are among those that are profiled: Cd, Pb, Hg, As, Ni, Cr, V,Mn, Cu, Zn, Co, Se, Mg, Mo, radionuclides, benzo[a]pyrene, PCBs, dioxins and furans, PAHs, TBT, HCB, dieldrin, DDT, lindane, triazines, PBDE, and chlorinated paraffins. In France, the results of contaminant monitoring have indicated that Cd, but not lead (< 0.26 mg kg-1) or mercury (< 0.003 mg kg-1), has had some non-compliances. Detections for PCBs and dioxins in shellfish were far below the regulatory thresholds in oysters (< 0.6 pg g-l), mussels (< 0.6 pg g-1), and king scallops (< 0.4 pg g-1). The benzo[a]pyrene concentration in marketed mussels and farmed shellfish does not exceed the regulatory threshold. Some monitoring data are available on shellfish flesh contamination for unregulated organic contaminants. Of about 100 existing organo stannic compounds, residues of the mono-, di-, and tributyltin (MBT, DBT, and TBT) and mono-, di-, and triphenyltin (MPT, DPT,and TPT) compounds are the most frequently detected in fishery products. Octyltins are not found in fishery products. Some bivalve mollusks show arsenic levels up to 15.8 mg kg-1. It seems that the levels of arsenic in the environment derive less from bioaccumulation, than from whether the arsenic is in an organic or an inorganic form. In regard to the other metals, levels of zinc and magnesium are higher in oysters than in mussels. To protect shellfish from chemical contamination, programs have been established to monitor water masses along coastal areas. The French monitoring network(ROCCH) focuses on environmental matrices that accumulate contaminants. These include both biota and sediment. Example contaminants were studied in a French coastal lagoon (Arcachon Bay) and in an estuary (Bay of Seine), and these were used to illustrate the usefulness of the monitoring programs. Twenty-one pesticidal and biocidal active substances were detected in the waters of Arcachon Bay during the summers from 1999 to 2003, at concentrations ranging from a few nanograms per liter to several hundred nanograms per liter. Most of the detected substances were herbicides, including some that are now banned. Organotin compounds have been detected in similarly semi-enclosed waters elsewhere (bays, estuaries, and harbors). However, the mean concentrations of cadmium, mercury, lead, and benzo[a]pyrene,in transplanted mussels, were below the regulatory limits. In 2007, the mean daily consumption of shellfish in the general French population was estimated to be 4.5 g in adults; however, a wide variation occurs by region and season (INCA 2 study). Tabulated as a proportion of the diet, shellfish consumption represents only 0.16% of overall solid food intake. However, the INCA 2 survey was not well suited to estimating shellfish consumption because of the small number of shellfish consumers sampled. In contrast, the mean consumption rate of bivalve mollusks among adult high consumers of fish and seafood products, i. e. , adults who eat fish or seafood at least twice a week, was estimated to be 153 g week-1 (8 kg yr-1). The highest mean consumption is for king scallops (39 g week-1), followed by oysters (34 g week-1) and mussels (22 g week-1). Thus, for high seafood consumers, the contribution of shellfish to inorganic contaminant levels is 1-10% TWI or PTWI for Cd, MeHg, and Sn (up to 19% for Sn), and the arsenic body burden is higher for 22% of individuals studied. The human health risks associated with consuming chemical contaminants in shellfish are difficult to assess for several reasons: effects may only surface after long-term exposure (chronic risk), exposures may be discontinuous, and contamination may derive from multiple sources (food, air, occupational exposure, etc. ). Therefore, it is not possible to attribute a high body burden specifically to shellfish consumption even if seafood is a major dietary contributor of any contaminant, e. g. ,arsenic and mercury. The data assembled in this review provide the arguments for maintaining the chemical contaminant monitoring programs for shellfish. Moreover, the results presented herein suggest that monitoring programs should be extended to other chemicals that are suspected of presenting a risk to consumers, as illustrated by the high concentration reported for arsenic (in urine) of high consumers of seafood products from the CALIPSO study. In addition, the research conducted in shellfish-farming areas of Arcachon Bay highlights the need to monitor TBT and PAH contamination levels to ensure that these chemical pollutants do not migrate from the harbor to oyster farms. Finally, we have concluded that shellfish contamination from seawater offers a rather low risk to the general French population, because shellfish do not constitute a major contributor to dietary exposure of chemical contaminants. Notwithstanding,consumer vigilance is necessary among regular shellfish consumers, and especially for those residing in fishing communities, for pregnant and breast-feeding women,and for very young children."

S. involving potential exposures to methylmercury currently use a reference dose (RfD) developed by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). This RfD is based on retrospective studies of an acute poisoning incident in Iraq in which grain contaminated with a methylmercury fungicide was inadvertently used in the baking of bread. The exposures, which were relatively high but lasted only a few months, were associated with neurological effects in both adults (primarily paresthesia) and infants (late walking, late talking, etc. ). It is generally believed that the developing fetus represents a particularly sensitive subpopulation for the neurological effects of methylmercury. The USEPA derived an RfD of 0.1 microg/kg/day based on benchmark dose (BMD) modeling of the combined neurological endpoints reported for children exposed in utero. This RfD included an uncertainty factor of 10 to consider human pharmacokinetic variability and database limitations (lack of data on multigeneration effects or possible long-term sequelae of perinatal exposure). Alcoa signed an Administrative Order of Consent for the conduct of a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) at their Point Comfort Operations and the adjacent Lavaca Bay in Texas to address the effects of historical discharges of mercury-containing wastewater. In cooperation with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and USEPA Region VI, Alcoa conducted a baseline risk assessment to assess potential risk to human health and the environment. As a part of this assessment. Alcoa pursued the development of a site-specific RfD for methylmercury to specifically address the potential human health effects associated with the ingestion of contaminated finfish and shellfish from Lavaca Bay. Application of the published USEPA RfD to this site is problematic; while the study underlying the RfD represented acute exposure to relatively high concentrations of methylmercury, the exposures of concern for the Point Comfort site are from the chronic consumption of relatively low concentrations of methylmercury in fish. Since the publication of the USEPA RfD, several analyses of chronic exposure to methylmercury in fish-eating populations have been reported. The purpose of the analysis reported here was to evaluate the possibility of deriving an RfD for methylmercury, specifically for the case of fish ingestion, on the basis of these new studies. In order to better support the risk-management decisions associated with developing a remediation approach for the site in question, the analysis was designed to provide information on the distribution of acceptable ingestion rates across a population, which could reasonably be expected to be consistent with the results of the epidemiological studies of other fish-eating populations. Based on a review of the available literature on the effects of methylmercury, a study conducted with a population in the Seychelles Islands was selected as the critical study for this analysis. The exposures to methylmercury in this population result from chronic, multigenerational ingestion of contaminated fish. This prospective study was carefully conducted and analyzed, included a large cohort of mother-infant pairs, and was relatively free of confounding factors. The results of this study are essentially negative, and a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) derived from the estimated exposures has recently been used by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) as the basis for a chronic oral minimal risk level (MRL) for methylmercury. In spite of the fact that no statistically significant effects were observed in this study, the data as reported are suitable for dose-response analysis using the BMD method. Evaluation of the BMD method used in this analysis, as well as in the current USEPA RfD, has demonstrated that the resulting 95% lower bound on the 10% benchmark dose (BMDL) represents a conservative estimate of the traditional NOAEL, and that it is superior to the use of ""average"" or ""grouped"" exposure estimates when dose-response information is available, as is the case for the Seychelles study. A more recent study in the Faroe Islands, which did report statistically significant associations between methylmercury exposure and neurological effects, could not be used for dose-response modeling due to inadequate reporting of the data and confounding from co-exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). BMD modeling over the wide range of neurological endpoints reported in the Seychelles study yielded a lowest BMDL for methylmercury in maternal hair of 21 ppm. This BMDL was then converted to an expected distribution of daily ingestion rates across a population using Monte Carlo analysis with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to evaluate the impact of interindividual variability. The resulting distribution of ingestion rates at the BMDL had a geometric mean of 1.60 microg/kg/day with a geometric standard deviation of 1.33; the 1st, 5th, and 10th percentiles of the distribution were 0.86, 1.04, and 1.15 microg/kg/day. In place of the use of an uncertainty factor of 3 for pharmacokinetic variability, as is done in the current RfD, one of these lower percentiles of the daily ingestion rate distribution provides a scientifically based, conservative basis for taking into consideration the impact of pharmacokinetic variability across the population. On the other hand, it was felt that an uncertainty factor of 3 for database limitations should be used in the current analysis. Although there can be high confidence in the benchmark-estimated NOAEL of 21 ppm in the Seychelles study, some results in the New Zealand and Faroe Islands studies could be construed to suggest the possibility of effects at maternal hair concentrations below 10 ppm. In addition, while concerns regarding the possibility of chronic sequelae are not supported by the available data, neither can they be absolutely ruled out. The use of an uncertainty factor of 3 is equivalent to using a NOAEL of 7 ppm in maternal hair, which provides additional protection against the possibility that effects could occur at lower concentrations in some populations. Based on the analysis described above, the distribution of acceptable daily ingestion rates (RfDs) recommended to serve as the basis for site-specific risk-management decisions at Alcoa's Point Comfort Operations ranges from approximately 0.3 to 1.1 microg/kg/day, with a population median (50th percentile) of 0.5 microg/kg/day. By analogy with USEPA guidelines for the use of percentiles in applications of distributions in exposure assessments, the 10th percentile provides a reasonably conservative measure. On this basis, a site-specific RfD of 0.4 microg/kg/day is recommended."

 or","Pollution - unwanted waste released to air, water, and land by human activity - is the largest environmental cause of disease in the world today. It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood. (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health. Topic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention. Pollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources - coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths. Ocean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks. Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase children's risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. Manufactured chemicals - phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste - can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the Global South - environmental injustice on a planetary scale. Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth's resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted. Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored. Prevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries. World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health. Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress. Further interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries. Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas."
