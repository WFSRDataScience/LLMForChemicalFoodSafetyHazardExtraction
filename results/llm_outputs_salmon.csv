We used archived fish scales of Atlantic salmon to reconstruct levels of historical copper pollution and its effects on salmon fitness. Copper bioaccumulation significantly increased over baseline values during the operation of the mine, reaching sublethal levels for salmon survival. Juvenile growth and relative population abundance decreased during mining, but no such effects were observed in a neighbouring river unaffected by mining.

Fish were preconditioned prior to the 19-week experimental feeding period to reduce long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) and persistent organic pollutant levels (POPs). Dietary POP levels differed significantly between treatments in the order of NFO>SFO>11 AM/5.5 AM and were subsequently reflected in the flesh. Fish fed the 11 AM diet contained similar DHA levels (g 100 g(-1) flesh) to FO-fed fish, despite percentage differences. However, the low levels of EPA in the diets and flesh of algal-fed fish compromised the overall nutritional value to the final consumer. Nevertheless, further developments in microalgae culture offer a promising alternative lipid source of LC-PUFA to FO in salmon feeds that warrants further investigation."

The samples (salmon, trout, tilapia, Arctic char, mussels, oysters, shrimp, and crab) represented the range of fish and shellfish commercially available to Canadian consumers at the time of purchase. Trout and salmon (geometric mean SigmaPBDE = 1600 and 1500 pg/g, wet weight, respectively) were found to contain significantly higher amounts of PBDEs than the mussel, tilapia, and shrimp groups (geometric mean SigmaPBDE = 260, 180, and 48 pg/g, wet weight, respectively). These differences in SigmaPBDE concentrations among fish and shellfish products were partly driven by differences in lipid content among the samples. Mean SigmaPBDE concentrations in domestic samples were also significantly greater than in imported samples, possibly reflecting global environmental distribution of PBDEs. These concentration differences will contribute to variations in dietary exposure to PBDEs when assorted fish and shellfish items from various origins are consumed."

From 16 475 households, 0.2 per cent (n=39) reported having had a transmission of pathogen from the raw pet food to a human family member during the time that raw feeding had been used in the household. Only in three of those households the same pathogen that was found in the human sample was analysed and confirmed also in the raw pet food (0.02 per cent of all data). Moreover, 0.1 per cent (n=24) reported suspecting that a disease could have been transmitted to a human from the pet food. Feeding salmon and turkey, using more than 50 per cent of the diet as raw foods and preparing the raw food in the same place and utensils as the family foods all had negative association with infections. Having 2 to 6 year-old children living in the household was associated with more infections, although adults were the most frequently infected."

One of the probabilistic methods was newly developed and is based on summary statistics of food consumption combined with a model generating realistic daily energy supply from food. Median (intermediate) doses of total PBDEs are in the range of 0.4-0.6 ng/kg(bw)/day for Irish adults. The 97.5th percentiles of total PBDE doses lie in a range of 1.7-2.2 ng/kg(bw)/day, which is comparable to doses derived for Belgian and Dutch adults.

Based on the observed fish consumption level in the sample, the mean intake of brominated diphenyl ether (BDE)-28, 47, 99, 100, 153, and 154 via fish was 0.85 ng/kg body weight (bw)/day and the intake of LC n-3 PUFAs was 3.45 mg/kg bw/day, being low compared to the recommendations. Scenario analyses showed that consuming 150 g salmon twice a week is advisable to achieve the recommended LC n-3 PUFA intake with a rather low PBDE intake. When replacing 150 g salmon by herring, the PBDE intake is higher without an increase in LC n-3 PUFAs. In contrast, the combination of cod and salmon leads to a similar PBDE intake compared to twice a week salmon, but to a lower LC n-3 PUFA intake. In conclusion, the methodology presented in the paper allows balancing benefits and risks related to fish consumption."

Both species of fish are globally important and among the ten most consumed fishes in the world. Although the sensory analyses showed a decrease in the quality of both fish species, only the salmon fillets were considered spoiled at the end of the storage period. In salmon, trimethylamine was the main spoilage product and bacterial colony counts reached an average of 7.3 log10 cfu/g. The concentration of glucose decreased and the concentration of organic acids increased during storage revealing glucose fermentation. Photobacterium was the dominating genus in the salmon studied. In the tuna studied, the bacterial colony counts reached only an average of 4.6 log10 cfu/g. The dominating bacteria in tuna were Pseudomonas spp. Glucose levels did not decrease, suggesting that amino acids and lactate most likely acted as carbon sources for bacteria in tuna. In conclusion, the study revealed that salmon was clearly a more perishable fish than tuna."

The cause of the outbreak was smoked salmon processed at a single site. The smoked salmon had been continuously contaminated in the processing lines through reusable dishes, which turned out to be porous and had become loaded with bacteria. This is the largest outbreak of salmonellosis ever recorded in the Netherlands. The temporary closure of the processing site and recall of the smoked salmon stopped the outbreak.

These results show differences in bioaccumulation of PCBs over time and space in this estuary, which may also occur for any contaminant that is distributed heterogeneously in this system. Highly mobile, outmigrating salmon accumulated approximately 3-5 times more PCBs on the east side of the LDW than fish on the west side, which is supported by an almost identical difference in mean sediment concentrations. The tPCB concentration data suggest that for most of the spring and early summer, juvenile chinook were likely segregated between the east and west side of the LDW, but may have crossed the channel later in the year as larger fish.

To control these contaminants, an analytical strategy based on a generic extraction followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) using quadrupole time-of-flight mass analyzer (QTOF MS) was applied for wide scope screening. Quality control samples, consisting of PAP commodities spiked at 0.02, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg with 150 analytes, were injected in every sample batch to verify the overall method performance. The methodology was applied to 19 commercially available PAP samples from six different types of matrices from the EU animal rendering industry. This strategy allows assessing possible emergent risk exposition of the salmon farming industry to 1005 undesirables, including pharmaceuticals, several dyes and relevant metabolites."

METHODS AND RESULTS:First, challenge tests with L. monocytogenes were carried out using HPP of the product at 0.1 (control), 150, 200 and 250 MPa. Secondly, storage trials with the naturally contaminated product and HPP at 0.1 (control) and 200 MPa were realized. Shelf-life, microbial changes and chemical changes were determined and existing predictive models and multiple compound quality indices evaluated. HPP with 250 MPa did not inactivate L. monocytogenes but significant lag phases of 17 and 10 days were observed at ca 5 and 10 degrees C, respectively. HPP with 200 MPa had a marked effect on both colour and texture of CSS. CONCLUSIONS:High-pressure processing was unable to prevent growth of L. monocytogenes or spoilage of chilled CSS. Existing mathematical models allowed growth rates of L. monocytogenes and shelf-life of samples without high-pressure treatments to be predicted. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:High-pressure processing seems more appropriate for new types of salmon products than for a classical product like CSS where consumers expect specific quality attributes."

Here we investigated PCB concentrations and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist activity in 17 n-3 PUFA supplements available in Canada.

Dictionary: {}</s>",{'Salmon': ['persistent organic pollutants (POPs)']}</s>,"There is increasing concern that some subsistence-oriented consumer groups may be exposed to elevated levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) through the consumption of certain traditional foods, including fish and other aquatic resources. Exposure to POPs has been associated with adverse health effects including immunotoxicity, endocrine disruption, and altered development in moderate to highly exposed humans and wildlife. The Sencoten (Saanich) First Nation consists of approximately 1900 people inhabiting communities in a near-urban setting in coastal British Columbia, Canada. A survey was conducted to document the relative importance of traditional foods in the diet of the Sencoten people, as a basis for the future assessment of exposure to, and risks associated with, environmental contaminants in such a diet. Salmon represented 42% of the total marine meals, but at least 24 other marine species were also consumed. Our study suggests that traditional marine foods remain very important to the social and economic well-being of the Sencoten, despite their proximity to an urban center. This information will be of value to those interested in nutritional, cultural, and health issues concerning subsistence-oriented First Nations peoples, and provides an important first step in risk assessment."

All salmon were hatched under uniform conditions, released into streams, and sampled approximately 120 days later for trace element analysis. For most elements, element concentrations in salmon tracked those in their prey. Fast-growing salmon had lower concentrations of all elements than slow growers, after accounting for prey concentrations. This pattern held for essential and nonessential elements, as well as elements that accumulate from food and those that can accumulate from water. At the sites with the fastest salmon growth, trace element concentrations in salmon were 37% (Cs) to 86% (Pb) lower than at sites where growth was suppressed. Given that concentrations were generally below levels harmful to salmon and that the pattern was consistent across all elements, we suggest that dilution of elements in larger biomass led to lower concentrations in fast-growing fish. Streams that foster rapid, efficient fish growth may produce fish with lower concentrations of elements potentially toxic for human and wildlife consumers."

Consumer perception of product safety often has little connection with any legitimate public health concern. This is particularly true for aquatic foods which have been politically targeted throughout the years by inaccurate assessment of product safety as part of a larger strategy to discourage purchases or to direct purchase to politically more acceptable product, for example from a ""farmed"" fish to a wild harvested one. Activists target the safety of foods harvested from the marine environment to promote an environmental agency, most recently mercury raising content in pelagic species such as tuna to scare women, particularly pregnant women, from consuming this otherwise healthful food. Recent scares have involved colorant and feed additives for farmed salmon, leading to mandatory retail labeling in Western US markets of ""added color"" for all farm raised salmonids to increase consumer concern about product safety and discourage purchases.

Mercury (Hg) contamination is a widespread environmental concern with serious health implications for humans and wildlife. Due to their unique life history, anadromous salmon may act as important vectors for this contaminant, transferring Hg between marine and freshwater ecosystems. Previous analyses have considered contaminant transport by salmon to be unidirectional. These studies have evaluated Hg import to freshwater by spawning adults, but have not quantitatively assessed export through the migration of juveniles to the ocean. To determine the total Hg burden to freshwater systems by sockeye salmon, we reconstructed the net transport of Hg to the Wood River System in Bristol Bay, Alaska accounting for fluxes in (via adults) and out (via juveniles) of the system. Hg concentrations were higher in juvenile than adult salmon. Hg export from freshwater systems by salmon ranged from 3 to 30% of total import. Proportional export by smolts may be higher for populations under heavy exploitation with strong density dependence in juvenile recruitment. Full consideration of contaminant loading by migratory species requires attention to the relative contaminant flux at all life history stages and the effects of density dependent growth and survival."

Eubothrium crassum was an intestinal parasite in salmon that also ""preyed upon"" sprat, because the parasites gained access to foodstuffs via the host (salmon) gut. Salmon contained significantly higher concentrations of total PCBs compared to both parasites and prey (sprat), but no difference in PCB concentration was found between sprat and E. crassum. Salmon biomagnified several PCB congeners from their diet (sprat), whereas parasites did not, despite the fact that both salmon and their parasites ingested the same prey. Differences in nutrient uptake mechanisms between the host and their parasites, in addition to the lack of a gastrointestinal tract in the cestode, may explain the lack of biomagnification in E. crassum. No difference was found in PCB congener distribution between parasites, salmon, and sprat, and none of the animal types showed a preference for accumulating more or less lipophilic congeners (congeners with a high or low octanol/water partition coefficient [K(ow)]).

Transparency in seafood inspection reporting varied widely among inspecting bodies. Estimation of violations in the untested fraction of seafood was precluded by a lack of information from inspecting bodies regarding the distinction between targeted and random sampling. Increased transparency could facilitate a more rigorous characterization of public health risks from consuming imported seafood."

In the first step, we cultured mono species and mixed species biofilms containing L. monocytogenes on stainless steel or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) at 8 °C for 48h. The biofilms were then exposed to quaternary ammonium- and hydrogen peroxide-based disinfectants. Residual total populations of L. monocytogenes were measured by qPCR, and viable culturable (VC) cell populations were quantified using standard microbiological culture-based techniques and by a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay coupled with a propidium monoazide treatment. Decreases in VC populations and the appearance of viable but non culturable (VBNC) populations were observed in response to treatment with the disinfectants. An 8 month sampling campaign in 4 smoked salmon processing plants was also carried out to detect L. monocytogenes in environmental samples. VBNC cells were detected mainly after the cleaning and disinfection operations. This study showed that industrial disinfectants did not inactivate all L. monocytogenes cells on inert surfaces. The presence of VBNC populations of L. monocytogenes in the smoked salmon processing environment is a public health concern."

In this study, an assessment of chemical and microbiological food safety, together with nutritional quality, was conducted on fish preserved using traditional smoke processing. High-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) residues accounted for only 0.6% of the total PAH in traditionally fully smoked salmon, and Benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) was not detected in the FN smoked or commercial smoked fish, respectively. The antimicrobial activity of the solvent extracts derived from smoked fish towards Listeria innocua was very low but detectable. The practice of using full and half-smoked processing for fish reduced all of the fatty acid concentrations and also minimized the further loss of essential omega-3 fatty acids to a greater extent than non-smoked fish during storage (p < 0.05). This finding corresponded to lower (p < 0.05) lipid oxidation in smoked fish. We conclude that the benefits of reducing lipid oxidation and retaining essential fatty acids during storage, together with a potentially significant reduction in Listeria contamination, are notable benefits of traditional smoke processing. Although B(a)P was not detected in FN smoked fish, attention should be given to controlling the temperature and smoking period applied during this processing to minimize potential long-term risks associated with PAH exposure."

We used HPLC/mass spectrometry to investigate the arsenolipids present in salmon (Salmo salar) before and after cooking by either baking or steaming. In raw salmon (total As 2.74 mg kg-1 dry mass, of which 6% was lipid-soluble), major arsenolipids were three arsenic hydrocarbons (oxo-AsHC 332, oxo-AsHC 360, and oxo-AsHC 404, ca 55% of total arsenolipids) and a band of unidentified less-polar arsenolipids (ca 40%), trace amounts of another four arsenic hydrocarbons and two thioxo analogs were also detected.

When no prior information is available, we recommend the beta (1/2, 1/2) prior or the confidence distribution. To illustrate the importance of these differences, the four methods were used in an applied example. We performed two-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the proportion of cold smoked salmon packs contaminated by Listeria monocytogenes, one dimension representing within-factory uncertainty, modeled by each of the four studied methods, and the other dimension representing variability between companies."

The daily intake of PCNs associated with this consumption was also determined. A total of 42 composite samples were analyzed by HRGC/HRMS. The highest PCN levels (ng/kg of fresh weight) were found in salmon (227) followed by mackerel (95) and red mullet (68), while the lowest levels of total PCNs corresponded to shrimp (4.9) and cuttlefish (2.7). With the exception of cephalopods and shellfish species, in which tetra-CN was the predominant homologue, penta-CN (60%) was the predominant contributor to total PCNs. For a standard male adult, PCN intake through the consumption of edible marine species was 1.53 ng/day. The highest contributions to this intake (ng/day) corresponded to salmon (0.41), sole (0.28) and tuna (0.24). Concerning health risks, species-specific TEFs such as those reported by WHO and NATO for PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs are not currently available for PCN congeners.

Environmental occurrence of 6PPD-quinone is probably high, because it is an oxidation product of a common tire rubber additive. Research on 6PPD-quinone toxicity in fish has revealed a rather unusual pattern, with closely related species exhibiting responses ranging from extreme sensitivity to no effect. Of 11 previously studied fish species, 6PPD-quinone was toxic to four. The species-specific toxicity of 6PPD-quinone complicates urgently needed environmental risk assessment. We investigated the acute toxicity of 6PPD-quinone in Atlantic salmon and brown trout alevins (sac fry). These species have previously not been tested for sensitivity to 6PPD-quinone. The fish were exposed in static conditions in eight treatments with initial concentrations ranging from 0.095 to 12.16 µg/L. Fish were observed for 48 h, and changes in concentrations of 6PPD-quinone were monitored throughout the experiment. No mortalities or substantial changes in behavior were recorded in either Atlantic salmon or brown trout.

Among individual fish, we found little evidence for a relationship between congener concentrations and percent lipid; however, congener concentrations did show a generally positive relationship with salmon size. Fish and macroinvertebrate congener concentrations are clearly related, and PCB congeners biomagnify approximately 20-30-fold as they flow from macroinvertebrates, two trophic levels below salmon, to the salmon. Slopes of regressions of salmonid congener concentrations on macroinvertebrate congener concentrations within homologs indicated that the degree of biomagnification generally increased with the degree of congener chlorination, although this pattern was much stronger for Mysis than for Diporeia.

Little information is found in the international literature on PBDEs in the biotic compartment of the Southern Hemisphere. This paper reports the levels of several PBDE congeners found in the tissues of farmed fish from five different farming areas of Southern Chile. PBDEs were analyzed by HRGC-MS. More analytical data were obtained by analyzing these same pollutants in fish feed. Our results indicate a general trend of PBDE levels averaging 1.46 ng g(-1) wet weight (wwt). The observed congeneric distribution that resulted was quite similar to data previously reported in the open literature. PBDE profiles were found to be dominated by BDE 47. No correlation was observed between levels found in the tissues and the lipid content in such tissues, although a high correlation with the fish feed data was observed indicating that this could probably be the main PDBE entry source into fish, although other sources cannot be excluded. Even though the samples were obtained from different geographical areas, they presented fairly similar profiles, indicating a potential common source.

Contamination levels are normally low and consumers are probably seldom exposed to risk concentrations. No clones of L. monocytogenes seem to be specific to smoked salmon, some clones found in smoked salmon having been isolated from several sources, including patients. Cold-smoking has been shown to eliminate L. monocytogenes in challenge tests at temperatures from 17.1 to 21.1 degrees C, while from 22.2 to 30 degrees C the bacteria survived. Under natural cold-smoking conditions (19 to 22 degrees C) the frequency and level of L. monocytogenes seems to decrease. Hot-smoking seems to eliminate the bacteria when smoke is applied during the whole heating process. The prevention of recontamination of both cold-smoked and hot-smoked salmon is therefore of great importance. L. monocytogenes multiply considerably in smoked salmon during storage. Growth is faster in challenge tests than in naturally-contaminated smoked salmon. The declared shelf-life under refrigeration should be shorter than that customarily stipulated by many producers. While the sources of L. monocytogenes in smoked salmon processing plants have still to be determined, raw salmon does not seem to be an important source. The main issue for producers is to prevent colonization of the processing environment and spread of the bacteria to products. This should be achieved by the systemic implementation of hygienic measures, including the HACCP approach."

Expansion of the range of this parasite is also suggested by an increase of its geographical range in Chile, beyond its previously endemic foci in the lakes of Regions IX and X. Prevention of further dissemination of this parasitic disease rests on an improvement of sanitation and sewage disposal around the lakes of Regions IX, X and XI in Chile, improvement in aquaculture methods including curtailing the use of fish tapeworm-contaminated lakes to grow juveniles forms of salmonids and more measures to decrease the number of salmonid escapees from marine pens to prevent their return to rivers and lakes carrying the infestation. Moreover, tracking the origin of juveniles in marketed salmon, determining the presence of plerocercoids in them, and increased education of the public regarding the potential dangers of eating raw fish should also be implemented. Only by stimulating the dialogue between the industry, consumers and state regulators will it be possible to implement appropriate measures to prevent further expansion of this parasitic disease by salmon aquaculture."

Because omega 3 fatty acids in fish are recognized as having antioxidant and anti inflammatory properties found to be beneficial for good health, many consumers are looking to fish as their main source of protein. Unfortunately, contaminants such as methylmercury can accumulate in some species of fish. The purpose of this research is to test commercially available fish jerky snack foods for mercury contamination. Fifteen bags of marlin jerky, three bags of ahi jerky, and three bags of salmon jerky were purchased from large retail stores in Hawaii and California, and directly from the proprietors' Internet websites. Five individual strips of jerky per bag were analyzed for a total of one hundred and five tests. From the seventy-five marlin jerky samples, mercury concentration ranged from 0.052-28.17 μg/g, with an average of 5.53 μg/g, median 4.1 μg/g. Fifty-six (75%) marlin samples had mercury concentrations that exceeded the FDA's current mercury action level of 1.0 μg/g, while six samples had greater than 10 μg/g. Fifteen samples of ahi had mercury concentrations ranging from 0.09-0.55 μg/g, while mercury concentrations in fifteen salmon samples ranged from 0.030-0.17 μg/g. This study found that mercury concentrations in some fish jerky can often exceed the FDA's allowable mercury limit and could be a significant source of mercury exposure."

Recommended levels of (n-3) fatty acid intake, as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), may be achieved by consuming farmed or wild salmon while maintaining an acceptable level of noncarcinogenic risk. However, the recommended level of EPA+DHA intake cannot be achieved solely from farmed or wild salmon while maintaining an acceptable level of carcinogenic risk. Although the benefit-risk ratio for carcinogens and noncarcinogens is significantly greater for wild Pacific salmon than for farmed Atlantic salmon as a group, the ratio for some subgroups of farmed salmon is on par with the ratio for wild salmon.

However, young children, women of child-bearing age, pregnant women, and nursing mothers not at significant risk for sudden cardiac death associated with CHD but concerned with health impairments such as reduction in IQ and other cognitive and behavioral effects, can minimize contaminant exposure by choosing the least contaminated wild salmon or by selecting other sources of (n-3) fatty acids."

Many foods, from both plant and animal origin, have been involved in listeriosis outbreaks. This article reports the results of a 12-year survey (1993 through 2004) on the presence of L. monocytogenes in several kinds of food marketed in Italy. Of 5,788 analyzed samples, 121 (2.1%) were contaminated with L. monocytogenes. The highest prevalence was found in smoked salmon (10.6%) and in poultry meat samples (8.5%) and the lowest in red meat (0.3%). L. monocytogenes was not found in 154 samples of fresh seafood products. Fifty-two isolates were also serotyped by the agglutination method. The most common serotypes detected in the 52 strains tested were 1/2a (36.5%), followed by 1/2c (32.8%), 1/2b (13.5%), 4b (11.5%), 3a (3.8%), and 3b (1.9%). The results of the present study showed low levels of L. monocytogenes in the analyzed samples. A total of 61.5% of the 52 L. monocytogenes strains analyzed belonged to serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b, namely the serovars that are most commonly involved in extraintestinal human listeriosis outbreaks. In the ready-to-eat samples, these three serotypes were 40.0% (1/2a), 17.1% (1/2b), and 14.3% (4b). This finding highlights the need to implement strict hygienic measures during the production, distribution, and sale of foods to reduce the risk of foodborne listeriosis in humans to an acceptable level."

Three antimicrobials extensively used in Chilean salmon aquaculture (oxytetracycline, oxolinic acid, and florfenicol) were studied. Although none of these antimicrobials was detected in sediments from either site, traces of flumequine, a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial also widely used in Chile, were present in sediments from both sites during this period. There were significant increases in bacterial numbers and antimicrobial-resistant fractions to oxytetracycline, oxolinic acid, and florfenicol in sediments from the aquaculture site compared to those from the control site. Interestingly, there were similar numbers of presumably plasmid-mediated resistance genes for oxytetracycline, oxolinic acid and florfenicol in unselected marine bacteria isolated from both aquaculture and control sites.

This study aims to investigate the effect of BL on V. parahaemolyticus in culture media and in ready-to-eat fresh salmon, and to evaluate the killing effectiveness of the UF combined with BL treatment on V. parahaemolyticus. The results showed that BL irradiation at 216 J/cm2 was effective in causing cell death (close to 100%), cell shrinkage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst in V. parahaemolyticus. Application of imidazole (IMZ), an inhibitor of ROS generation, attenuated the cell death induced by BL, indicating that ROS were involved in the bactericidal effects of BL on V. parahaemolyticus. Furthermore, UF for 15 min enhanced the bactericidal effect of BL at 216 J/cm2 on V. parahaemolyticus, with the bactericidal rate of 98.81%. In addition, BL sterilization did not affect the color and quality of salmon, and the additive UF treatment for 15 min did not significant impact on the color of salmon.

We observed that the traditional population models significantly overestimate exposure and risk estimates in comparison to IBM approach when contamination of foods occurs with a low number of cells (<100 per serving). Moreover, the exposure estimates obtained with the population model were characterized by a great uncertainty. The overestimation was mainly linked to the ability of IBM to predict no growth situations rather than the consideration of microscale environment.

Aquaculture provide income for communities across the world and have a smaller carbon footprint than terrestrial animal-production systems. However, fish diseases are a constant threat, and the use of antibiotics is a source of concern due to its adverse impacts on the environment and human health. Chilean salmon farming has made several efforts to reduce the use of antibiotics for the eradication of piscirickettsiosis, a disease caused by the gram-negative bacteria Piscirickettsia salmonis. Excessive amounts of antibiotics continue to be used in Chilean aquaculture, playing an important role in the emerging public health crisis of antimicrobial resistance. Without doubt, P. salmonis is becoming increasingly resistant to important frontline antimicrobial classes, with severe implications for the future treatment of infectious human and animal diseases. Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria as well as antibiotic residues from salmon production are spreading in the environment, and thus both salmon food commodities and wild organisms can become a source of resistant bacteria that can be transmitted to humans as foodborne contaminants. This urgent threat needs to be addressed by implementing national strategies in compliance with international standards that include both prudent antimicrobial use in marine salmon farms and the investment towards a One Health approach, which combines human, animal and environmental health."

Respondents were surveyed again in 1997 to report the number of sport fish consumed by their children aged 5-10 years. Parental report revealed that 60% of children had consumed at least one sport fish meal over their lifetime. Anglers', partners', and children's variables were entered into three separate factor analysis models to assess consumption patterns. Factors for anglers and partners accounted for 65 and 59% of variance in consumption scores, respectively. Factors dealing with trout and salmon consumption accounted for the most variance. Children's factors accounted for 82% of variance in consumption scores, showing separation in relation to type of fish, body of water, and age at consumption. Children's factors were then used as dependent measures of separate multiple regression runs in which parental factors were entered stepwise as predictors. Significant associations between parental and children's factors were noted, suggesting that sport fish consumption patterns in parents are predictive of similar consumption patterns in children. Results suggest that sport fish consumption advisories do not fully prevent consumption of contaminated sport fish during childhood.

Aquatic organisms living in soft waters may be more adversely affected by fluoride pollution than those living in hard or seawaters because the bioavailability of fluoride ions is reduced with increasing water hardness. Fluoride can either inhibit or enhance the population growth of algae, depending upon fluoride concentration, exposure time and algal species. Aquatic plants seem to be effective in removing fluoride from contaminated water under laboratory and field conditions. In aquatic animals, fluoride tends to be accumulated in the exoskeleton of invertebrates and in the bone tissue of fishes. The toxic action of fluoride resides in the fact that fluoride ions act as enzymatic poisons, inhibiting enzyme activity and, ultimately, interrupting metabolic processes such as glycolysis and synthesis of proteins. Fluoride toxicity to aquatic invertebrates and fishes increases with increasing fluoride concentration, exposure time and water temperature, and decreases with increasing intraspecific body size and water content of calcium and chloride. Freshwater invertebrates and fishes, especially net-spinning caddisfly larvae and upstream-migrating adult salmons, appear to be more sensitive to fluoride toxicity than estuarine and marine animals. Because, in soft waters with low ionic content, a fluoride concentration as low as 0.5 mg F-/l can adversely affect invertebrates and fishes, safe levels below this fluoride/l concentration are recommended in order to protect freshwater animals from fluoride pollution."

This study aimed to determine the microbial safety and quality of pre-packed salads and salad bar ingredients sold in Singapore, so as to identify public health risks that could arise from consuming salads and to determine areas for improvement in the management of food safety. The most frequently encountered organism in pre-packed salad samples was B. cereus, particularly in pasta salads (33.3%, 10/30). The most commonly detected organism in salad bar ingredients was L. monocytogenes, in particular seafood ingredients (44.1%, 15/34), largely due to contaminated smoked salmon. Further investigation showed that 21.6% (37/171) of the pre-packed smoked salmon sold in supermarkets contained L. monocytogenes. Significantly higher prevalence of L. monocytogenes and higher Standard Plate Count were detected in smoked salmon at salad bars compared to pre-packed smoked salmon in supermarkets, which suggested multiplication of the organism as the products move down the supply chain. Further molecular analysis revealed that L. monocytogenes Sequence Type (ST) 2 and ST87 were present in a particular brand of pre-packed salmon products over a 4-year period, implying a potential persistent contamination problem at the manufacturing level. Our findings highlighted a need to improve manufacturing and retail hygiene processes as well as to educate vulnerable populations to avoid consuming food prone to L. monocytogenes contamination."

","Over the last decade the health and environmental research communities have made significant progress in collecting and improving access to genomic, toxicology, exposure, health, and disease data useful to health risk assessment. One of the barriers to applying these growing volumes of information in fields such as risk assessment is the lack of informatics tools to organize, curate, and evaluate thousands of journal publications and hundreds of databases to provide new insights on relationships among exposure, hazard, and disease burden. Many fields are developing ontologies as a way of organizing and analyzing large amounts of complex information from multiple scientific disciplines. Ontologies include a vocabulary of terms and concepts with defined logical relationships to each other. Building from the recently published exposure ontology and other relevant health and environmental ontologies, this article proposes an ontology for health risk assessment (RsO) that provides a structural framework for organizing risk assessment information and methods. The RsO is anchored by eight major concepts that were either identified by exploratory curations of the risk literature or the exposure-ontology working group as key for describing the risk assessment domain. These concepts are: (1) stressor, (2) receptor, (3) outcome, (4) exposure event, (5) dose-response approach, (6) dose-response metric, (7) uncertainty, and (8) measure of risk. We illustrate the utility of these concepts for the RsO with example curations of published risk assessments for ionizing radiation, arsenic in drinking water, and persistent pollutants in salmon."

In this study, the feed-to-fillet transfer of dietary PM and its main metabolites was investigated in Atlantic salmon fillet. Based on the experimental determined PM and metabolite uptake, metabolisation, and elimination kinetics, a physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) compartmental model was developed. Fish fed PM had a relatively low (~4%) PM retention and two main metabolites (2-DAMP and Desethyl-PM) were identified in liver, muscle, kidney and bile. The absence of more metabolised forms of 2-DAMP and Desethyl-PM in Atlantic salmon indicates different metabolism in cold-water fish compared to previous studies on ruminants. The model was used to simulate the long term (>1.5 years) feed-to-fillet transfer of PM + metabolite in Atlantic salmon under realistic farming conditions including seasonal fluctuations in feed intake, growth, and fat deposition in muscle tissue. The model predictions show that with the constant presence of the highest observed PM concentration in commercial salmon feed, fillet PM+ metabolite levels were approximately 5 nmol kg-1, with highest levels for the metabolite 2-DAMP.

The annual number of cases of invasive listeriosis due to cold-smoked salmon consumption in France is estimated to be 307, with a very large credible interval ([10; 12,453]), reflecting data uncertainty. This uncertainty is mainly associated with the dose-response model. Despite the significant uncertainty associated with the predictions, this model provides a scientific base for risk managers and food business operators to manage the risk linked to cold-smoked salmon contaminated with L. monocytogenes. Under the modeling assumptions, risk would be efficiently reduced through a decrease in the prevalence of L. monocytogenes or better control of the last steps of the cold chain (shorter and/or colder storage during the consumer step), whereas reduction of the initial contamination levels of the contaminated products and improvement in the first steps of the cold chain do not seem to be promising strategies.

The nine studied fish species were: Baltic fish (cod, herring, salmon), fish farmed in Poland (carp, trout), oceanic fish imported from China (walleye pollock, sole), and farmed fish imported from Vietnam and China (sutchi catfish, tilapia). The lowest lipid content (below 0.1%) was noted in the muscle tissues of Baltic cod and walleye pollock caught in the Pacific. The muscle tissue of walleye pollock also had the lowest protein content (12.2Â±2.0%). The highest lipid content was noted in the muscle tissues of Baltic salmon (13.1Â±2.4%). The highest percentage content of eicosapentaenoic (C20:5 nâ3 â EPA) and docosahexaenoic (C22:6 nâ3 â DHA) acids (over 40%) was noted in the fat extracted from the oceanic fish and Baltic cod. However, due to the low fat content, the concentrations of EPA+DHA in these fish species and in imported farmed fish expressed in mg/100g of muscle tissues are the lowest and range on average from 24.8Â±5.7mg/100g (sutchi catfish) to 207.4Â±125.4mg/100g (sole). This is why the consumption of these fish species has no significant meaning for coronary heart disease prevention. Consumers with symptoms of cardiovascular diseases should include the following fish species, which have high concentrations of EPA+DHA: Baltic salmon (3807.2Â±666.3mg/100g); Polish farmed trout (1804.0Â±279.2mg/100g); and Baltic herring (940.9Â±306.6mg/100g) in their diets.

Much of the focus has been on (anti-)estrogenic and (anti-)androgenic effects, and these effects are thought to be mediated through the estrogen (ER) and androgen (AR) receptors, respectively. The seriousness of the problem has led international bodies such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the European Union (EU) to initiate large research programs and developments toward new guidelines and regulations. EDCs have both synthetic and natural sources. The mechanisms of action of EDCs can be divided into: (1) agonistic/antagonistic effect (""hormone mimics""), (2) disruption of production, transport, metabolism, or secretion of natural hormones, and (3) disruption of production and/or function of hormone receptors. However, the number of nuclear hormone receptors being potential targets for EDCs has increased dramatically the last decade, opening up new avenues for possible endocrine disruptor effects. In studies with Atlantic salmon, data showed that 4-nonylphenol, a model xenoestrogen previously used in large volumes, for example, in paints and detergents, acts as an estrogen mimic, as a steroid metabolism disruptor, and by modulating estrogen receptor (ER) levels, indicating that one single compound exerts all of these three mechanisms, depending on the dose given to the organism. A hypothesis explaining this observation is that the nature of the effect of an EDC is determined by dose-dependent routing and cross-talk between different classes of nuclear receptors."

Juvenile salmon were exposed to waterborne TCEP or TBOEP (0.04, 0.2 and 1 mg/L) for 7 days. The muscle accumulation was measured and bioconcentration factor (BCF) was calculated, showing that TCEP was less accumulative and resistant to metabolism in salmon than TBOEP. Metabolite formations were only detected in TBOEP-exposed fish, showing seven phase I biotransformation metabolites with hydroxylation, ether cleavage or combination of both reactions as important metabolic pathways. In vitro incubation of trout S9 liver fraction with TBOEP was performed showing that the generated metabolite patterns were similar to those found in muscle tissue exposed in vivo. However, another OH-TBOEP isomer and an unidentified metabolite not present in in vivo exposure were observed with the trout S9 incubation. Overall, some of the observed metabolic products were similar to those in a previous in vitro report using human liver microsomes and some metabolites were identified for the first time in the present study. Toxicological analysis indicated that TBOEP produced less effect, although it was taken up faster and accumulated more in fish muscle than TCEP.

After cooking, levels of POPs decreased in salmon steak with an average loss of 26 +/- 15% relative to the initial POP load in the raw steak. The removal of the skin from the cooked salmon steak resulted in a further average loss of 9 +/- 3%. The loss of POPs did not differ significantly between cooking methods. Losses of POPs were significantly and linearly correlated with the losses of lipid during cooking, suggesting removal of lipids is the critical factor for POPs reduction in cooked fish.

Food adulteration may have reached its peak in cities of Western Europe and the US in the 18th and 19th centuries when foods were often purposely contaminated with additives to increase bulk, attractiveness, disguise spoilage, and increase profit. Effective regulation of food began in the late 19th and 20th centuries. Nevertheless, today food recalls for bacterial contamination are common, while pesticides and compounds from manufacturing are detected in many foods. Foods with strong reputations for healthiness, such as salmon, may have sizable contaminant contents. The contaminant content of many foods varies by origin and season. Nearly all commercially raised salmon has higher contaminant levels than wild caught salmon. Opting out of the commercial food distribution system is an option, but the value depends on the habitat in which the food is obtained. Traditionally, the Akwesasne Mohawk Nation has depended on local fish and wildlife for their diet. Now pollution of local waterways has led to the contamination of many local foods, and levels of the contaminant polychlorinated biphenyls in the Akwesasne Mohawk people reflect current or past dietary patterns. Many other communities in nonurban settings are exposed to contaminants through long-trail distribution of contaminants in food, air, and/or water.

Listeriosis in humans manifests primarily as septicemia, meningitis, encephalitis, gastrointestinal infection, and abortion.

Consumer lifestyle has changed, and less time is available for food preparation. Modern lifestyle has markedly changed eating habits worldwide, with a consequent increased demand for RTE foods; therefore, more RTE and take away foods are consumed. There is a concern that many Listeria outbreaks are reported from hospitals. Therefore, it is vitally important that foods (especially cooked and chilled) delivered to hospitals and residential homes for senior citizens and elderly people are reheated to at least 72°C: cold food, such as turkey deli meat and cold-smoked and gravad salmon should be free from L. monocytogenes.

The model is assessed from experimental uptake and elimination kinetics of Atlantic salmon smolt fed with technical toxaphene for 122 days followed by a depuration period of 75 days in which the fish were fed toxaphene-free control feed. The serial one-compartment model shows that about 31% of CHB-44 that accumulated in the fillet originated from dietary CHB-62. In contrast, dechlorination of CHB-50 into CHB-40 is not significant. The results show that previously demonstrated in vivo dechlorination of CHB-62 into CHB-44 in zebra fish also occurs in the farmed fish species Atlantic salmon. This dechlorination can at least partly explain the relatively elevated CHB-44 observed in toxaphene fish surveys."

The goal of fish advisories is to reduce fish consumption even further, which shifts the burden of avoiding risk to the very people who already bear the burdens of contaminant exposure, socio-economic impacts and cultural loss. However, because Tribal communities often do not have the choice of giving up more food, income, religion, culture, and heritage in order to avoid contamination, they are forced into choosing between culture and health. Many tribal members choose to incur chemical risk rather than giving up their culture and religion.

Additional models based on 90 portions of salmon were developed to predict moisture (r² = 0.98, RMSECV = 1.02, RPD = 7), protein (r² = 0.96, RMSECV = 0.347, RPD = 5.08), fat (r² = 0.99, RMSECV = 1.09, RPD = 5.98) and ash (r² = 0.72, RMSECV = 0.05, RPD = 1.9). The predictive FT‐NIRs and reference methods were tested for short‐term and intermediate precision, which demonstrated that the repeatability of the predictive models was comparable to the reference methods. Proximate analysis of GSM and king salmon using FT‐NIRs was quick (minutes for sample preparation and analysis rather than days) and all components were assessed simultaneously. This provides a low‐cost short turn‐around method suitable for industry and research applications."

WQS for the protection of human health whose derivation is based in part on anadromous fish, create the expectation that implementation of these WQS will lead to lower contaminant levels in returning adult fish. Whether this expectation can be met is likely a function of where and when such fish are exposed. Various exposure scenarios have been advanced to explain acquisition of bioaccumulative contaminants by Pacific salmonids. This study examined 16 different scenarios with bioenergetics and toxicokinetic models to identify those where WQS might be effective in reducing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)--a representative bioaccumulative contaminant--in returning adult Fall chinook salmon, a representative salmonid. Model estimates of tissue concentrations and body burdens in juveniles and adults were corroborated with observations reported in the literature. Model results suggest that WQS may effect limited (< approximately 2 ×) reductions in PCB levels in adults who were resident in a confined marine water body or who transited a highly contaminated estuary as out-migrating juveniles. In all other scenarios examined, WQS would have little effect on PCB levels in returning adults. Although the results of any modeling study must be interpreted with caution and are not necessarily applicable to all salmonid species, they do suggest that the ability of WQS to meet the expectation of reducing contaminant loadings in anadromous species is limited."

Although significant statistical associations between polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) body burdens and these negative outcomes suggest that PCBs may be responsible, the fetus and neonate are also exposed to other fish-borne neurotoxicants. In this manuscript we present data from two developmental studies that support the hypothesis that PCBs may serve either as a marker for other contaminants that are responsible for the observed effects, or that other contaminants present in the fish interact synergistically with the PCBs to produce the observed neurotoxicity. In the first study we demonstrated that exposure of rats to diets containing lyophilized Great Lakes salmon, resulting in exposure to as little as 13.9 micrograms/(kg small middle dotday) of total PCBs, induced significant reductions in regional brain dopamine (DA) concentrations. In the second study, we demonstrated that exposure of rats to the ortho-substituted PCB congener (2,4,2', 4'-tetrachloro- biphenyl) at 1, 10 or 20 mg/(kg small middle dotday) also induced significant reductions in DA concentrations in the same brain regions although only at the two highest doses-levels at least 100-fold higher than seen in the first study. On the basis of these developmental neurochemical studies we suggest that the reported cognitive deficits in children exposed in utero and during lactation to fish-borne contaminants may be due either to contaminants other than PCBs or to complex interactions between PCBs and other neurotoxicants present in the fish."

Major sources of POPs are animal fats including fatty fish. Given the putative protective effects of fish on cardiovascular disease, we explored whether high consumption of fatty fish increased serum concentrations of POPs. METHODS AND RESULTS:Men and women aged 35-70 years with body mass index between 25 and 38 kg/m2 and at least 1 cardiometabolic component were randomized to high intakes of fatty fish (mostly farmed salmon, ∼630 g/week; n = 45), high intakes of nuts (∼200 g/week; n = 42) or a control group following their usual diet but restricting fatty fish and nuts for 6 months (n = 44). Concentrations of 15 POPs (5 organochlorinated compounds, 2 dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls and 8 non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls) and cardiometabolic risk factors were measured at baseline and end of the study. Results showed that changes in concentrations of individual and classes of POPs did not differ between the dietary groups and controls (p > 0.05). Among cardiometabolic risk factors HDL-cholesterol increased in the fatty fish group compared to controls (+0.10 mmol/L, CI (0.05-0.20); p = 0.005) while no changes were observed in the group consuming nuts. CONCLUSION:Fatty fish consumption for 6 months did not increase the serum concentrations of POPs in individuals with overweight or obesity and metabolic risk. While this finding appears reassuring regarding short-term intakes of farmed salmon, long term variations in POPs in adipose stores require further study."

The 134Cs and 137Cs concentrations in six salmonids exhibited lower temporal variations for three years after the F1NPP accident, suggesting that these radionuclides are widely distributed and these radionuclides remain in the natural environment globally with less convergence. The accumulation patterns were significantly different among the different salmon species.

Recently, epidemiological studies have associated the prevalence of type 2 diabetes with elevated body burdens of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). However, experimental evidence demonstrating a causal link between POPs and the development of insulin resistance is lacking. We investigated whether exposure to POPs contributes to insulin resistance and metabolic disorders. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed for 28 days to lipophilic POPs through the consumption of a high-fat diet containing either refined or crude fish oil obtained from farmed Atlantic salmon. In addition, differentiated adipocytes were exposed to several POP mixtures that mimicked the relative abundance of organic pollutants present in crude salmon oil. We measured body weight, whole-body insulin sensitivity, POP accumulation, lipid and glucose homeostasis, and gene expression and we performed microarray analysis. Adult male rats exposed to crude, but not refined, salmon oil developed insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, and hepatosteatosis. The contribution of POPs to insulin resistance was confirmed in cultured adipocytes where POPs, especially organochlorine pesticides, led to robust inhibition of insulin action. Moreover, POPs induced down-regulation of insulin-induced gene-1 (Insig-1) and Lpin1, two master regulators of lipid homeostasis. Our findings provide evidence that exposure to POPs commonly present in food chains leads to insulin resistance and associated metabolic disorders."

In this study, we compared measured stream water concentrations from 2 monitoring studies conducted in the Pacific Northwest with concentration-response curves derived for inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase activity in juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) for mixtures of organophosphate (OPs) and carbamate (CBs) pesticides. In the first monitoring study, samples were collected from 2003 to 2007 in salmonid-bearing waters of 5 urban or agricultural watersheds in Washington State. This study was targeted to areas of high pesticide use and generally involved weekly sampling during the pesticide use season. The second monitoring study was the United States Geological Survey National Water Quality Assessment that included samples taken from 2003 to 2010 in California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. OPs and CBs were frequently detected in both studies. The available monitoring data collected since 2003, however, demonstrates that mixtures of OPs and CBs in surface waters rarely occur at levels capable of producing significant physiological and behavioral effects in Pacific salmon.

Therefore, germfree mice were infected with O157 to examine the resuscitation of cells in the VNC state and the retention of pathogenicity. O157 that originated in roe, but not patients, killed mice and was isolated from the intestine. However, these isolates had become sensitive to NaCl. O157 cells of roe origin incubated in normal media also killed mice and were isolated from the intestine, but they also became transiently NaCl sensitive. We therefore propose that bacterial cells might enter the VNC state under conditions of stress, such as those encountered in vivo or in high salt concentrations, and then revive when those conditions have eased. If so, the VNC state in food is potentially dangerous from a public health viewpoint and may have to be considered at the time of food inspection. Finally, the establishment of a simple recovery system for VNC cells should be established."

However, fish are also the primary source of methylmercury exposure in humans. Selenium often co-occurs with mercury and there is some evidence that selenium can protect against mercury toxicity yet States issue fish consumption advisories based solely on the risks that methylmercury pose to human health. Recently, it has been suggested the selenium: mercury molar ratio be considered in risk management. In order for agencies to utilize the ratio to set consumption guidelines, it is important to evaluate the variability in selenium and mercury in different fish species. We examined 10 different freshwater fish species found within the Columbia River Basin in order to determine the inter- and intra-specific variability in the selenium: mercury molar ratios and the selenium health benefit values. We found significant variation in selenium: mercury molar ratios. The mean molar ratios for each species were all above 1:1, ranging from 3.42:1 in Walleye to 27.2:1 in Chinook salmon. There was a positive correlation between both mercury and selenium with length for each fish species apart from yellow perch and rainbow trout. All species had health benefit values greater than 2. We observed considerable variability in selenium: mercury molar ratios within fish species collected in the Columbia River Basin. Although incorporating selenium: mercury molar ratios into fish consumption holds the potential for refining advisories and assessing the risk of methylmercury exposure, the current understanding of how these ratios apply is insufficient, and further understanding of drivers of variability in the ratios is needed."

LA and FA processing approaches relied on production (LA) or addition (FA) of organic acids to lower the pH and activate the inherent proteases in these tissues, whereas FL processing was carried out at the optimum conditions for Flavourzyme (37 °C, pH 7.0). Highest protein hydrolysate fraction recovery (∼57%) was seen in LA fermentation, while FA processing resulted in the highest protein levels (∼87%) in the recovered hydrolysate fraction and lowest residual fraction (∼4%). In general, FL processing demonstrated higher Fe(II) chelation (73%) and ferric reducing capacity (27 mM glutathione equivalent) whereas LA‐hydrolysates showed enhanced sacrificial antioxidant properties. Findings from this study would have implications on the application and production of salmon‐based protein hydrolysates, especially, from the perspective of their functionality. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Peptides derived from natural sources such as fish products have been extensively reported to exert antioxidant activity that mitigates oxidative stress and providing beneficial effects to human health as well as food storage. Several sources of proteins are being explored for the production of biologically active peptides. Utilizing by‐product streams such as fish processing waste is especially attractive as these are cheaper and rich sources of protein. Therefore, utilizing marine bioprocessing waste for the production food‐grade protein hydrolysates is promising, especially in Atlantic Canada."

A number of different methods for the detection of A. simplex in fish and products thereof have been developed, including visual techniques and PCR for larvae tracing, and immunological assays for the determination of proteins. The recent identification of a number of anisakid proteins by mass spectrometry-based proteomics has laid the groundwork for the development of two quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods for the detection of A. simplex in fish that are described in the present study. Both, the label-free semi-quantitative nLC-nESI-Orbitrap-MS/MS (MS1) and the heavy peptide-applying absolute-quantitative (AQUA) LC-TripleQ-MS/MS (MS2) use unique reporter peptides derived from anisakid hemoglobin and SXP/RAL-2 protein as analytes. Standard curves in buffer and in salmon matrix showed limits of detection at 1μg/mL and 10μg/mL for MS1 and 0.1μg/mL and 2μg/mL for MS2. Preliminary method validation included the assessment of sensitivity, repeatability, reproducibility, and applicability to incurred and naturally-contaminated samples for both assays. By further optimization and full validation in accordance with current recommendations the LC-MS/MS methods could be standardized and used generally as confirmative techniques for the detection of A. simplex protein in fish."

We apply a quantitative risk-benefit analysis for eight freshwater, saltwater and anadromous fish species, using dose-response relationships to weigh the risks of MeHg bioaccumulation against the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) toward cardiovascular and neurodevelopmental health endpoints. Findings suggests that consumption of many of the fish species reviewed here, including northern pike, Pacific Halibut, and arctic grayling, may lead to increased risk of coronary heart disease and declines in infant visual recognition memory. However, we also identify significant variation among regions, among studies within the same region, and also within studies, which make it difficult to craft consistent consumption advice. Whereas salmon consistently shows a net-benefit, for instance, data for arctic grayling, pike, sablefish, and some halibut are all too imprecise to provide consistent recommendations. We argue for more detailed local-scale monitoring, and identification of possible thresholds for increased risk in the future.

Macroinvertebrate communities and fish populations were little affected at the downstream contaminated sites where concentrations of Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd were 0.1-1.5 times higher than water-quality criteria established by the U.

Our data suggest that lineages adapt similarly to these inhibitors, as the only significant growth parameter difference between lineages was a minor effect (+/- 0.16 day, P = 0.0499) on lag phase (lambda). For all strains, lactate significantly extended lambda, from 2.6 +/- 0.4 to 3.8 +/- 0.5 days (P < 0.001), and lowered the maximum growth rate (mu(max)) from 0.54 +/- 0.06 to 0.49 +/- 0.04 log(CFU/ml)/day (P < 0.001), compared with the control. Diacetate was ineffective alone, but in combination with lactate, synergistically increased lambda to 6.6 +/- 1.6 days (P < 0.001) and decreased mu(max) to 0.34 +/- 0.05 log(CFU/ml)/day (P < 0.001). Monte Carlo simulations provided further evidence for synergy between diacetate and lactate by predicting signficantly slower growth to nominal endpoints for the combination of inhibitors. This study shows potassium lactate and sodium diacetate have significant synergistic effects on both lambda and mu(max) of L. monocytogenes at refrigeration temperature in broth, and justifies combining these inhibitors, at effective levels, in food product formulations."

Because eating fish is the primary mechanism of MeHg exposure, federal and state agencies issue fish consumption advisories to inform the public about the risks of eating contaminated fish. An advisory's purpose is to provide information to consumers to increase their knowledge of specific product attributes; however, the difficulty in communicating both the risks and benefits of eating fish leads readers of fish advisories to over-restrict their fish consumption. Because the effectiveness of fish consumption advisories are not often evaluated by states, we help fill this gap by evaluating the effectiveness of Maine's fish consumption advisory in terms of improving knowledge. The results suggest the advisory successfully increased women's knowledge of both the benefits and risks of consuming fish while pregnant. The advisory also increased their ability to differentiate fish by their MeHg content, knowledge of both low and high-MeHg fish and knowledge of detailed attributes of seemingly substitutable goods, such as white tuna, light tuna and pre-packaged salmon. People who did not read the advisory lack the knowledge of how to identify fish that provide: health benefits like Omega-3 fatty acids, or health risks like MeHg; reading the advisory reduces this lack of knowledge. Readers increased ability to make specific substitutions to minimize risk while maintaining the benefits of fish eating suggests the advisory has the potential of reducing MeHg-related health risks while avoiding the drop in fish consumption show in other studies."

The objective of the present study was to develop a spreadsheet tool for aquaculture farm-food safety and diseases risk assessment (AquaFRAM) for salmon farms in the UK, (and possibly more widely) to encourage farms to assess potential hazards and diseases. AquaFRAM functions primarily as a self-assessment risk ranking and risk-learning tool to determine the potential of farm food safety hazards, diseases and the level of possible risk for contamination and infections. AquaFRAM has been developed using MS Excel software utilising a qualitative risk assessment approach for farmers to evaluate their food safety practices and diseases on their farms. The risk assessment is based on the risk matrix of frequency of likelihood×severity, where the farmers can judge the likelihood of the hazards occurring on their farm based on given examples or scenarios. Grounding of the model, based on severity scoring is predicated on relevant reports in the literature and expert opinion derived from a separate Delphi study. The AquaFRAM Tool has since been tested on 9 salmon companies throughout UK. All of the farms which tried and tested the AquaFRAM Tool reported it being farmer-friendly and practical. It was highlighted that the current tool focused mainly on risk reduction and not risk elimination. However, such farm food safety and diseases risk assessment tool would be helpful, and certainly timely, to further encourage farms to assess potential hazards and diseases. It is also appropriate for educational and training of full-time and seasonal farm workers."

We investigated whether these advisories, which typically neglect the existence of a mixture of chemicals and their possible additive adverse effects, are adequately protective of the health of humans consuming fish from the Canadian waters of the Great Lakes. Using recent fish contaminant monitoring data collected by the government of Ontario, Canada, we simulated advisories using most-restrictive-contaminant (one-chem) and multi-contaminant additive effect (multi-chem) approaches. The advisories from the two simulations were compared to determine if there is any deficiency in the currently issued advisories. Approximately half of the advisories currently issued are potentially not adequately protective. Of the four Great Lakes studied, the highest percentage of advisories affected are in Lake Ontario if an additive effect is considered. Many fish that are popular for consumption, such as walleye, salmon, bass and trout, would have noticeably more stringent advisories. Improvements in the advisories may be needed to ensure that the health of humans consuming fish from the Great Lakes is protected. In this region, total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury are the major contaminants causing restrictions on consuming fish, whereas dioxins/furans, toxaphene, and mirex/photomirex are of minor concern.

The aim of our investigation was the identification and analysis of listeriosis outbreaks in Germany with smoked and graved salmon products as the most likely source of infection using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and patient interviews. In a national surveillance programme, WGS was used for subtyping and core genome multi locus sequence typing (cgMLST) for cluster detection of L. monocytogenes isolates from listeriosis cases as well as food and environmental samples in Germany. Patient interviews were conducted to complement the molecular typing. We identified 22 independent listeriosis outbreaks occurring between 2010 and 2021 that were most likely associated with the consumption of smoked and graved salmon products. In Germany, 228 cases were identified, of 50 deaths (22%) reported 17 were confirmed to have died from listeriosis. Many of these 22 outbreaks were cross-border outbreaks with further cases in other countries. This report shows that smoked and graved salmon products contaminated with L. monocytogenes pose a serious risk for listeriosis infection in Germany. Interdisciplinary efforts including WGS and epidemiological investigations were essential to identifying the source of infection. Uncooked salmon products are high-risk foods frequently contaminated with L. monocytogenes. In order to minimize the risk of infection for consumers, food producers need to improve hygiene measures and reduce the entry of pathogens into food processing. Furthermore, susceptible individuals should be better informed of the risk of acquiring listeriosis from consuming smoked and graved salmon products."

On the other hand, dioxins are ubiquitous persistent contaminants, some being carcinogens at high doses, and therefore of great concern. Our aim was to (a) quantitatively analyze the two pollutant health risks and (b) study the changes in risk in view of the current and forthcoming EU legislations on pollutants. We performed a comparative risk assessment for both pollutants in the Helsinki metropolitan area (Finland) and estimated the health effects with several scenarios. For primary fine particles: a comparison between the present emission situation for heavy-duty vehicles and the new fine particle emission standards set by the EU. For dioxins: an EU directive that regulates commercial fishing of Baltic salmon and herring that exceed the dioxin concentration limit set for fish meat, and a derogation (= exemption) from the directive for these two species. Both of these two decisions are very topical issues and this study estimates the expected changes in health effects due to these regulations. It was found that the estimated fine particle risk clearly outweighed the estimated dioxin risk. A substantial improvement to public health could be achieved by initiating reductions in emission standards; about 30 avoided premature deaths annually in the study area.

In light of the recently outlined National Plan Against Antimicrobial Resistance in Chile, our findings on antimicrobial use in salmon aquaculture and their impact on the environment and human health are highly relevant. Ninety-five percent of tetracyclines, phenicols and quinolones imported into Chile between 1998 and 2015 were for veterinary use, mostly in salmon aquaculture. Excessive use of antimicrobials at aquaculture sites was associated with antimicrobial residues in marine sediments 8 km distant and the presence of resistant marine bacteria harboring easily transmissible resistance genes, in mobile genetic elements, to these same antimicrobials. Moreover, quinolone and integron resistance genes in human pathogens isolated from patients in coastal regions adjacent to aquaculture sites were identical to genes isolated from regional marine bacteria, consistent with genetic communication between bacteria in these different environments. Passage of antimicrobials into the marine environment can potentially diminish environmental diversity, contaminate wild fish for human consumption, and facilitate the appearance of harmful algal blooms and resistant zoonotic and human pathogens. Our findings suggest that changes in aquaculture in Chile that prevent fish infections and decrease antimicrobial usage will prove a determining factor in preventing human and animal infections with multiply-resistant ARB in accord with the modern paradigm of One Health."

In the present study, an exploratory zebrafish feeding trial using feed containing 20 percent of processed larvae of the marine fish parasite Anisakis simplex was performed as a proof-of-principle experiment. After a 2-week exposure period, anisakid peptides were detected in zebrafish tissue by high-resolution liquid-chromatography Orbitrap mass spectrometry and immunostaining using specific polyclonal antibodies or sera from patients with confirmed allergy to A. simplex. Since fishmeal produced from marine pelagic fish is an important feed component in the culture of Atlantic salmon and in the poultry industry, it should be considered as a source of potentially allergenic peptides in the final products. Furthermore, the substitution of fishmeal with plant proteins would not eliminate the potential health risk by allergen carry-over since crops of high nutritional value such as legumes also contain important food allergens. If our preliminary results from the present zebrafish feeding trial should be confirmed in necessary follow-up experiments, the question of labeling information on fish and animal food products raised on feed containing potentially allergenic ingredients could arise in order to minimize the exposure risk of allergic consumers."

Conversely, some carcinogenic contaminants are also stored in the adipose tissue of fish. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the potential health benefits and risks related to the consumption of fish or fish oil. Health benefits related to the consumption of fish or omega-3 PUFAs were obtained by an extensive literature search. Potential health risks related to carcinogenic contaminants (e. g. , dioxin, PCB, etc. ) in fish were estimated using the U. S. EPA-approved cancer risk assessment guidelines. Potential health risk estimates were evaluated by comparing them with the acceptable excess risk level of 10(-6)-10(-4). Scientific data indicate that the consumption of fish or fish oil containing omega-3 PUFAs reduces the risk of coronary heart disease, decreases mild hypertension, and prevents certain cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. Risk estimates in humans for carcinogenic environmental contaminants in fish ranged from an excess risk level of 3x10(-6)-9x10(-4). These risk estimates appeared to meet the acceptable excess risk level criteria. Therefore, consumption of fish in accordance with the State of Michigan Fish Advisory Guidelines is safe and should be encouraged. The top 11 fish species [e. g. , sardines, mackerel, herring (Atlantic and Pacific), lake trout, salmon (Chinook, Atlantic, and Sockeye), anchovy (European), sablefish, and bluefish] provide an adequate amount of omega-3 PUFAs (2.7-7.5g/meal) and appear to meet the nutritional recommendation of the American Heart Association."

To examine the impacts of long-term and continuous dietary exposure to an organophosphorus pesticide found in Atlantic salmon feed, we fed juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), an abundant species around North Atlantic fish farms, three concentrations (0.5, 4.2, and 23.2 mg/kg) of chlorpyrifos-methyl (CPM) for 30 days. Endpoints included liver and bile bioaccumulation, liver transcriptomics and metabolomics, as well as plasma cholinesterase activity, cortisol, liver 7-ethoxyresor-ufin-O-deethylase activity, and hypoxia tolerance. The results show that Atlantic cod can accumulate relatively high levels of CPM in liver after continuous exposure, which is then metabolized and excreted via the bile. All three exposure concentrations lead to significant inhibition of plasma cholinesterase activity, the primary target of CPM. Transcriptomics profiling pointed to effects on cholesterol and steroid biosynthesis. Metabolite profiling revealed that CPM induced responses reflecting detoxification by glutathione-S-transferase, inhibition of monoacylglycerol lipase, potential inhibition of carboxylesterase, and increased demand for ATP, followed by secondary inflammatory responses. A gradual hypoxia challenge test showed that all groups of exposed fish were less tolerant to low oxygen saturation than the controls. In conclusion, this study suggests that wild fish continuously feeding on leftover pellets near fish farms over time may be vulnerable to organophosphorus pesticides."

In this paper, a liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) screening method using a quadrupole-Orbitrap instrument was applied to the analysis of veterinary drug residues in incurred tissues from aquacultured channel catfish, rainbow trout, and Atlantic salmon and imported aquacultured products including European eel, yellow croaker, and tilapia. Compared to traditional MS methods, the use of HRMS with nontargeted data acquisition and exact mass measurement capability greatly increased the scope of compounds that could be monitored simultaneously. The fish samples were prepared for analysis using a simple efficient procedure that consisted of an acidic acetonitrile extraction followed by solid phase extraction cleanup. Two different HRMS acquisition programs were used to analyze the fish extracts. This method detected and identified veterinary drugs including quinolones, fluoroquinolones, avermectins, dyes, and aminopenicillins at residue levels in fish that had been dosed with those compounds. A metabolite of amoxicillin, amoxicillin diketone, was also found at high levels in catfish, trout, and salmon. The method was also used to characterize drug residues in imported fish. In addition to confirming findings of fluoroquinolone and sulfonamide residues that were found by traditional targeted MS methods, several new compounds including 2-amino mebendazole in eel and ofloxacin in croaker were detected and identified.

Fish, especially tuna, salmon, mackerel, saithe/coalfish and cod were largely the main contributors (38%) to the total organotin exposure.

Three strains of L. monocytogenes (10⁶ cfu/g) were inoculated on fresh-cut salmon and stored (4C and 25C) for 2 weeks. The effect of clove oil (1% and 2%) on the growth of cells was determined. The results proved that all strains survived and grew at 4C and 25C. In addition, we noted that the growth was inhibited under storage conditions in the presence of clove oil (1% or 2%). Listeria counts in treated samples were 1-4 log₁₀ cfu/g less compared with controls at different intervals during storage. The results revealed the potential of clove oil as a natural preservative in fresh salmon. Listeria monocytogenes continues to be a significant threat to the safety of the food supply. It was isolated from a variety of foods and ready-to-eat products and generated a serious public health problem. Because of its growth capacity at refrigerating temperatures and its survival in diverse environments, the control of L. monocytogenes is becoming a challenge. Several agents were used to suppressing contamination by L. monocytogenes, such as the addition of biopreservatives and essential oil. Spices and herbs are commonly used in food preservation because they do not have a strong effect on food quality unlike chemical and synthetic compounds. Clove oil, contains eugenol which when tested on various agar media, has antimicrobial properties, and it was able to restrict the proliferation of L. monocytogenes in food products. For this reason, clove oil has good potential as an antilisterial substance in food preservation as it may be more acceptable to consumers."

In the current study, we investigated the effects of cadmium (Cd) on salmon olfactory function by modeling an exposure scenario where juvenile salmon transiently migrate through a polluted waterway. Coho were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of waterborne Cd (2 and 30 µg/L) for 48 h and (0.3 and 2 μg/L) for 16 days, followed by a 16-day depuration associated with outmigration. Cadmium exposures inhibited behavioral responses towards L-cysteine and conspecific odorants, with effects persisting following the depuration. Behavioral alterations following the 30 µg/L exposure were associated with increased olfactory epithelial gene expression of metallothionein (mt1a) and heme oxygenase (hmox1); reduced expression of olfactory signal transduction (OST) molecules; and reduced expression of mRNAs encoding major coho odorant receptors (ORs). Salmon OR array analysis indicated that Cd preferentially impacted expression of OST and OR markers for ciliated olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) relative to microvillus OSNs, suggesting a differential sensitivity of these two major OSN populations. Behavioral alterations on exposure to 0.3 and 2 µg/L Cd were associated with increased mt1a, but not with major histological or OR molecular changes, likely indicating disrupted OST as a major mechanism underlying the behavioral dysfunction at the low-level Cd exposures. Laser-ablation mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the OSN injury and behavioral dysfunction was associated with significant Cd bioaccumulation within the olfactory sensory epithelium. In summary, low-level Cd exposures associated with polluted waterways can induce differential and persistent olfactory dysfunction in juvenile coho salmon."

Afterwards, the simulated intestinal fluids (containing pepsin, mucine, trypsin, pancreatin, bile) were added and the mixture shaken for a further 6 h prior to centrifugation and filtration using Buchner funnels to separate the undigested GI residues from GI fluids. PCBs were recovered from GI residues and fluids by Soxhlet and liquid-liquid extraction respectively, cleaned up using silica-SFE, and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry detection (GC-MSD). Detailed studies with fish indicate variations in mobilization and bioavailability of Sigma PCBs (28, 52, 101, 118, 153, 138 and 180). For example, the bioavailable fractions (fractions mobilized) in mackerel, salmon, crab and prawn were 0.77, 0.60, 0.54, and 0.72 respectively of the Sigma PCBs initially present in these food samples. The bioavailable fraction was dependent on the physicochemical characteristics of the PCBs. In mackerel bioavailable fractions for individual PCB congeners ranged from 0.47-0.82, from 0.30-0.70 in salmon, 0.44-0.64 in crab and in prawn from 0.47-0.77.

Daidzein (DAI), genistein (GEN) and glycitein (GLY) are major soy isoflavones with considerable estrogenic activities, potentially interfering with the piscine endocrine system and affecting consumers after carry-over. In this context, information on isoflavone biotransformation in fish is crucial for risk evaluation. We have therefore isolated hepatic fractions of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), the most important species in Norwegian aquaculture, and used them to study isoflavone elimination and metabolite formation. The salmon liver microsomes and primary hepatocytes were characterized with respect to phase I cytochrome P450 (CYP) and phase II uridine-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzyme activities using specific probe substrates, which allowed comparison to results in other species.

In contrast, the production of oxidative metabolites by CYP was insignificant. Under optimized assay conditions, only small amounts of mono-hydroxylated DAI were detectable.

Here, we describe a coupled bioenergetics-bioaccumulation model parameterized using empirical and literature-sourced data to predict the dual effect of Pacific salmon on stream-resident brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) growth and contaminant bioaccumulation. Within the model, we developed four unique scenarios to ascertain how the (1) trophic pathway to contamination, (2) level of salmon egg consumption, (3) intensity and duration of salmon exposure, and (4) age of first exposure to salmon, affected growth and contaminant bioaccumulation in brook trout. Our model demonstrated that salmon egg consumption increased brook trout growth and PCB bioaccumulation while reducing Hg tissue concentrations. Other trophic pathways, including direct carcass consumption and an indirect food web pathway, did not strongly influence growth or contaminant bioaccumulation. Our model also demonstrated that variation in the magnitude and temporal duration of salmon egg consumption mostly strongly influenced the growth and contaminant concentration of younger brook trout. Overall, our model highlighted that Pacific salmon transfer energy and contaminants but this balance is dictated by the food web pathway and plasticity in the diet of stream-resident fish.

The model was used to simulate the long-term (>16 months) LCV and LMG feed-to-fillet transfer in Atlantic salmon under realistic farming conditions such as the seasonal fluctuations in feed intake, growth and fillet fat deposition. The model predictions gave highest expected LCV and LMG fillet concentrations of approximately 0.12 and 0.45 μg kg-1, depending on the dietary levels of ABP and background level of LCV and LMG contamination. These levels are under the reference point for action of 2 µg kg-1 for the sum of MG and LMG that EFSA assessed as adequate to protect public health. However, for LCV, the predicted highest levels exceed the analytical decision limit (CCα) of 0.15 µg kg-1 for the method used in this paper."

Method R detected more positive samples of smoked salmon and herb-flavored slices of smoked salmon than did method B, whereas the reverse was true for samples of carpaccio-like salmon, herb-flavored slices of raw salmon, and smoked trout.

L. monocytogenes was isolated from 151 (27.8%) of the 543 samples, with concentrations mostly below 100 CFU/g. The pathogen prevalence and concentration in these seafood products varied greatly depending on the producer and the nature of the product. In certain cases, these differences could be explained by problems in cleaning and disinfection operations in the food-processing environment. The identities of L. monocytogenes isolates were confirmed by PCR, and isolates were characterized by random amplification of polymorphic DNA and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). PFGE patterns obtained with the enzymes Apal and AscI produced 26 different pulsotypes. In general, different pulsotypes were present in the different categories of seafood products and were not specific to one producer. The genetic diversity observed in the products was not related to the prevalence found at the manufacturing site. It is therefore important for producers to determine the source(s) of contamination of their product so the risks linked to the presence of L. monocytogenes can be reduced."

In order to gain knowledge about the toxicological effects of PBDEs in fish, microarray-based transcriptomic and 2D-DIGE/MALDI-TOF/TOF proteomic approaches were used to screen for effects in primary Atlantic salmon hepatocytes exposed to these congeners alone or in combination (PBDE-MIX). A small set of stress related transcripts and proteins were differentially expressed in the PBDE exposed hepatocytes. The PBDE-MIX, and BDE153 to a lesser degree, seems to have induced metabolic disturbances by affecting several pathways related to glucose homeostasis. Further, effects on cell cycle control and proliferation signal pathways in PBDE-MIX-exposed hepatocytes clearly suggest that the PBDE exposure affected cell proliferation processes. CYP1A was 7.41- and 7.37-fold up-regulated in hepatocytes exposed to BDE47 and PBDE-MIX, respectively, and was the only biotransformation pathway affected by the PBDE exposure. The factorial design and PLS regression analyses of the effect of the PBDE-MIX indicated that BDE47 contributed the most to the observed CYP1A response, suggesting that this congener should be incorporated in the toxic equivalent (TEQ) concept in future risk assessment of dioxin-like chemicals. Additionally, a significant up-regulation of the ER-responsive genes VTG and ZP3 was observed in cells exposed to BDE47 and PBDE-MIX. Further analyses suggested that BDE47 and BDE154 have an estrogenic effect in male fish. The data also suggested an antagonistic interaction between BDE153 and BDE154. In conclusion, this study shows that PBDEs can affect several biological systems in Atlantic salmon cells, and demonstrates the need for more studies on the simultaneous exposure to chemical mixtures to identify combined effects of chemicals."

When spoilage is detected, it is assumed that consumers will reject the product for consumption. Because sensory panels of trained individuals or consumers are expensive and labor intensive, identification of microbiological or chemical indicators to characterize the extent to which fish has spoiled is needed when experimental process and storage treatments are being evaluated. A consumer panel of 53 senior citizens (60 to 85 years of age) evaluated in duplicate raw salmon subjected to 10 storage conditions, and the fish quality was targeted to range from fresh to very spoiled. This population group was chosen because they would be expected to have a greater prevalence of olfactory impairments and higher odor thresholds than the general population; in turn, a shorter safety margin or time period between product rejection due to spoilage and the generation of Clostridium botulinum toxins would be likely. Low hedonic scores for aroma and overall acceptance (2 or 3 of 9), corresponding to ""dislike very much"" to ""dislike moderately,"" did not equate with unwillingness to prepare the sample for consumption by up to seven panelists (13%) when the product was presumed to have already been purchased. Despite these outliers, significant models (P = 0.0000) were developed for the willingness of consumers to prepare the sample for consumption and the sample's aerobic and anaerobic microbiological populations and two volatile peaks with Kovats indices of 640 and 753. However, these models revealed that the levels of microbiological and chemical markers must be very high before some consumers would reject the sample; hence, spoilage detection by smell would likely not be an adequate safeguard against consuming salmon in which C. botulinum toxin had been generated."

Analysis was conducted in selected reaction monitoring mode using piromidic acid as internal standard. Six-point calibration curves for each compound in extracted matrix were linear with r(2) correlation greater than 0.99. The method was validated by analyzing 23 negative samples and 116 fortified samples at concentrations of 10, 20, 50, 100, and 600 ng/g. Average recoveries of fortified samples were greater than 77% with method detection levels ranging from 2 to 7 /g. Three product ion transitions were acquired per analyte to identify each residue.

The IM was produced from Black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae fed media containing 60% seaweed (Ascophyllum nodosum). After 16 weeks of feeding, fish fillet samples were collected. The concentrations of undesirable substances, e. g. , heavy metals, arsenic, dioxins, mycotoxins, pesticides, in the IM, the diets and fillets were determined. The concentrations of the analysed compounds in the IM were all below EU maximum levels for feed ingredients, except for arsenic. However, for complete feeds the concentrations of these compounds in the feeds, including arsenic, were all below EU MLs. Arsenic was transferred from seaweed to IM, resulting in arsenic levels in IM similar to what has been documented for FM. Transfer of arsenic from feed to fillet was observed; however, total arsenic concentrations in the fillet significantly decreased when fish were fed diets with more IM and less FM. Arsenic speciation analysis of the diets showed that although total arsenic levels were similar, the arsenic species were different. Arsenobetaine was the major organoarsenic species in the diets containing FM, while in diets containing IM several unidentified arsenic species were detected. The results suggest that the lower feed-to-fillet transfer of arsenic when FM is replaced by IM may be due to the presence of arsenic species with low bioavailability in the IM."

Here we aimed to compare the effects of intake of Atlantic salmon fed fish oil (FO) with intake of Atlantic salmon fed a high proportion of vegetable oils (VOs) on development of insulin resistance and obesity in mice. Atlantic salmon were fed diets where FO was partly (80%) replaced with three different VOs; rapeseed oil (RO), olive oil (OO) or soy bean oil (SO). Fillets from Atlantic salmon were subsequently used to prepare Western diets (WD) for a mouse feeding trial. Partial replacement of FO with VOs reduced the levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and dichloro-diphenyl-tricloroethanes (DDT) with more than 50% in salmon fillets, in WDs containing the fillets, and in white adipose tissue from mice consuming the WDs. Replacement with VOs, SO in particular, lowered the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content and increased n-6 PUFA levels in the salmon fillets, in the prepared WDs, and in red blood cells collected from mice consuming the WDs. Replacing FO with VO did not influence obesity development in the mice, but replacement of FO with RO improved glucose tolerance. Compared with WD-FO fed mice, feeding mice WD-SO containing lower PCB and DDT levels but high levels of linoleic acid (LA), exaggerated insulin resistance and increased accumulation of fat in the liver. Replacement of FO with VOs in aqua feed for farmed salmon had markedly different spillover effects on metabolism in mice.

The Bayesian network relative risk model (BN-RRM) was used to conduct this ecological risk assessment and was modified to contain an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition pathway parameterized using data from CH toxicity data sets. The completed BN-RRM estimated risk at a population scale to Chinook salmon employing classical matrix modeling runs up to 50-y timeframes. There were 3 primary conclusions drawn from the model-building process and the risk calculations. First, the incorporation of an AChE inhibition pathway and the output from a population model can be combined with environmental factors in a quantitative fashion. Second, the probability of not meeting the management goal of no loss to the population ranges from 65% to 85%. Environmental conditions contributed to a larger proportion of the risk compared to CH. Third, the sensitivity analysis describing the influence of the variables on the predicted risk varied depending on seasonal conditions. In the summer, WT and DO were more influential than CH. In the winter, when the seasonal conditions are more benign, CH was the driver. Fourth, in order to reach the management goal, we calculated the conditions that would increase juvenile survival, adult survival, and a reduction in toxicological effects.

As a consequence of their use in a variety of products, they are quite common in rivers and other aquatic environments that receive sewage discharges. Because of its enhanced resistance towards biodegradation, toxicity, estrogenic effects, and ability to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms NP has been regarded as the most critical metabolite of APEs. We have studied the in vivo and in vitro metabolism and organ distribution of NP in juvenile salmon. Fish were exposed in vivo to waterborne [3H]-4-n-NP for a period up to 72 h or were administered a single oral dose of [3H]-4-n-NP. In vitro biotransformation of NP was studied by exposure of cultured salmon hepatocytes to [3H]-4-n-NP in the presence or absence of a CYP1A-inducer, beta-naphthoflavone (betaNF). Our results show that 4-n-NP was mainly metabolized in vivo, to its corresponding glucuronide conjugates and hydroxylates. The major route of excretion was the bile. The half-life of residues in carcass and muscle was between 24 and 48 h in both waterborne and dietary exposure. In whole body autoradiography, intragastric administered [3H]-4-n-NP was mainly present in the gastrointestinal tract and bile.

Although TBOEP and TCEP are consistently detected in the aquatic environment, there are few data about the possible toxicological effects of these compounds on aquatic organisms, including fish. In the present study, we have investigated the influence of TBOEP and TCEP on neuro- and interrenal steroidogenesis of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), after a seven-day exposure to four different concentrations (0 (control), 0.04, 0.2 and 1mg/L) of each compound. TBOEP and TCEP were diluted in Milli-Q water. The expression of genes involved in steroidogenesis (StAR, cyp19a, cyp19b, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-hsd), and 11β-hydroxylase (cyp11β)), were analyzed in the brain and head kidney using real-time PCR. Plasma 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) analysis was performed using enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Our results showed that TBOEP accumulated more rapidly than TCEP in fish muscle tissue. Surprisingly, TBOEP produced less pronounced effects than TCEP on neural and interrenal steroidogenic responses, despite the observed rapid uptake and bioaccumulation pattern. Specifically, TBOEP produced significant and consistent concentration-specific alterations on neural- and interrenal steroidogenesis. Plasma levels of 11-KT were not significantly altered by any of the exposures. The increased expression of steroidogenic genes demonstrated in the present study could produce time-specific alterations in the production of glucocorticoids and steroid hormones that play integral roles in fish metabolism, stress responses and adaptation, sexual maturation, reproduction and migration with overt consequences on reproductive success and survival."

Fish consumption advisories are issued by many government agencies to keep exposure to contaminants at a safe level. Such advisories are typically based on fillets and neglect consumption of other fish parts such as eggs by certain subpopulations. To evaluate potential for dietary exposure to toxic organic chemicals via fish eggs, we analyzed polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dlPCBs), and polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/furans (PCDD/Fs) in paired fillet and eggs of fish from a tributary to Lake Ontario, one of the North American Great Lakes. All wet weight based concentrations in fish eggs were statistically higher than in the paired fillet samples. In fish eggs, concentrations of Σ14PBDEs, Σ14PCNs, and Σ12dlPCBs were 41-118, 0.3-1.7, and 30-128 ng/g wet weight (ww), respectively; Σ3PCDD/Fs and total (dlPCB+ PCDD/Fs) toxic equivalents (TEQs) were 4-22 and 9-54 pg/g ww, respectively.

In contrast, the fillets had higher lipid normalized concentrations than the paired egg samples, suggesting that these chemicals did not reach equilibrium between the fillets and eggs. Accordingly, measured concentrations in eggs or empirical relationship with fillet rather than prediction from equilibrium partitioning model should be used to evaluate contaminant exposure via consumption of fish eggs.

In this study, we investigated the effect of curing method and freeze-thawing of cold-smoked salmon on (i) physicochemical properties and (ii) subsequent growth of genetically diverse strains of L. monocytogenes (inoculated after freeze-thawing) and endogenous lactic acid bacteria. The majority of the measured physicochemical properties were unaffected by freezing and thawing. Overall, wet-cured cold-smoked salmon had higher pH, water activity, and moisture, as well as lower fat, water-phase salt, and phenolic content compared with dry-cured cold-smoked salmon. The curing method and freeze-thawing did not affect growth of endogenous lactic acid bacteria. Freeze-thawing cold-smoked salmon prior to inoculation led to pronounced growth of L. monocytogenes at 7°C. The increase in cell density between days 0 and 30 was significantly (P = 0.0078) greater for cold-smoked salmon that was frozen and thawed prior to inoculation compared with nonfrozen cold-smoked salmon. On dry-cured, freeze-thawed cold-smoked salmon, L. monocytogenes had a lag phase ranging from 3.7 ± 0.1 to 11.2 ± 1.4 days compared with salmon that was wet cured and freeze-thawed, on which L. monocytogenes began to grow within 24 h. Variation in growth among L. monocytogenes strains was also observed, indicating the significance of assessing multiple strains. Further efforts to understand the impact of processing and postprocessing handling steps of cold-smoked salmon on the growth of genetically diverse L. monocytogenes will contribute to improved challenge study designs and data. This, in turn, will likely lead to more reliable and unbiased risk assessments and control measures."

The main cause of listeriosis is consumption of food contaminated from sources in food processing environments. Persistence in food processing facilities has previously been shown for the L. monocytogenes sequence type (ST) 8 subtype. In the current study, five ST8 strains were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and compared with five additionally available ST8 genomes, allowing comparison of strains from salmon, poultry and cheese industry, in addition to a human clinical isolate. Genome-wide analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) confirmed that almost identical strains were detected in a Danish salmon processing plant in 1996 and in a Norwegian salmon processing plant in 2001 and 2011. Furthermore, we show that L. monocytogenes ST8 was likely to have been transferred between two poultry processing plants as a result of relocation of processing equipment. The SNP data were used to infer the phylogeny of the ST8 strains, separating them into two main genetic groups. Within each group, the plasmid and prophage content was almost entirely conserved, but between groups, these sequences showed strong divergence. The accessory genome of the ST8 strains harbored genetic elements which could be involved in rendering the ST8 strains resilient to incoming mobile genetic elements. These included two restriction-modification loci, one of which was predicted to show phase variable recognition sequence specificity through site-specific domain shuffling. Analysis indicated that the ST8 strains harbor all important known L. monocytogenes virulence factors, and ST8 strains are commonly identified as the causative agents of invasive listeriosis. Therefore, the persistence of this L. monocytogenes subtype in food processing facilities poses a significant concern for food safety."

Smoked seafood is a ready-to-eat product with a high incidence of Lm contamination and has been associated with several recalls. We used cold-smoked salmon as a model product to develop a decision support tool (the regulatory and recall risk [3R] model) to estimate (i) baseline regulatory and recall (RR) risks (i. e. , overall risks of a lot sampled and found positive for Lm, e. g. , by food regulatory agencies) due to Lm contamination and (ii) the RR risk reduction that can be achieved through interventions with underlying mechanisms such as reducing the prevalence and/or level of Lm and retarding or preventing Lm growth. Given that a set number of samples (e. g. , 10) are tested for a given lot, the RR risk equals the likelihood of detecting Lm in at least one sample. Under the baseline scenario, which assumes a 4% Lm prevalence and no interventions, the median predicted RR risk for a given production lot was 0.333 (95% credible interval: 0.288, 0.384) when 10 25-g samples were tested. Nisin treatments, which reduce both the prevalence and initial level of Lm, reduced RR risks in a concentration-dependent manner to 0.109 (0.074, 0.146) with 5 ppm, 0.049 (0.024, 0.083) with 10 ppm, and 0.017 (0.007, 0.033) with 20 ppm. In general, more effective reduction in RR risks can be achieved by reducing Lm prevalence than by retarding Lm growth; the RR risk was reduced to 0.182 (0.153, 0.213) by a 50% prevalence reduction but to only 0.313 (0.268, 0.367) by bacteriostatic growth inhibitors. Sensitivity analysis indicated that prevalence and initial level of Lm and storage temperature have the greatest impact on predicting RR risks, suggesting that reliable data for these parameters will improve model performance."

With the aim of facilitating surveillance of relevant mycotoxins and isoflavones, we have developed and validated a multi-analyte LC-HRMS/MS method that can be used to ensure compliance to set maximum levels in feed and fish. The method performance characteristics were determined, showing high specificity for all 25 targeted analytes, which included 19 mycotoxins and three isoflavones and their corresponding aglycons with sufficient to excellent sensitivities and uniform analytical linearity in different matrices. Depending on the availability of matching stable isotope-labelled derivates or similar-structure homologues, calibration curves were generated either by using internal standards or by matrix-matched external standards. Precision and recovery data were in the accepted range, although they varied between the different analytes. This new method was considered as fit-for-purpose and applied for the analysis of customised fish feed containing wheat gluten, soy, or pea protein concentrate as well as salmon and zebrafish fed on diets with these ingredients for a period of up to eight weeks.

A logistic regression was used to model the probability of growth of L. monocytogenes as a function of concentrations of salt and phenol, and storage temperature. Resulted models showed that the probabilities of growth of L. monocytogenes in both salmon and TSB decreased when the salt and/or phenol concentrations increased, and at lower storage temperatures. In general, the growth probabilities of L. monocytogenes were affected more profoundly by salt and storage temperature than by phenol. The growth probabilities of L. monocytogenes estimated by the TSB model were higher than those by the salmon model at the same salt/phenol concentrations and storage temperatures. The growth probabilities predicted by the salmon and TSB models were comparable at higher storage temperatures, indicating the potential use of TSB as a model system to substitute salmon in studying the growth behavior of L. monocytogenes may only be suitable when the temperatures of interest are in higher storage temperatures (e. g. , >12 degrees C).

However, these interventions also indiscriminately kill beneficial bacteria in foods, may impact organoleptic properties of foods, and are not always environmentally friendly. Biocontrol using bacteriophage-based products to reduce or eliminate specific foodborne pathogens in food products has been gaining attention due to the specificity, safety, and environmentally friendly properties of lytic bacteriophages. We developed EcoShield PX, a cocktail of lytic bacteriophages, that specifically targets STEC.

The fish survival was 100%, 80% and 0%, respectively ≤1.6, 3.2 and 6.4 mg/L. Fish swimming behaviour was normal in PAA ≤ 1.6 mg/L, whereas it become erratic with air gasping for PAA ≥ 3.2 mg/L. The fish appetite did not change among the different PAA treatment groups. Skin and gill histopathological alterations were pronounced in PAA ≥ 3.2 mg/L, characterized by a poorer skin condition and necrotic gill lamella. The skin acidic mucous cells density was 55% lower in the 6.4 mg/L group than the 0 mg/L group. The sub-lethal water pH values observed in the 6.4 mg/L group after PAA administration may have played a confounding and compounding factor to the PAA toxicity response in this group. In conclusion, the current study identified the no-observed-effect concentration for PAA to be below 1.6 mg/L for Atlantic salmon parr and provided insights into its use as a water prophylactic strategy in RAS. Toxicity of PAA-based disinfectants is influenced by its acidified nature, which can interfere with the water pH of low alkalinity aquaculture systems. Further studies should evaluate the health and welfare consequences of a long-term PAA exposure in Atlantic salmon parr."

The aim of this study was to develop a sensitive and false-positive free propidium monoazide-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PMA-qPCR) assay to quantify the viable but non-culturable (VBNC) E. coli present in secondary wastewater effluent after chlorine disinfection. The qPCR target was the E. coli uidA gene, and native Taq was used to eliminate false positives caused by the presence of contaminant E. coli DNA in recombinant Taq polymerase reagents. Due to issues with qPCR inhibitors in wastewater, this study explored several pre-DNA extraction treatment methods for qPCR inhibitor removal. PMA-qPCR validation was done using salmon testes DNA (Sketa DNA) as an exogenous control added directly to the wastewater samples and amplified using a separate qPCR assay. After disinfection of secondary effluent with 2ppm chlorine at the plant, the mean Log10 CFU reduction in E. coli was 2.85 from a mean CFU of 3.48/10mL compared to 0.21 Log10 CCE mean reduction of the uidA gene from a mean CCE of 3.16/10mL. The VBNC cell concentrations were calculated as 2.32 Log10/10mL by subtracting the colony forming units (CFU) obtained from membrane filtration from the calculated CFU equivalent (CCE) values obtained from PMA-qPCR. These results demonstrate the effective use of a PMA-qPCR method for the quantification of the E. coli uidA gene and indicate there are high numbers (2.01×103CCE/100mL) of VBNC E. coli cells leaving the wastewater treatment plant in the final effluent after chlorine treatment. VBNC bacterial cells are of concern as they have the potential to resuscitate and grow, regain virulence, affect natural microbiome in the discharge sites, and pass on antimicrobial resistant genes to other microorganisms."

Although most reported cases appear to be sporadic and the maximum bacterial concentration of 100 cfu/g is not usually exceeded at retail, cold smoked and salt-cured fish products have been noted as those products with great risk especially for the elderly. In order to investigate the listeriosis risk more carefully, an exposure assessment was developed, and laboratory results for cold smoked and salt-cured salmon products were exploited. L. monocytogenes exposure was modeled for consumers in two age groups, the elderly population as a risk group and the working-age population as a reference. Incidence was assessed by estimating bacterial growth in the food products at three temperatures. Bayesian estimation of the risk was based on bacterial occurrence and product consumption data and epidemiological population data. The model builds on a two-state Markov chain describing repeated consumption on consecutive days. The cumulative exposure is probabilistically governed by the daily decreasing likelihood of continued consumption and the increasing bacterial concentrations due to growth. The population risk was then predicted with a Poisson distribution accounting for the daily probabilities of purchasing a contaminated product and the cumulative total probability of infection from its use. According to the model presented in this article, elderly Finns are at a greater risk of acquiring listeriosis than healthy adults. The risk for the elderly does not fully diminish even if the products have been stored at the recommended temperature (between 0 and 3 °C). It can be concluded that the stage after retail, i. e. food handling and storage by consumer or professional kitchens, is essential to protection against listeriosis. The estimation model provides means for assessing the joint impacts of these effects."

Ten muscle samples were taken from each of two Puget Sound hatcheries and two coastal hatcheries in Washington State to determine PCB concentrations. Two technical mixtures of PCBs, Aroclor 1254 and Aroclor 1260, were measured in the tissue samples collected. Aroclor 1254 was detected in all samples, while Aroclor 1260 was detected in 16 of 40 samples. Generalized linear modeling (GLM) was used to evaluate the influence of region (Puget Sound and coast), hatchery, sex, fish length, and percent lipids on PCB concentrations. Twenty different GLMs representing multiple null hypotheses were ranked using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Six of the 20 models evaluated had substantial support for being the best model to describe PCB concentrations in Chinook salmon. The six models with substantial support were region and lipids; region; hatchery and lipid; region and sex; region, sex, and lipids; and region and length. Region appears to be the most influential variable explaining the variation in PCB concentrations in Chinook salmon in the Pacific Northwest. PCB concentrations in Chinook salmon muscle tissue from Puget Sound hatcheries were significantly greater (mean 49.26 microg/kg wet weight and standard deviation 40.55 microg/kg) than those from coastal hatcheries (mean 17.41 microg/kg wet weight and standard deviation 6.8 microg/kg).

Associations between toenail arsenic and consumption of 120 individual diet items were quantified using general linear models that also accounted for household tap water arsenic and potentially confounding factors (e. g. , age, caloric intake, sex, smoking) (n = 852). As part of the analysis, we assessed whether associations between log-transformed toenail arsenic and each diet item differed between subjects with household drinking water arsenic concentrations <1 μg/L versus ≥1 μg/L. As expected, toenail arsenic concentrations increased with household water arsenic concentrations. Among the foods known to be high in arsenic, no clear relationship between toenail arsenic and rice consumption was detected, but there was a positive association with consumption of dark meat fish, a category that includes tuna steaks, mackerel, salmon, sardines, bluefish, and swordfish.

To test the ecological effects of historic mining in the headwaters of the upper Salmon River watershed in Idaho (USA), we measured multiple community and chemical endpoints in downstream linked aquatic-terrestrial food webs. Mining inputs impacted downstream food webs through increased mercury accumulation and decreased insect biodiversity. Total mercury (THg) in seston, aquatic insect larvae, adult aquatic insects, riparian spiders, and fish at sites up to 7.6 km downstream of mining was found at much higher concentrations (1.3-11.3-fold) and was isotopically distinct compared with sites immediately upstream of mining inputs. Methylmercury concentrations in bull trout and riparian spiders were sufficiently high (732-918 and 347-1140 ng MeHg g-1 dry wt, respectively) to affect humans, birds, and piscivorous fish. Furthermore, the alpha-diversity of benthic insects was locally depressed by 12%-20% within 4.3-5.7 km downstream from the mine. However, because total insect biomass was not affected by mine inputs, the mass of mercury in benthic insects at a site (i. e. , ng Hg m-2 ) was extremely elevated downstream (10-1778-fold) compared with directly upstream of mining inputs.

Low concentrations were found in water samples whereas the organic waste from the farm, collected by sediment traps had concentrations higher than the medicated feed. Most of the organic waste was distributed to the bottom close to the farm but organic particles containing teflubenzuron were collected 1100 m from the farm. The sediment under the farm consisted of 5 to 10% organic material and therefore the concentration of teflubenzuron was much lower than in the organic waste.

The kinetics of parent EQ and its major metabolite, ethoxyquin dimer (EQDM) was also studied. In general two weeks seem to be the critical point in the entire toxicological response of salmon to dietary consumed EQ. Biotransformation of EQ to EQDM is shown to be a rapid process. However, the decrease in biotransformation rate results in the accumulation of EQ metabolites, high concentration of which was postulated to alter translation and post-translational modification of CYP3A, GST and UDPGT at feeding day 14 and 42, with subsequent decreases in the biotransformation of consumed EQ. Decrease in the biotransformation of consumed EQ produced the retention of un-metabolized EQ rather than metabolites in salmon liver. This may be considered as undesirable effect, since it could lead to the transport and accumulation in other organs and edible tissues. It may also cause a new wave of biotransformation with formation of metabolites inhibiting detoxifying enzymes. In general, these processes may prolong the excretion of dietary EQ from the fish body and produce EQ-derived residues in the ready-to-consume salmon or fish products. These EQ residues may have higher toxicological effects for human consumers than the parent compound and therefore need to be studied in more detail."

Although the concentrations in the environment and biota have continuously decreased, dioxins still pose a risk to human health. The risk and its formation vary in different parts of the Baltic Sea, due to variability in the environmental and societal factors affecting it. This paper presents a systematic literature review and knowledge synthesis about the regional dioxin risk formation in four sub-areas of the Baltic Sea and evaluates, whether systemic approach changes our thinking about the risk and its effective management. We studied the dioxin flux from atmospheric deposition to the Baltic Sea food webs, accumulation to two commercially and culturally important fish species, Baltic herring (Clupea harengus membras) and Baltic salmon (Salmo salar), and further to risk group members of four Baltic countries. Based on 46 studies, we identified 20 quantifiable variables and indexed them for commensurable regional comparison. Spatial differences in dioxin pollution, environmental conditions, food web dynamics, and the following dioxin concentrations in herring and salmon, together with fishing and fish consumption, affect how the final health risk builds up. In the southern Baltic Sea, atmospheric pollution levels are relatively high and environmental processes to decrease bioavailability of dioxins unfavorable, but the growth is fast, which curb the bioaccumulation of dioxins in the biota. In the North, long-range atmospheric pollution is minor compared to South, but the local pollution and slower growth leads to higher bioaccumulation rates. However, based on our results, the most remarkable differences in the dioxin risk formation between the areas arise from the social sphere: the emissions, origin of national catches, and cultural differences in fish consumption.

Further, the bactericidal mechanisms of FeSO4 were explored. With a fluorescent probe of Fe2+, a significant influx of Fe2+ was determined in V. parahaemolyticus exposed to FeSO4, and the addition of an intracellular Fe2+ chelator was able to block the cell death. This suggested that cell death in V. parahaemolyticus induced by FeSO4 was dependent on the influx of Fe2+. It was intriguing that we did not observe the eruption of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid hydroperoxides by Fe2+, but the application of liproxstatin-1 (a ferroptosis inhibitor) significantly modified the occurrence of cell death in V. parahaemolyticus. These results suggested FeSO4-induced cell death in V. parahaemolyticus be a ferroptosis differing from that in mammalian cells.

Salmon and arctic char, were sampled in the early 1970s as well as the late 1990s. Fish eating grey seal (Halichoerus gryphus) and guillemot (Uria aalge) from the Baltic Sea were included to screen for whether BCPS biomagnify or not. The representativeness of the analysed samples for studying bioaccumulation of environmental pollutants was compared through analysis of two well known persistent and bioaccumulating compounds, 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB-153), and 4,4'-DDE. Pooled muscle and blubber samples based on 4-10 individuals were used for analysis, as well as individual samples of grey seal blubber. 2,4,4'-Trichlorodiphenyl sulfone, was synthesised and applied as an internal standard. BCPS was detected in all marine samples but in only one of the fresh water fish samples. The highest BCPS concentrations detected, 1600 and 1900 ng/g lipid weighet (l. w. ), were found in muscle from Baltic guillemot. The results indicate that BCPS is bioaccumulated in both grey seal and guillemot, and that the guillemot has higher concentrations of BCPS than the grey seal (50-500 ng/g l. w. ). The concentrations found in different species of fish from the Baltic Sea ranged between 15-37 ng/g l. w. and lower concentrations were found in freshwater species (n. d. -1.8 ng/g l. w. ). The present study shows that BCPS is found in all investigated species of wildlife but, in most species, still at low concentrations. However, the guillemot has levels in the low ppm range indicating a considerable biomagnification of BCPS in this species."

A total of 470 fillets of 18 fish species collected from various parts of the Canadian waters of the Great Lakes between 2006 and 2013 were analyzed for 17 (expanded to 33 in 2009) PBDEs. For a limited number of species, fillet to whole body and fillet to eggs PBDEs were compared to examine pattern and concentration among tissue types. Levels and patterns of PBDEs varied dramatically within and among the 18 fish species. Bottom dwelling Common Carp (and White Sucker) exhibited the highest ∑PBDE levels (27-71ng/g). Lake Trout and Lake Whitefish from Lake Superior had higher levels than those from the other Great Lakes; otherwise the spatial trend was Lake Ontario≫Erie~Huron~Superior. The measured levels would result in restriction on consumption of only Common Carp from the Toronto waterfront area, which is in proximity to the most urbanised region on the Canadian side of the basin. Deca-BDE was the major congener in panfish, while BDE-47 was the major congener in top predators and its contribution to ∑PBDE increased with the contamination. Although ∑PBDE was related to fish length and lipid content when all measurements were pooled, the relationships were variable for individual sampling events (species/location/year). Whole body ∑PBDE for bottom dweller Brown Bullhead and Common Carp were 2.6-4.9 times greater and egg ∑PBDE for four fatty Salmon/Trout species were same to 6.5 times greater than the corresponding fillet concentrations. Levels of major lower brominated PBDEs appear to have declined in fish fillets by 46-74% between 2006/07 and 2012. Although PBDE in existing consumer items will remain in-use for a while, it will likely not result in appreciable accumulation of PBDEs in fish. Based on an overall assessment, regular monitoring of PBDEs in Great Lake fish can be replaced with targeted surveillance and focus can be shifted to other in-use flame retardants."

As a preliminary approach to understand the combined effects of radionuclides, exposure studies were designed using gamma radiation (Gamma) and depleted uranium (DU) as stressors, representing a combination of radiological (radiation) and chemical (metal) exposure. Juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were exposed to 70mGy external Gamma dose delivered over the first 5h of a 48h period (14mGy/h), 0.25mg/L DU were exposed continuously for 48h and the combination of the two stressors (Combi). Water and tissue concentrations of U were determined to assess the exposure quality and DU bioaccumulation. Hepatic gene expression changes were determined using microarrays in combination with quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Effects at the higher physiological levels were determined as plasma glucose (general stress) and hepatic histological changes. The results show that bioaccumulation of DU was observed after both single DU and the combined exposure. Global transcriptional analysis showed that 3122, 2303 and 3460 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly regulated by exposure to gamma, DU and Combi, respectively. Among these, 349 genes were commonly regulated by all treatments, while the majority was found to be treatment-specific. Functional analysis of DEGs revealed that the stressors displayed similar mode of action (MoA) across treatments such as induction of oxidative stress, DNA damage and disturbance of oxidative phosphorylation, but also stressor-specific mechanisms such as cellular stress and injury, metabolic disorder, programmed cell death, immune response. No changes in plasma glucose level as an indicator of general stress and hepatic histological changes were observed.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of salt, a smoke compound, storage temperature, and their interactions on L. monocytogenes in simulated smoked salmon. A six-strain mixture of L. monocytogenes (10(2) to 10(3) CFU/g) was inoculated into minced, cooked salmon containing 0 to 10% NaCl and 0 to 0.4% liquid smoke (0 to 34 ppm of phenol), and the samples were stored at temperatures from 0 to 25 degrees C. Lag-phase duration (LPD; hour), growth rate (GR; log CFU per hour), and maximum population density (MPD; log CFU per gram) of L. monocytogenes in salmon, as affected by the concentrations of salt and phenol, storage temperature, and their interactions, were analyzed. Results showed that L. monocytogenes was able to grow in salmon containing the concentrations of salt and phenol commonly found in smoked salmon at the prevailing storage temperatures. The growth of L. monocytogenes was affected significantly (P < 0.05) by salt, phenol, storage temperature, and their interactions. As expected, higher concentrations of salt or lower storage temperatures extended the LPD and reduced the GR. Higher concentrations of phenol extended the LPD of L. monocytogenes, particularly at lower storage temperatures. However, its effect on reducing the GR of L. monocytogenes was observed only at higher salt concentrations (>6%) at refrigerated and mild abuse temperatures (< 10 degrees C). The MPD, which generally reached 7 to 8 log CFU/g in salmon that supported L. monocytogenes growth, was not affected by the salt, phenol, and storage temperature. Two models were developed to describe the LPD and GR of L. monocytogenes in salmon containing 0 to 8% salt, 0 to 34 ppm of phenol, and storage temperatures of 4 to 25 degrees C. The data and models obtained from this study would be useful for estimating the behavior of L. monocytogenes in smoked salmon."

DDT was the predominant pesticide. The contamination pattern of persistent organic pollutants was as follows: dieldrin > cis-chlordane > hexachlorobenzene, with average concentrations ranging from 0.09 to 2.74 ng/g. The risk was assessed in terms of the estimated daily intake (EDI) for potential adverse indices; the EDI of OCP residues was lower than 1% of the acceptable daily intake established by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and World Health Organization.

L. monocytogenes was not detected in a freshwater stream, but prevalence increased with the degree of human activity: 2% in seawater fish farms, 10% in freshwater fish farms, 16% in fish slaughterhouses, and 68% in a fish smokehouse. The fish farms and slaughterhouses processed Danish rainbow trout, whereas the smokehouse was used for farm-raised Norwegian salmon. No variation with season was observed. Inside the processing plants, the pattern of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) types was homogeneous, but greater diversity existed among isolates from the outside environments. The RAPD type dominating the inside of the fish smokehouse was found only sporadically in outside environments. To examine survival in different environments, L. monocytogenes or Listeria innocua strains were inoculated into freshwater and saltwater microcosms. Pathogen counts decreased over time in Instant Ocean and remained constant in phosphate-buffered saline. In contrast, counts decreased rapidly in natural seawater and fresh water. The count reduction was much slower when the natural waters were autoclaved or filtered (0.2-microm pore size), indicating that the pathogen reduction in natural waters was attributable to a biological mechanism, e. g. , protozoan grazing. A low prevalence of L. monocytogenes was found in the outside environment, and the bacteria did not survive well in natural environments. Therefore, L. monocytogenes in the outer environment associated with Danish fish processing is probably of minor importance to the environment inside a fish production plant."

The POPs were removed using short-path distillation, aided by a working fluid, and were highly efficiently removed resulting in low dietary levels. Each diet was fed to fish in four cages, 5×5×5m, and the fish were fed ad libitum by aiming at least 10% over feeding every day. Although the growth rate was low during the first months of the trial, the growth rate was good in total, from sea transfer to harvest size. The fish fed the diet with the cleansed oil grew significantly better than the control fish in 1 of the 5 periods. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was significantly lower for the cleansed oil group for 2 of the 5 periods, as well as the total trial period. Nutrient digestibility was measured when the fish were around 1kg and at termination of the study, and there were no significant differences between the dietary groups. There were no significant differences in dress out loss and condition factor, and hepatosomatic index was found to be significantly higher for the control group at the last sampling. Colour was measured by using DSM Salmofan at four points on the fillet as well as in the Norwegian Quality Cut, and found to be significantly higher for the control fish in one intermediate sampling. At the last sampling, there was however a tendency of higher colorization for the cleansed oil group. For fillets sampled at the termination for quality assessments, there were only minor differences in muscle pH, firmness, colour and consumer test. The muscle pH was significantly higher and muscle firmness tended to be higher for the cleansed oil group. The levels of POPs in fillets were highly significantly lower in fish fed diets with the cleansed oil. In conclusion, none of the parameters measured in the present study indicate any negative effects of the cleansing process in Atlantic salmon from smolt stage to harvest size. On the contrary, the study suggests positive effects on growth, feed utilisation efficiency and product quality."

This method was single-lab-validated, and method detection limits were reported at 345 ng kg-1 for perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and 207 ng kg-1 for perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) and below 100 ng kg-1 for the rest of the PFAS analytes.

Most of the seafood packaging was also analyzed by Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) to identify packaging potentially coated with PFASs. None of the packaging samples in this study were identified as having PFASs. A wide range of concentrations was observed among the seafood samples, ranging from below the method detection limit to the highest concentration of 23 μg kg-1 for the sum of PFASs in one of the canned clam samples. Such a wide range is consistent with those reported in previous studies. The highest concentrations were reported in clams and crabs, followed by cod, tuna, pollock, tilapia, salmon, and shrimp. Technical perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) dominated the profile of the clam samples, which has been consistently found in other clam samples, especially in Asia. Long-chain PFCAs, specifically perfluoroundecanoic (PFUdA) and perfluorododecanoic (PFDoA), were the most frequently detected analytes across all seafood samples. The trends observed are comparable with those in the literature where benthic organisms tend to have the highest PFAS concentrations, followed by lean fish, fatty fish, and aquaculture.

To spread risks among Puget Sound chinook salmon populations, recovery strategies for ESU-wide viability recommend at least two viable populations of historical life-history types in each of five geographic regions. We explored the likelihood of Puget Sound chinook salmon ESU persistence by examining spatial patterns of catastrophic risk and testing ESU viability recommendations for 22 populations of the threatened Puget Sound chinook salmon ESU. We combined geospatial information about catastrophic risks and chinook salmon distribution in Puget Sound watersheds to categorize relative catastrophic risks for each population. We then analyzed similarities in risk scores among regions and compared risk distributions among strategies: (1) population groups selected using the ESU viability recommendations of having populations spread out geographically and including historical life-history diversity, and (2) population groups selected at random. Risks from individual catastrophes varied among populations, but overall risk from catastrophes was similar within geographic regions. Recovery strategies that called for two viable populations in each of five geographic regions had lower risk than random strategies; strategies that included life-history diversity had even lower risks. Geographically distributed populations have varying catastrophic-risks profiles, thus identifying and reinforcing the spatial and life-history diversity critical for populations to respond to environmental change or needed to rescue severely depleted or extirpated populations.

Contaminating Listeria monocytogenes in fresh salmon represents a health hazard to consumers, is linked to extensive product recalls and is a major challenge for salmon processors. Verdad N6, a commercially available buffered vinegar, was evaluated as a treatment for raw salmon fillets either alone or in combination with the antimicrobial peptide nisin, with regard to anti-listerial effects under processing and storage, and influence on sensory quality and background microbiota. Salmon fillets were surface contaminated with L. monocytogenes and immersed in solutions of Verdad N6 or treated with nisin or a combination of these two treatments. Levels of L. monocytogenes were determined during vacuum-pack refrigerated storage. The use of Verdad N6 resulted in increased lag times and substantially reduced growth of L. monocytogenes. The inhibitory effects were dependent on Verdad N6 levels, immersion time, and storage time and temperature. A 5 s immersion in 10% Verdad N6 solution at 4 °C reduced growth of L. monocytogenes from log 2.8 to log 1 after 12 days of storage. Nisin (0.2-1 ppm) had listericidal effects up to 1 log but did not inhibit regrowth when used alone. Appropriate combinations of Verdad N6 and nisin led to L. monocytogenes levels no higher after 12 days of storage than the initial levels. The inhibitory effects were markedly lower at 7 °C than at 4 °C. Salmon with Verdad N6 showed reduced levels of total counts during storage indicating a longer shelf-life, and a shift in the dominating bacteria with reduced and increased relative levels of Enterobacteriaceae and lactic acid bacteria, respectively. Sensory analyses of raw and cooked Verdad N6 treated a non-treated salmon resulted in small differences. In summary, Verdad N6 is an option for production of high-quality raw salmon with increased shelf-life and enhanced food safety through its Listeria inhibiting effects. The application of Verdad N6 in combination with nisin treatment can further reduce the listeria-risks of these products."

Furthermore, most studies utilize aqueous exposures, whereas the dietary route of exposure may be more important for fish owing to the hydrophobicity of many pesticides. Consequently, the current study aimed to determine the effects of elevated temperatures and dietary pesticide mixtures on swimming performance and lipid metabolism of juvenile Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. Fish were fed pesticide-dosed pellets at three concentrations and three temperatures (11, 14 and 17 °C) for 14 days and swimming performance (Umax) and expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and energetics were assessed (ATP citrate lyase, fatty acid synthase, farnesoid x receptor and liver x receptor). The low-pesticide pellet treatment contained five pesticides, p,p'-DDE, bifenthrin, esfenvalerate, chlorpyrifos and fipronil at concentrations based on prey items collected from the Sacramento River (CA, USA) watershed, with the high-pesticide pellet treatment containing a six times higher dose. Temperature exacerbated effects of pesticide exposure on swimming performance, with significant reductions in Umax of 31 and 23% in the low and high-pesticide pellet groups relative to controls at 17 °C, but no significant differences in Umax among pesticide concentrations at 11 or 14 °C. At 14 °C there was a significant positive relationship between juvenile Chinook salmon pesticide body residues and expression of ATP citrate lyase and fatty acid synthase, but an inverse relationship and significant downregulation at 17 °C.

In Chile, industrial aquaculture of salmon has expanded rapidly in the last 20 years becoming a major export business. The exponential growth of this industry has been accompanied by an unrestricted heavy usage of antibiotics in the aquatic environments of lakes, rivers and the ocean, and its impact is being felt in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria around aquaculture sites and a decrease in the plancktonic diversity in the same areas. The passage of antibiotic resistance genes from aquatic bacteria to human and animal pathogens has been demonstrated, indicating that industrial use of antibiotics in aquaculture affects negatively the antibiotic therapy of human and animal bacterial infections. The Chilean situation triggers important concerns because it includes the use of fluoroquinolones in aquaculture, that are not biodegradable and are able to remain in the environment for years as well as being still effective in treating human infections. The use of large volumes of a wide spectrum of antibiotics in an aquatic environment heavily contaminated with human and animal pathogens also amplifies the opportunities for gene transfer among bacteria, facilitating the emergence of antibiotic resistance and more pathogenic bacterial recombinants. The detection of residual antibiotics in salmons marketed for human consumption that can modify the normal flora of the population also suggests the need for controls on this antibiotic usage and on the presence of residual antibiotics in aquaculture food products. This important problem of public health demands an active dialogue between government officials responsible for protecting public health, aquaculture industry representatives, politicians, consumers and professionals dealing with these matters."

Therefore, we have studied the liver deposition and toxicological effects in salmon fed graded levels of BHT during a 12-week feeding followed by a 2-week depuration period using chemical, molecular, and catalytic assays. In general, our data showed that BHT was significantly retained in the liver and selectively modulated toxicological responses in the xenobiotic biotransformation pathways during the feeding period. Specifically, BHT produced consistent dose- and time-specific gene expression patterns for AhR2alpha, AhR2beta, CYP1A1, CYP3A, UGT1, and GSTpi. The effect of BHT on the gene expression of biotransformation enzyme did not parallel enzyme activity levels, suggesting a possible inhibition by parent BHT or its metabolites. As a safety precaution, the production of farmed Atlantic salmon in Norway requires a mandatory 2-week depuration period prior to slaughtering and market delivery to ensure the elimination of veterinary medicaments, additives, and other undesirable components. Comparison of feeding and depuration periods showed that BHT was highly retained in fish liver, as only 8-13% of fed BHT was eliminated during the 2-week depuration period. This is just a part of the total concentration in the whole fish, since BHT may have been distributed and accumulated in other organs.

Although the toxicological impacts of CECs on salmon are poorly understood, several of the detected contaminants disrupt mitochondrial function in other species. Here, we sought to determine whether environmental exposures to CECs are associated with hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction in juvenile Chinook. Fish were exposed in the laboratory to a dietary mixture of 16 analytes representative of the predominant CECs detected in our field study. Liver mitochondrial content was reduced in fish exposed to CECs, which occurred concomitantly with a 24-32% reduction in expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) Y coactivator-1a (pgc-1α), a positive transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. The laboratory exposures also caused a 40-70% elevation of state 4 respiration per unit mitochondria, which drove a 29-38% reduction of efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation relative to controls. The mixture-induced elevation of respiration was associated with increased oxidative injury as evidenced by increased mitochondrial protein carbonyls, elevated expression of glutathione (GSH) peroxidase 4 (gpx4), a mitochondrial-associated GSH peroxidase that protects against lipid peroxidation, and reduction of mitochondrial GSH. Juvenile Chinook sampled in a WWTP effluent-impacted estuary with demonstrated releases of CECs showed similar trends toward reduced liver mitochondrial content and elevated respiratory activity per mitochondria (including state 3 and uncoupled respiration). However, respiratory control ratios were greater in fish from the contaminated site relative to fish from a minimally-polluted reference site, which may have been due to differences in the timing of exposure to CECs under laboratory and field conditions. Our results indicate that exposure to CECs can affect both mitochondrial quality and content, and support the analysis of mitochondrial function as an indicator of the sublethal effects of CECs in wild fish."

However the benefits are a more secure and less volatile raw material supply, together with environmental feed contaminants at low or undetectable levels in the resulting salmon product. There is widespread adoption of standards and certification schemes by Scottish salmon farmers and feed suppliers in order to demonstrate environmental sustainability. This has focused in particular on use of certified ingredients from sustainable supply sources (‘responsible sourcing’). Future volume estimates of Scottish salmon production, hence feed requirements, are insufficient to threaten raw material supply compared with global markets, although it is argued this is likely to involve greater use of locally grown plant proteins and an increased proportion of fishmeal manufactured from by-product trimmings (derived from processing fish for human consumption). However, UK retail chains will remain reluctant to allow salmon suppliers to utilise land animal by-products due to negative consumer perceptions, with resulting implications for formulation cost and flexibility. Given its world-wide scarcity, the main strategic concern relates to future availability of sufficient omega-3 LC-PUFA, in particular eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in order to maintain the healthy image of Scottish salmon. To maintain its longer-term reputation and product benefits, the Scottish industry may need to consider adopting a more flexible attitude to using new alternatives to fish oil (e. g. EPA and DHA derived from transgenic oil seed crops, when commercially available). It is concluded that Scottish salmon farming is a successful example of sustainable feed development and the industry can be confident that the changing raw material base will support continuing production of high quality, healthy farmed salmon, but the long-term security of supply of omega-3 LC-PUFA remains an issue."

To address this uncertainty, we sampled four stream‐resident fish species from 13 watersheds of the Laurentian Great Lakes in locations with and without salmon runs across a gradient of instream and watershed characteristics. We determined the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and mercury (Hg) concentration along with the stable isotope ratios for salmon and stream‐resident fish. We found that stream‐resident fish PCB concentrations were higher in reaches with salmon and were positively related to δ¹⁵N. In contrast, resident fish Hg concentrations were similar or lower in reaches with salmon compared with reaches lacking salmon and either exhibited a negative or no relationship with δ¹⁵N. Based on AICc, resident fish exhibited species‐specific PCB concentrations that were positively related to salmon PCB flux. Hg burdens exhibited an interaction between fish length and salmon Hg flux—as salmon Hg inputs increased, Hg levels decreased with increasing resident fish length. Because salmon eggs are enriched in PCBs but depleted in Hg, contaminant loads of resident fish appear to be driven by consumption of salmon eggs. We found no support for models that included the mediating influence of instream or watershed factors. Synthesis and applications.

The model conditions consisted of a direct application of the EAS to the spores, which avoided any interference with factors external to those of the solutions.

The Sacramento River and its tributaries have historically supported the majority of California's Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) spawning grounds. Three pesticides currently used in the Sacramento Valley-- dinoseb, diazinon, and esfenvalerate-- were chosen to model the exposure of salmon embryos to storm-water discharges. Static-renewal (96 h) exposures to eyed eggs and alevins resulted in both toxicity and significant changes in metabolism assessed in whole-embryo extracts by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy based metabolomics and HPLC with UV detection (HPLC-UV). The 96-h LC(50) values of eyed eggs and alevins exposed to dinoseb were 335 and 70.6 ppb, respectively, and the corresponding values for diazinon were 545 and 29.5 ppm for eyed eggs and alevins, respectively. The 96-h LC(50) of eyed eggs exposed to esfenvalerate could not be determined due to lack of mortality at the highest exposure concentration, but in alevins was 16.7 ppb. All esfenvalerate exposed alevins developed some degree of lordosis or myoskeletal abnormality and did not respond to stimulus or exhibit normal swimming behavior. ATP concentrations measured by HPLC-UV decreased significantly in eyed eggs due to 250 ppb dinoseb and 10 and 100 ppb esfenvalerate (p < 0.05). Phosphocreatine, as measured by HPLC-UV, decreased significantly in eyed eggs due to 250 ppb dinoseb, 10 and 100 ppb esfenvalerate, and 100 ppm diazinon (p < 0.05). Principal components analyses of (1)H NMR metabolite fingerprints of eyed egg and alevin extracts revealed both dose-dependent and mechanism of action-specific metabolic effects induced by the pesticides. Furthermore, NMR based metabolomics proved to be more sensitive than HPLC-UV in identifying significant changes in sublethal metabolism of pesticide exposed alevins. In conclusion, we have demonstrated several benefits of a metabolomics approach for chemical risk assessment, when used in conjunction with a fish embryo assay, and have identified significant metabolic perturbations to the early life stages of Chinook salmon by currently used pesticides."

This study was conducted to present a direct comparison of radiocesium (134Cs and 137Cs) concentrations in marine and freshwater fish inhabiting different water bodies in Fukushima Prefecture (coastal waters, 6.3-54.5 km from the plant; forest rivers and irrigation ponds, 1.4-71.6 km), and to reveal plausible contamination mechanisms for each habitat. In contrast to marine demersal fish (7 species, n = 50), which showed lower and less variable radiocesium concentrations (0.234-3.41 Bq kg-1-wet), freshwater fish (6 species, n = 463) showed higher and more site-specific variations for each species and habitat (4.09 Bq kg-1-wet - 25.6 kBq kg-1-wet) in 2015-2016. The apparent concentration ratio (aCR, L/kg) of 137Cs in fish to water is higher for fish of freshwater habitats (mean 1240-12900 for each site) than in those of coastal waters (mean 200). Radiocesium contamination is more severe and persistent in freshwater fish, especially those distributed within the designated evacuation zone (salmon in rivers and bass in ponds). Continuous radiocesium uptake through the food web in relation to fish feeding habits and size (size effect), and biotic/abiotic characteristics in water and surrounding environments are main factors affecting site/habitat-specific bioaccumulation of radiocesium in freshwater fish. By contrast, uniformly lower radiocesium concentrations in marine demersal fish are mainly attributable to decreased radiocesium transfer intensity from the benthic food web because of lowered radiocesium contamination in sediments, and low physiological ability to retain radiocesium. Our results revealed a strong contrast of radiocesium contamination levels and mechanisms between marine and freshwater fish in natural habitats. Particularly, a close relation between 137Cs accumulation in river salmon and contamination of prey items in forest ecosystems (mainly terrestrial and aquatic insects) is peculiar to the upstream areas affected by the Fukushima accident."

The effect of sample position in the smoking chamber was also studied. The margin of exposure (MoE) approach was used for assessing the risk of dietary exposure to PAHs from smoked fish products. The study material comprised of sprat, herring, mackerel, and salmon from a fish processing plant equipped with smoking chambers with external smoke generators. None of the smoked fish products studied exceeded the new, stricter limits set for BaP and PAH4. The MoE indicators far exceed the limit of 10,000 (values lower than this indicate a potential risk to consumer health). The sensory analysis identified significant differences among the products studied that indicate the high quality of cold‐smoked salmon fillets and the statistically significant lower quality of a smoked salmon abdominal parts. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In 2011 and 2015, the European Commission amended Regulation No. 1881/2006, setting new maximum levels for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in food products in order to protect consumer safety. The currently applicable limits are: for benzo(a)pyrene—2.0 μg/kg and for the sum of benzo(a)pyrene, benz(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, and chrysene—12.0 μg/kg in muscle meat of smoked fish and smoked fishery products with the exception of smoked, canned smoked sprat, smoked, and canned smoked Baltic herring ≤ 14 cm, where the limits are, respectively, 5.0 μg/kg and 30.0 μg/kg. The presented study was to determine if the sprat, herring, mackerel, and salmon from a fish processing plant equipped with smoking chambers with external smoke generators comply with the new, stricter limits set for BaP and PAH4 by Regulation No. 835/2011 and No. 2015/1125. The results showed that none of 54 smoked fish products that had been examined exceeded the new, stricter limits set for BaP and PAH4 and also that changes in PAH4 content depending on the position of the product in the smoking chamber were statistically insignificant, what is important information for processing plants.

Microbial growth and activity are responsible for up to 25% of food losses in the fishery industry. In this context and to meet consumer demand for minimally processed food, developing mild preservation technologies such as biopreservation represents a major challenge. In this work, we studied the use of six lactic acid bacteria (LAB), previously selected for their properties as bioprotective agents, for salmon dill gravlax biopreservation. Naturally contaminated salmon dill gravlax slices, with a commercial shelf-life of 21 days, were purchased from a French industrial company and inoculated by spraying with the protective cultures (PCs) to reach an initial concentration of 106 log CFU/g. PC impact on gravlax microbial ecosystem (cultural and acultural methods), sensory properties (sensory profiling test), biochemical parameters (pH, TMA, TVBN, biogenic amines) and volatilome was followed for 25 days of storage at 8°C in vacuum packaging. PC antimicrobial activity was also assessed in situ against Listeria monocytogenes. This polyphasic approach underlined two scenarios depending on the protective strain. Carnobacterium maltaromaticum SF1944, Lactococcus piscium EU2229 and Leuconostoc gelidum EU2249, were very competitive in the product, dominated the microbial ecosystem, and displayed antimicrobial activity against the spoilage microbiota and L. monocytogenes. The strains also expressed their own sensory and volatilome signatures. However, of these three strains, C. maltaromaticum SF1944 did not induce strong spoilage and was the most efficient for L. monocytogenes growth control. By contrast, Vagococcus fluvialis CD264, Carnobacterium inhibens MIP2551 and Aerococcus viridans SF1044 were not competitive, did not express strong antimicrobial activity and produced only few organic volatile compounds (VOCs). However, V. fluvialis CD264 was the only strain to extend the sensory quality, even beyond 25 days. This study shows that C. maltaromaticum SF1944 and V. fluvialis CD264 both have a promising potential as bioprotective cultures to ensure salmon gravlax microbial safety and sensorial quality, respectively."

The intake of these globally distributed and bioaccumulative contaminants depends on both consumption patterns (which seafoods are consumed) and on their origins. Here, we investigate exposure to PBDEs through seafood consumption as a function of species, origins and consumption levels. We estimate the contribution of seafood consumption to PBDE exposures in the Swiss population using two approaches. The first approach estimates exposures by estimating the composition of the Swiss seafood diet using trade data and national statistics on total seafood consumption. This naïve approach could be used for any country for which no individually reported consumption data are available for a population. The second approach uses dietary survey data provided by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office as part of the menuCH study for exposure estimates. To support region- and species-specific estimates of exposures for both approaches, we built a database of PBDE concentrations in seafood by analysis of published PBDE levels in fish from food markets or freshwater resources from various countries. We find estimated PBDE exposures ranging from 0.15 to 0.65 ng/kg bw/day for the trade data-based diet. These were close to the median exposures of 0.68 ng/kg bw/day for the Swiss population based on the menuCH survey, indicating that the composition and consumption rate derived from trade data are appropriate for calculating exposures in the average adult population. However, it could not account for PBDE exposures of more vulnerable (high seafood consuming) populations captured only by the survey data. All estimates were lower than the PBDE Chronic Oral Reference Doses (RfD's) suggested by the EPA, but could increase substantially to a value of 7 ng/kg bw/day if fish are sourced from the most contaminated origins, as in the case of Vietnamese shrimp/prawn, Norwegian salmon, and Swiss whitefish. Exposures as high as 8.50 ng/kg bw/day are estimated for the survey-based diet, which better captures the variability in consumption by individuals, including extreme high and low values. In general, the most frequently consumed species reported by Swiss consumers are consistent with those predicted using trade data."

Flesh residue concentrations (ng/g wet weight) of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), chlordanes, chlorobenzenes (CBz) and cyclodiene pesticides (e. g. , dieldrin, mirex) were 2 to 11 times higher (p < 0.05) in farmed salmon compared with wild salmon. Concentrations were positively correlated with flesh lipid levels. Farmed Atlantic salmon (12-15% lipid) typically exhibited the greatest OCP burdens compared with other salmon species. However, when expressed on a lipid weight basis, concentrations of OCPs (ng/g lipid weight) in wild salmon, in many cases, exceeded those levels in farmed salmon. Observed interspecies and site-specific variations of OCP concentrations in farmed and wild salmon may be attributed to divergent life history, prey/feed characteristics and composition, bioenergetics, or ambient environmental concentrations. Calculated biomagnification factors (BMF = C(F)/C(D), lipid wt) of OCPs in farmed salmon typically ranged between two and five. Biomagnification of chemicals such as DDTs, chlordanes, and mirex was anticipated, because those compounds tend to exhibit high dietary uptake and slow depuration rates in fish because of relatively high octanol-water partition coefficients (K(OW)s > 10⁵). Surprisingly, less hydrophobic pesticides such as hexachlorocyclohexanes and endosulfans (K(OW) s < 10⁵) consistently exhibited a high degree of biomagnification in farmed salmon species (BMFs > 5). This is contrary to previous laboratory and field observations demonstrating fish BMFs less than 1 for low K(OW) chemicals, because of efficient respiratory elimination of those compounds via gills. The results suggest that ambient seawater concentrations and bioconcentration-driven accumulation may play a key role in the bioaccumulation of these relatively more water-soluble contaminants in farmed salmon. Finally, OCP exposure through consumption of British Columbian salmon is found to be low relative to United States national average per capita total exposure levels and provisional tolerable daily intakes."

Notably, L. monocytogenes was not detected in raw freshwater food. The L. monocytogenes isolates belonged to four serotypes, 1/2a, 1/2b, 1/2c, and 4b, with the most prevalent serotype being 1/2a (47.9%). Eighteen sequence types (STs) and eighteen virulence types (VTs) containing four newly assigned VTs (VT180, VT181, VT182, and VT183) were determined via multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST). Among the 73 L. monocytogenes isolates, 23 (31.5%) belonged to epidemic clones (ECs) including ECI, ECIV, ECV, ECVI, ECVIII and ECXI among which ECV was predominant. Antibiotic susceptibility tests revealed a high resistance rate (11.0%) to tetracycline. Moreover, we identified the distribution patterns of virulence genes of four Listeria pathogenicity islands (LIPI) in L. monocytogenes isolates. prfA, hly, plcA, plcB, mpl, actA genes in LIPI-1 and inlA, inlB, inlC, inlJ genes in LIPI-2 were detected in approximately all L. monocytogenes isolates. The distribution of both LIPI-3 genes and LIPI-4 genes exhibited association with lineage and ST. LIPI-4 genes were present exclusively in ST87 isolates. Relatedness analysis revealed the absence of distinct association between STs, ECs, LIPI-3 and LIPI-4 distribution and specific food groups.

We used a sequence of experiments increasing in complexity: (i) small salmon blocks salted, smoked or dried under model conditions, (ii) fillets of salmon cold-smoked in a pilot plant and finally, (iii) assessment of the bacterial levels before and after processing during commercial scale production. L. monocytogenes proliferated on salmon blocks that were brined or dipped in liquid smoke and left at 25 degrees C in a humidity chamber for 24 h. However, combining brining and liquid smoke with a drying (25 degrees C) step reduced the bacterium 10-100 fold over a 24 h period. Non-salted, brine injected or dry salted salmon fillets were surface inoculated with L. monocytogenes and cold-smoked in a pilot plant. L. monocytogenes was reduced from 10(3) to 10-10(2) CFU/cm(2) immediately after cold-smoking. The greatest reductions were observed in dry salted and brine injected fillets as compared to cold-smoking of non-salted fresh fillets. Levels of L. monocytogenes decreased further when the cold-smoked fish was vacuum-packed and stored at 5 degrees C. A similar decline was seen when inoculating brine injected fillets after cold-smoking. High phenol concentrations are a likely cause of this marked growth inhibition. In a commercial production facility, the total viable count of salmon fillets was reduced 10-1000 fold by salting, cold-smoking and process-freezing (a freezing step after smoking and before slicing). The prevalence of L. monocytogenes in the commercial production facility was too low to determine any quantitative effects, however, one of nine samples was positive before processing and none after. Taken together, the processing steps involved in cold-smoking of salmon are bactericidal and reduce, but do not eliminate L. monocytogenes. A persistent strain was no less sensitive to the processing steps than a clinical strain or strain EGD."

First, Carnobacterium piscicola, Photobacterium phosphoreum, Lactobacillus sakei, Vibrio sp. , Brochothrix thermosphacta and Serratia liquefaciens-like were inoculated as pure cultures on sterile cold-smoked salmon. All bacterial species grew well; Vibrio sp. was the fastest and L. sakei strains developed very rapidly as well with a high maximum cell density on cold-smoked salmon blocks (up to 10(9) cfu g(-1) after 10 days at 8 degrees C). Based on sensory analysis, Vibrio sp. was identified as non-spoilage bacteria, C. piscicola as very lightly and B. thermosphacta as lightly spoiling. L. sakei and S. liquefaciens-like were found to be the most spoiling bacteria. Secondly, C. piscicola and L. sakei, two species frequently occurring in the lactic flora of the product, were inoculated together and each of them in mixed cultures with respectively P. phosphoreum, Vibrio sp. , B. thermosphacta, and S. liquefaciens-like. The growth of L. sakei was shown to strongly inhibit most of the co-inoculated strains i. e. P. phosphoreum, B. thermosphacta, S. liquefaciens-like and, to a lesser extent, Vibrio sp. The growth of C. piscicola seemed to be enhanced with B. thermosphacta and to develop earlier with P. phosphoreum and Vibrio sp. Conversely, S. liquefaciens-like and P. phosphoreum were weakly inhibited by C. piscicola. The main observation resulting from the sensory evaluation was the delay in the appearance of the spoilage characteristics in the mixed cultures with L. sakei, in particular L. sakei/ S. liquefaciens-like. On the other hand, the spoilage activity of the non-spoiler strains Vibrio sp. or the moderate spoilage strains B. thermosphacta and C. piscicola was increased when they were associated together. It is concluded that the spoilage behaviour of micro-organisms in mixed culture is significantly different from pure culture and explain the difficulty to find robust quality indices for this product."

The effect of slicing temperature (0 degrees C, 10 degrees C and room temperature), inoculum level (approx. 3, 5 and 8 log CFU/blade), and attachment time of inoculum to blade (10 min and 2.5 h) were investigated and predictive models of the transfer were produced. In the tests of transfer from inoculated blade (5.9-9.0 log CFU/blade) initially 2.5-5.3 log CFU/g was present on the slices, slowly decreasing to an overall average decrease of 1.6+/-0.2 log CFU/g during slicing of 39 slices; the lowest reduction being 1.3 log CFU/g at 0 degrees C. In tests of transfer from contaminated salmon (7.6+/-0.1 log CFU/fillet) to uninoculated blade and further to uninoculated salmon, the reduction in number of L. monocytogenes in slices was 1.5 log CFU/g during slicing of 39 slices. For example 5.3+/-0.3 log CFU/g was transferred to second slice when the inoculum level was 8.4+/-0.4 log CFU/blade, but clearly (p<0.05) lower total number of L. monocytogenes were transferred to slices when the inoculum level was lower, the temperature was colder or the attachment time was longer. There was a progressive exponential reduction in the quantity of L. monocytogenes transferred and, based on statistical parameters, an exponential model (y=ae((-x/b))) fit the data from different test conditions and was suitable for predicting an expected number of L. monocytogenes on the salmon slices. Based on the predicted values, the logarithmic reduction in number of L. monocytogenes in slices was highest at room temperature with an inoculum level of 8.4+/-0.4 log CFU/blade (attachment time 10 min); the other test conditions differed significantly from this (p<0.05). Despite statistically significant differences, in all test conditions the number of bacteria were predicted to reduce quite rapidly (i. e. after slicing of the fourth fillet) to <1 log CFU/g, though this prediction was an extrapolation after 39 slices. The predictive models described herein can assist salmon processors and regulatory agencies in assessing cross-contamination from contaminated slicing machines to product and in designing risk management strategies."

The experimental design allowed CO2 to enter the salmon muscle before (soluble gas stabilization [SGS] + vacuum) or after pasteurization (CO2 emitter + vacuum), whereas the control samples (vacuum only) were not presented for CO2. This setup resulted in six different groups; three heated with microwaves and three with conventional pasteurization. The core temperature of microwave samples was 58.8 ± 2.2 °C, whereas the surface temperature was equal to the oven temperature (62 °C) during conventional pasteurization and close to the core temperature during microwave pasteurization (57.6 ± 1.4 °C). Microwave-heated samples showed higher microbial growth; decreased shelf life; and darker (lower L* -value), more reddish (higher a* -value), and yellowish (higher b* -value) colors compared to conventional-heated salmon. Lowest liquid loss (LL) was observed in salmon packaged with the CO2 emitter, whereas a SGS step prior to pasteurization did not affect the LL negatively as compared to samples packaged in vacuum only. Treatment with CO2 , independent of the prestep using SGS or an emitter, resulted in increased shelf life. Protein denaturation, microbial growth, product color, product shelf life, and sensory properties of the salmon loin were significantly affected by the applied pasteurization method (microwave- or conventional pasteurization). However, the heat load was probably too high to detect differences resulting from the pretreatment using SGS or packaging with CO2 emitter. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Recent developments with increased time pressure from both work and past time activities have led to a tremendous increase in the demand for convenient, tasty ready-to-use food options. Furthermore, contemporary trends for consumption of fresh or lightly processed seafood stress the need to develop processing methods that allow a fulfillment of these demands, while still offering a reasonable shelf life. Carbon dioxide in combination with either microwave or conventional pasteurization is innovative processing technology that can meet consumer's demand of such products."

Samples were collected at day 21, 28, 35, 52, 49 and 56 after the start of the exposure. Note that days 49 and 56 represent end of exposure and 1 week after a recovery period, respectively. Tissue bioaccumulations were determined by HPLC/MS/MS, steroid hormones, fatty acids (FAs) and lipids were determined by GC-MS, while mRNA expression levels of genes were determined by qPCR in whole body homogenate. We observed that PFOS and PFOA showed a steady increase in whole body burden during the exposure period, with a slight decrease after the recovery period. Calculated somatic indexes showed that PFOA produced increases in heart-, thymus-, liver- and kidney somatic indexes (HSI, TSI, LSI and KSI). PFOA and PFOS exposure produced significant decreases in whole body dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), estrone and testosterone at sampling day 21 and a strong increase of cortisol and cholesterol at the end of recovery period (day 56). PFOA and PFOS effects differed with DHEA and estrone. While PFOS decreased DHEA levels, PFOA produced an increase at day 49, and while PFOS decreased estrone, PFOA produced a slight increase at day 56. We observed changes in FA composition that predominantly involved increases in FA methyl esters (FAMEs), mono- and poly-unsaturated FA (MUFA and PUFA) and a decrease in n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio by both PFOA and PFOS. Particularly, an increase in - pentadecenoic MUFA (15:1), two n-3 PUFAs α-linolenic acid [ALA: 18:3 n3] and eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA: 20:5 n-3] and n-6 PUFA: arachidonic acid [ARA: 20:4 n6], docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) by PFOA and PFOS were observed.

The two complementary analysis methods are used to investigate congener composition pattern differences between species, trophic levels, feeding preferences, and farmed or wild feeding regimes, with the intent of better understanding PCB processes in both salmon and salmon consumers. PCA supports classification of PCB congeners into nine groups based on a) structure activity groups (SAG) related to the bioaccumulation potential in fish-eating mammals, b) Cl number, and c) the numbers of vicinal meta- and para-H. All three factors are needed to interpret congener distributions since SAGs by themselves do not fully explain PCB distributions. Farmed salmon exhibit very similar congener patterns that overlap the PCA and Aroclor composition of their food, while wild salmon separate into two distinct groups, with chinook and ""coastal"" coho having higher proportions of the higher chlorinated, Aroclor 1260 type, nonmetabolizable congeners, and chum, pink, sockeye, and ""remote"" coho having higher proportions of the lower chlorinated, more volatile and metabolizable Aroclor 1242 type, congeners. Wild chinook have the highest PCB and toxic equivalent (TEQ) concentrations, and the highest proportions of A1254 A1260, and PCB congeners in the most refractory SAG. Because both ""coastal"" and ""remote"" coho groups are likely to be consuming prey of similar size and trophic level, the PCB delivery mechanism (e. g. , atmosphere vs runoff) apparently has more influence on the salmon PCB profile than biotransformation, suggesting that the wild chinook PCB profile is determined by feeding preference. Overall, wild salmon distributions primarily relate to trophic level, feeding preferences, and longevity, while metabolism appears at most a minor factor. The new classification protocol takes better advantage of individual congener PCB analyses and provides a better framework for understanding the PCB distributions in salmon and, potentially, the movement of individual PCB congeners through marine food chains than previous classification schemes."

Cold-smoked salmon with Verdad N6 added in the dry-salting process was produced. Salmon fillets were surface contaminated with a mix of L. monocytogenes. Levels of L. monocytogenes were determined during vacuum pack refrigerated storage for 29 days. The use of Verdad N6 resulted in increased lag times and reduced growth rates of L. monocytogenes. The inhibitory effects were dependent on Verdad N6 levels (0-2%), storage time and temperature (4 or 8 °C), type of contamination (between slices or on non-sliced salmon) and degree of smoking. The presence of dextrose (1%) in the recipe had no significant effects on L. monocytogenes levels after storage. On sliced salmon, complete growth inhibition at 4 °C storage could be obtained using 1% Verdad N6 compared to a 3 log increase in L. monocytogenes counts in control salmon. At abuse temperatures (8 °C), corresponding L. monocytogenes levels increased <2 log and 5-6 log during 29 days storage. On non-sliced salmon, 1% Verdad N6 provided complete growth reductions at 4 and 8 °C storage while L. monocytogenes in control salmon increased 2.3 and 4.6 log, respectively, in the same period. The use of Verdad N6 in combination with bactericidal UV-C treatments (fluence 50 mJ/cm2) provided an initial 0.8 log reduction and complete L. monocytogenes growth inhibition on subsequent storage at 4 and 8 °C. Salmon with Verdad N6 showed reduced levels of total counts during storage and a shift in the dominating bacteria with reduced and increased relative levels of Photobacterium and lactic acid bacteria, respectively. A consumer test showed no consistent differences in liking of salmon with and without Verdad N6. In summary, Verdad N6 is an option for the production of high quality cold-smoked salmon with enhanced food safety through its robust listeriostatic effects.

Thalli of L. digitata growing wild, cultivated as a single species (mono-cultivated), and cultivated alongside organic Irish salmon aquaculture facilities (IMTA) were analysed for metal content (As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Sb, V, Zn). Cultivation in an IMTA context raised the content of Cu, Mn and V relative to that in mono-cultivated seaweeds however concentrations of metals were within the range of those from algae collected from undisturbed wild populations. Metal levels in the seaweeds do not pose a concern over inclusion as a dietary component with the possible exception of arsenic that exceeded some legislative limits. The results of this study provide novel information that can inform policy and sustainable aquaculture management practices aimed at reducing contamination of the aquatic environment and the impact on consumers. This study provides the first comparative investigation of metals in seaweed from different cultivation environments and can be used to support best-practice management decisions involving IMTA.

Such factors may affect reproductive success of fish stocks. This study investigates chemical contaminant burdens and select gene expression profiles in Pacific Sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) and Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) salmon which traverse the Fraser River watershed during their spawning migration. Chemical analyses of muscle tissue and eggs of salmon collected from the lower Fraser River (pre-migration) and from upstream spawning grounds (post-migration) during the 2007 migration revealed the presence of numerous chemical contaminants, including PCBs, dioxins/furans, pesticides, and heavy metals. However, muscle tissue residue concentrations were well below human health consumption guidelines and 2,3,7,8 TCDD toxic equivalents (SigmaTEQs) in salmon eggs, calculated using WHO toxic equivalency factors (WHO-TEFs) for fish health, did not exceed the 0.3pgg(-1) wet weight toxicological threshold level previously associated with 30% egg mortality in salmon populations. Quantitative real-time PCR probes were generated and used to assess differences in abundance of key mRNA transcripts encoding nine gene products associated with reproduction, stress, metal toxicity, and exposure to environmental contaminants. Gene expression profiles were characterized in liver and muscle tissue of pre- and post-migration Sockeye and Chinook salmon. The results of stock-matched animals indicate that dynamic changes in mRNA levels occur for a number of genes in both species during migration and suggest that Sockeye salmon exhibit a greater level of biological stress compared to the Chinook salmon population. Using a male-specific genotypic marker, we found that out of the 154 animals examined, one Sockeye was genotypically male but phenotypically female. This individual's gene expression profile in liver and muscle was reminiscent of, but not identical to, the female expression profile. These studies provide the first glimpse of the dynamic yet common nature of changes in the transcriptome that are shared between species during in-migration and highlight differences that may relate to population success. Continued longitudinal assessment will further define the association between contaminant burden, physiological stress, and modulation of gene expression in migrating Pacific salmon."

Growth or inactivation was not included in the model. The model was run through Monte Carlo simulations using the @Risk software (Palisade Corporation). The probability of illness per serving was calculated using two dose-response models from the literature. The first was an exponential model in which the species specific constant R, that helps define the dose-response curve, previously has been estimated to be 1.18 x 10(-10) based on German data (GR). In this study, R was estimated to 5.6 x 10(-10) based on Swedish data. The second model was a flexible Weibull-Gamma model (WG), with different coefficients for high- and low-risk groups. The exponential model (GR), although conservative and generally overestimating the risk, still predicted a lower probability of illness than the WG-model. The estimated mean risk per serving was 2.8 x 10(-5) (GR, high-risk group), 2.0 x 10(-3) (WG, low-risk group) and 0.016 (WG, high-risk group), respectively. The average number of reported listeriosis cases in Sweden is 37 per year.

PBDE concentrations can be particularly high in resident Chinook salmon (Onchorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Puget Sound, Washington. Although PBDE residues in salmon and other fish are often dominated by lower brominated congeners, these congeners are not produced commercially in the greatest quantity, suggesting bioaccumulation of the lower molecular weight PBDEs or debromination of more fully brominated congeners. We determined the capacity of Chinook liver fractions to debrominate 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 99), a model PBDE congener readily debrominated by common carp (Cyprinus caprio). Liver subcellular fractions from two strains of Chinook were incubated with BDE 99 prior to liquid/liquid extraction followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis (GC/MS analysis) to identify metabolites and debromination products. In contrast to common carp, debromination of BDE 99 to BDE 47 (2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether) was not observed in microsomal fractions from either strain of Chinook salmon. However, Chinook salmon liver microsomes from both Chinook strains slowly debrominated BDE 99 to BDE 49 (2,2',4,5'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether), a unique debromination product whose formation has not been reported in other fish. Three-year-old males belonging to a Rapid River Spring Chinook salmon genetic strain showed a somewhat greater microsomal debromination capacity than older hatchery returning male Chinook, but were still inefficient in the debromination of BDE 99 relative to carp. Microsomal debromination of BDE 99 to BDE 49 was not NADPH-dependent, indicating a lack of cytochrome P450 involvement. By contrast, omission of the reductant dithiothreitol (DTT) from Chinook microsomal preparations resulted in a lack of BDE 99 debromination, suggesting the involvement of a microsomal reductase(s) or deiodinase (DI). Cytosolic fractions from Chinook salmon and Common carp debrominated BDE 99 to BDE 49 in vitro. However, carp cytosolic enzymes preferentially formed BDE 47. In summary, our data indicate significant differences among teleosts with respect to efficiency and metabolite profiles of BDE 99 debromination, and suggest that the high concentrations of BDE 47 in resident Chinook salmon from the Puget Sound are not a result of hepatic metabolism of BDE 99. The results of our study also suggest the involvement of an unidentified hepatic reductase or DI in PBDE debromination in fish."

Both the benefits and the risks from eating fish are publicized. Most of this attention has focused on recreational anglers and self-caught fish, although the vast majority of fish that people eat are purchased from commercial sources: fish markets and supermarkets. We examined the availability of fish in supermarkets and specialty fish markets in New Jersey, including three regions of the state in communities with high and low per capita incomes (upscale vs. downscale neighborhoods). We were particularly interested in examining whether consumers could determine what type of fish they were buying and whether it was farm-raised or wild. Flounder and salmon were the most commonly available fish, followed by bluefish and tilapia. There were few significant differences in the availability of fish as a function of region. Fish were equally available in fish markets and supermarkets, although snappers were more available in fish markets. The most common fish (found in over 60% of stores) were equally available in upscale and downscale neighborhood stores. However, there were some significant differences in less common fish; butterfish, croaker, monkfish, porgy, and whiting were more available in downscale markets, and halibut, sole, and swordfish were more available in upscale markets. Information available to consumers on labels varied markedly: (1) most labels were generic but some indicated species (e. g. , Spanish vs. Boston mackerel, Chilean vs. Black sea bass, mako vs. black-tip shark, rainbow vs. steelhead trout); (2) in many cases, labels indicated whether catfish or salmon were farmed or wild, but usually that information was lacking; (3) sometimes, the labels indicated the location where fish were caught (salmon); and (4) sometimes, there was information on both species and type (e. g. , farm/wild for salmon). In most cases, labels gave only a fish name and price. Consumers would be able to make more informed choices if the provenance of fish was clearly stated. State agencies might improve information available to consumers by providing distributors and markets with guidelines about the types of information necessary for consumers to make informed decisions about the fish they eat. When asked, counter staff often could not answer where fish originated from. Finally, there should be partnerships between government agencies responsible for public health, risk assessors, and consumers to ascertain the types of information consumers want and to provide the best available information to consumers."

The assessment accounted for spatial and temporal distribution of 6 acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting insecticides in salmonid habitat within the basin and their relative contributions to mixture toxicity estimated from chemical monitoring data. The 6 insecticides were chlorpyrifos, diazinon, malathion, carbaryl, carbofuran, and methomyl. Seasonal distributions of the juvenile salmon prey base across the basin were determined and compared to co-occurrence with the insecticide mixture to determine the probability of prey reduction and reduced production of juvenile fish. Probability of effect on freshwater aquatic invertebrates was based on acute toxicity species sensitivity distributions (normalized to the most potent compound, chlorpyrifos) using a novel approach to apply the toxicological concept of concentration addition to species sensitivity distributions with differing slopes. The chlorpyrifos distribution was then used to determine relative sensitivity among various species tested within the important taxa making up the prey base. A prey base index was devised, incorporating diet composition and prey availability, to evaluate the indirect effects of the insecticide mixture on juvenile salmon production occurring as a result of a reduction in the prey base. Our analysis targeted fish use of backwater and off-channel habitat units, because they generally coincide with agricultural lands in lowlands and represent shallow habitat with limited water exchange. The percentage of agricultural land use within 300 m of critical habitat stream reaches was used to scale chemical measurement data from a site with high agricultural land use across the full extent of the basin to provide estimates of chemical exposure in each reach. Seasonal impacts were evaluated from mean monthly concentrations. Stressor impact on 5 key taxa was evaluated at each time step and for each reach, and the outcome was compared to a conservation threshold assigned to the prey base index. Only 13% of juveniles reared in backwater, off-channel habitat within 300 m of agricultural land. Percent reduction of carrying capacity as a consequence of reduced prey was estimated to be 5% over the entire brood year. This can be considered lost capacity that is probably compensated elsewhere via increased occupancy (emigration to other habitat units within the reach), which is not accounted for in the model."

On the other hand, oily seafood also contains persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including the dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like-polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs), potentially detrimental to human health. For a comprehensive comparison of the beneficial and potentially adverse health effects of seafood consumption, risk-benefit analyses are necessary. Risk-benefit analyses require reliable quantitative data and sound knowledge of uncertainties and potential biases. Our dataset comprised more than 4000 analyses of DLCs and more than 1000 analyses each of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and vitamin D in the three most important Norwegian commercial oily seafood species: Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). The levels of several DLC congeners were below the limit of quantification (LOQ), making estimation of true levels challenging. We demonstrate that the use of upper bound substitution of censored data will overestimate, while lower bound substitution will underestimate the actual levels of DLCs. Therefore, we implement an alternative robust statistical method by combining Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Regression on Order Statistics and Kaplan-Meier analyses, which is better suited for providing estimations of levels of these contaminants in seafood. Moreover, we illustrate the impact of the toxic equivalency factor (TEF) system on estimation of the sums of DLCs by comparing the TEF system to an alternative system of relative effect potency (REP) factors (Consensus Toxicity Factors). The levels of nutrients and contaminants were related to adequate intake (AI) and tolerable weekly intake (TWI), respectively. We used AI and the TWI values established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The benefit and the risk were further viewed in the context of the Norwegian average intake of oily fish, and the Norwegian governmental official dietary recommendations of oily fish. Our results showed that both benefit and risk are met at the levels found of nutrients and DLCs in oily seafood. The comprehensive quantitative data presented here will be a key for future risk-benefit assessment of oily fish consumption. Together, our results underline that a refined formalized integrative risk-benefit assessment of oily fish in the diet is warranted, and that the data and methodology presented in this study are highly relevant for future integrated and multidisciplinary assessment of both risks and benefits of seafood consumption for human health."

Methods are needed to better understand the causes of these kills. The Pesticide Root Zone Model and the Exposure Analysis Modeling System were used to compare risk to resident biota in estuarine headwaters in two locations under various conditions. Contaminants were selected using a landuse-based preliminary risk assessment approach. Atrazine, fipronil, and imidacloprid were compared for potential impacts on important prey species, including copepods and grass shrimp, in Lake Bethel in Volusia County, Florida. Carbaryl, diquat dibromide, and fluoranthene were compared for potential impacts on salmon and other aquatic species in Johnson Creek, near Portland, Oregon. Predictions of contaminant concentrations in groundwater runoff, surface water, benthic sediments, and pelagic biota tissue were obtained based upon watershed characteristics, storm types, and contaminant chemistry and application. For all six contaminants, the simulated concentrations were highest following the 100-yr storms and lowest following the 2-yr storms. Aqueous concentrations ranged between 84 and 2100% higher in 100-yr compared to two-yr storms. Most atrazine and carbaryl concentrations were highest if applied one day before the storm while fipronil, imidacloprid, and diquat dibromide were highest if applied 16 days prior to the storm. Carbaryl and fluoranthene concentrations were highest in the forested segment of the watershed while diquat dibromide concentrations were highest in the agricultural segment. In Florida simulations, groundwater and surface water concentrations generally were highest for atrazine, followed by imidacloprid, and then fipronil. Atrazine poses the highest risk to algae and copepods due to its mobility and high allowable application rates. Fipronil and imidacloprid, though highly toxic, were not predicted to occur at high enough concentrations to pose a risk. In Oregon simulations, groundwater and surface water concentrations generally were highest for carbaryl, followed by fluoranthene, and then diquat dibromide. For salmonids, fluoranthene poses a higher risk than carbaryl, whereas it is unlikely that diquat dibromide will affect salmonids in this system. For crustaceans, carbaryl poses the greatest risk, followed by fluoranthene. Diquat dibromide was determined to pose little risk. These tests demonstrate the use of preliminary risk assessment, along with transport and fate modeling, to characterize risks to aquatic organisms without the need for in situ chemical measurements."

The data set comprised isolates from nine meat and six salmon processing facilities in Norway collected over a period of three decades. The most prevalent clonal complex (CC) was CC121, found in 10 factories, followed by CC7, CC8, and CC9, found in 7 factories each. Overall, 72% of the isolates were classified as persistent, showing 20 or fewer wgMLST allelic differences toward an isolate found in the same factory in a different calendar year. Moreover, over half of the isolates (56%) showed this level of genetic similarity toward an isolate collected from a different food processing facility. These were designated as pervasive strains, defined as clusters with the same level of genetic similarity as persistent strains but isolated from different factories. The prevalence of genetic determinants associated with increased survival in food processing environments, including heavy metal and biocide resistance determinants, stress response genes, and inlA truncation mutations, showed a highly significant increase among pervasive isolates but not among persistent isolates. Furthermore, these genes were significantly more prevalent among the isolates from food processing environments compared to in isolates from natural and rural environments (n = 218) and clinical isolates (n = 111) from Norway. IMPORTANCE Listeria monocytogenes can persist in food processing environments for months to decades and spread through the food system by, e. g. , contaminated raw materials. Knowledge of the distribution and diversity of L. monocytogenes is important in outbreak investigations and is essential to effectively track and control this pathogen in the food system. The present study presents a comprehensive overview of the prevalence of persistent clones and of the diversity of L. monocytogenes in Norwegian food processing facilities. The results demonstrate extensive spread of highly similar strains throughout the Norwegian food system, in that 56% of the 769 collected isolates from food processing factories belonged to clusters of L. monocytogenes identified in more than one facility. These strains were associated with an overall increase in the prevalence of plasmids and determinants of heavy metal and biocide resistance, as well as other genetic elements associated with stress survival mechanisms and persistence."

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration website provides methylmercury data for a variety of fish, but for many species sample sizes are small and data are more than a decade old, whereas commercial fish sources are highly dynamic. A few state agencies are beginning to provide contaminant information for commercial fish, including canned tuna. We examined the mercury concentration of six types of fish purchased in supermarkets in Chicago, Illinois in 2005. We measured total mercury (methylmercury accounts for about 90% of the total mercury in fish). One key question was whether the concentrations of mercury in fish available locally were similar to those reported in other areas of the country and in the FDA U. S. national data base. Such information is critical for the public, especially pregnant women or those planning on pregnancy, making decisions about types and quantities of fish to consume. Some fish are available generally throughout the U. S. , but others are more locally available, suggesting a need for site-specific information. This research was stakeholder driven, and reflected local interest in the safety of local fish. There were significant differences in mercury concentrations among the fish, ranging from a mean of 0.03 microg/g (ppm-wet weight) for salmon (Salmo spp. ) to 1.41 ppm for swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Maximum values for three species of fish (orange roughy Hoplostethus atianticus, swordfish walleye Sander vitreus) were over 1 ppm (FDA action level), and all of the fish except salmon had some values above 0.5 ppm, the action level set by some states and countries. There were significant differences in mercury concentrations among three types of canned tuna (Thunnus spp): ""gourmet tuna"" had the least amount of mercury, and white tuna had the most. The mean concentrations reported in this study were generally similar to those reported by the FDA, but there were important differences: 1) although the mean mercury concentrations for orange roughy for the Chicago data was similar to the FDA data, the maximum concentration was higher; 2) the mean for the Chicago swordfish was higher than the FDA data (1.26 vs 0.97 ppm, methylmercury); 3) the maximum for tuna steaks was higher in the FDA data set; and, 4) mean values for grouper (Epinephelus spp. ) were higher in the FDA data set than the Chicago data. Further, the FDA has virtually no data on walleye and none on ""gourmet tuna"". These conclusions suggest that there are enough variations between the local data (Chicago) and the FDA data to warrant periodic local monitoring of commercial fish to provide up-to-date information to consumers about mercury in the fish they eat."

The increased use of QACs is concerning as exposure from inhalation or ingestion to these compounds that has been associated with adverse effects on the reproductive and respiratory systems. Humans are exposed to QACs primarily by food consumption and inhalation of air. QAC residues pose significant threats to public health. Given the importance of assessing potential residue levels for QACs in food, therefore, a method was developed for the simultaneous detection of six common QACs and one emerging QAC (Ephemora) in frozen food by ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) coupled with the modified QuEChERS method. The main factors governing the response, recovery, and sensitivity of the method, including extraction solvents, types and dosages of adsorbents, apparatus conditions, and mobile phases, were optimized in the course of sample pretreatment and instrument analysis. QAC residues in frozen food were extracted using 20 mL methanol-water (90∶10, containing 0.5% formic acid) for 20 min by the vortex shock method. The mixture was ultrasonicated for 10 min and centrifuged at 10000 r/min for 10 min. A 1-mL aliquot of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and purified using 100 mg of PSA adsorbents. After mixing and centrifugation at 10000 r/min for 5 min, the purified solution was analyzed. Target analytes were separated on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C8 chromatographic column (50 mm×2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) at a column temperature of 40 ℃ and a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The injection volume was 1 μL. Gradient elution was performed using methanol and 5 mmol/L ammonium acetate solution as the mobile phases. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was conducted in the positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) mode. The matrix-matched external standard method was used to quantify seven QACs. The optimized chromatography-based method completely separated the seven analytes. Good linear relationships were obtained for the seven QACs in the range of 0.1-100.0 ng/mL. The correlation coefficient (r2) ranged from 0.9971 to 0.9983. The limits of detection and limits of quantification ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 μg/kg and 1.5 to 3.0 μg/kg, respectively. Accuracy and precision were determined by spiking salmon and chicken samples with 3.0, 10.0, and 100.0 μg/kg of analytes, in compliance with the current legislation, with six replicates per determination. The average recoveries of the seven QACs ranged from 65.4% to 101%. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) were between 0.64% and 16.8%. Matrix effects of the analytes were between -27.5% and 33.4% in salmon and chicken samples after purifying using PSA. The developed method was applied to the determination of seven QACs in rural samples. QACs were detected in only one sample; the level did not exceed European Food Safety Authority specified residue limit standards. The detection method has high sensitivity, good selectivity and stability, and the results are accurate and reliable. It is suitable for the simultaneous rapid determination of seven QAC residues in frozen food. The results provide valuable information for future risk assessment studies targeting this class of compounds."

Their presence is derived from consumption of medicines, disposal of expired medications, release of treated and untreated urban effluents, and from the pharmaceutical industry. Their growing use has become an alarming environmental problem which potentially will become dangerous in the future. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about long-term effects in non-target organisms as well as for human health. Toxicity testing has indicated a relatively low acute toxicity to fish species, but no information is available on possible sublethal effects. This study provides data on the physiological pathways involved in the exposure of Atlantic salmon as representative test species to three pharmaceutical compounds found in ground, surface, and drinking waters based on the evaluation of the xenobiotic-induced impairment resulting in the activation and silencing of specific genes. Individuals of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parr were exposed during 5 days to environmentally relevant concentrations of three representative pharmaceutical compounds with high consumption rates: the analgesic acetaminophen (54.77+/-34.67 microg L(-1)), the anticonvulsant carbamazepine (7.85+/-0.13 microg L(-1)), and the beta-blocker atenolol (11.08+/-7.98 microg L(-1)). Five immature males were selected for transcriptome analysis in brain tissues by means of a 17k salmon cDNA microarray. For this purpose, mRNA was isolated and reverse-transcribed into cDNA which was labeled with fluorescent dyes and hybridized against a common pool to the arrays. Lists of significantly up- and down-regulated candidate genes were submitted to KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) in order to analyze for induced pathways and to evaluate the usefulness of this method in cases of not completely annotated test organisms. Exposure during 5 days to environmentally relevant concentrations of the selected pharmaceutical compounds acetaminophen, carbamazepine, and atenolol produced differences in the expression of 659, 700, and 480 candidate genes, respectively. KEGG annotation numbers (KO annotations) were obtained for between 26.57% and 33.33% of these differently expressed genes per treatment in comparison to non-exposure conditions. Pathways that showed to be induced did not always follow previously reported targets or metabolic routes for the employed treatments; however, several other pathways have been found (four or more features) to be significantly induced. Energy-related pathways have been altered under exposure in all the selected treatments, indicating a possible energy budget leakage due to additional processes resulting from the exposure to environmental contaminants. Observed induction of pathways may indicate additional processes involved in the mode of action of the selected pharmaceuticals which may not have been detected with conventional methods like quantitative PCR in which only suspected features are analyzed punctually for effects. The employment of novel high-throughput screening techniques in combination with global pathway analysis methods, even if the organism is not completely annotated, allows the examination of a much broader range of candidates for potential effects of exposure at the gene level. The continuously growing number of annotations of representative species relevant for environmental quality testing is facilitating pathway analysis processes for not completely annotated organisms. KEGG has shown to be a useful tool for the analysis of induced pathways from data generated by microarray techniques with the selected pharmaceutical contaminants acetaminophen, carbamazepine, and atenolol, but further studies have to be carried out in order to determine if a similar expression pattern in terms of fold change quantity and pathways is observed after long-term exposure. Together with the information obtained in this study, it will then be possible to evaluate the potential risk that the continuous release of these compounds may have on the environment and ecosystem functioning."
