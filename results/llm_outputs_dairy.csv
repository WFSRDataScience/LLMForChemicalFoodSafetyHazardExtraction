The evidence indicates that the risk of contracting new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease through the consumption of milk is negligible."

To avoid the problems associated with these viruses, quick and sensitive detection methods are necessary. In the present study, a fast real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the direct detection and quantification of L. delbrueckii phages in milk was developed. A set of primers and a TaqMan MGB probe was designed, based on the lysin gene sequence of different L. delbrueckii phages.

As ruminants are healthy carriers of STEC and most dairy products may provide these bacteria with favourable conditions for their growth, milk and dairy products are a potential source of STEC. But not all STEC serotypes are pathogens; only relatively small numbers in the entire family of STEC are pathogenic. This review focuses on the recent advances in understanding of STEC and their significance in milk and dairy products. It is intended to gather the information that is needed to understand how these bacteria are described, detected and characterised, how they contaminate milk and grow in dairy products, and how the dairy industry can prevent them from affecting the consumer."

Adulteration and contamination of milk were rampant before the passage and enforcement of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, and the introduction and eventual acceptance of certified and pasteurized milk have provided consumers with a consistently safe product. Homogenization and advances in the packaging and transport of milk gradually took hold, improving the milk supply. Other developments included the concentration of milk and whey, lactose-reduced milk, and the popularization of yogurt. Consumers have benefited from advances in butter packaging, low-fat ice cream, cheese manufacture, and yogurt technology, which has helped create the large demand for dairy products in the United States. Current trends and issues, including the increasing popularity of organic and artisanal products and the use of rBST, will shape the future of the dairy industry."

Parameter values of the model were estimated by fitting to experimental data of a cow feeding trial. Model calculations showed that almost all PFOS ingested is excreted through the cows' milk. The elimination rate, however, was low as the estimated half-life in the cow was 56days and it may, thus, take a long time after an initial pollution event to produce PFOS-free milk. The derived model can be used to estimate the transfer of PFOS through the dairy food chain and can be used for comparison of various contamination routes."

The maximum level of aflatoxin M1 in a single sample from an individual farm was 257 ng kg⁻¹ fresh milk. RESULTS: Aflatoxin analyses of commercial compound feed revealed that the contamination originated from the ingredient rice feed meal, a by-product from the preparation of Basmati rice for human consumption. Up to 56 μg kg⁻¹ of aflatoxin B1 was found in rice feed meal at one feed mill. CONCLUSION: The present example shows that an aflatoxin-contaminated minor feed ingredient included at less than 10% (w/w) of compound cattle feed can significantly contaminate the milk produced.

Its enterotoxins are thermostable, which increases the risk of potential contamination in a variety of food products. Here we investigated the influence of seasonality and food type on bacterial count and presence of S. aureus enterotoxins. To do this, we analyzed 3604 food samples collected over a 5-year period (2016-2020). Ordinal logistic regression showed an influence of both seasonality and food type on the bacterial count. Regarding bacterial counts, winter was found to be the season with the highest risk, while with regards to enterotoxin production, the highest risk was found in autumn, specifically in October. The risk of contamination with S. aureus was greatest for dairy products. Our findings may inform food epidemiologists about foodborne illness prevention and risk to human health."

In addition, higher priced milk, coming from minor dairy species, is often illegally integrated with the lower priced cow milk. The presence of species-specific proteins, different from those declared in label, may be a serious problem for people with allergies. The development of proper analytical methods is therefore essential to protect consumer benefits and product authenticity. In this study, a proteomic approach for the detection of adulteration processes of specific milks in mixtures is proposed. Few microliters of milk samples have been digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin and analyzed by nanoLC-ESI-IT-MS/MS. A post-database processing was performed to obtain confident peptide sequence assignments, allowing the detection of milk adulteration at a level lower than 1%.

We performed linear programming models to design nutritionally adequate diets constrained by food preferences for different constraints on pesticide intake at the least cost increment. Nutritional adequacy led to an increase in pesticide intakes without exceeding their ADI. Modifications in diets varied according to the model, but, in general, consisted in an increase in fruits and vegetables, dairy, and seafood, and a reduction in rice, red meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages quantities. In conclusion, meeting nutritional adequacy increases pesticide intake compared to the observed diets, without representing a health concern to consumers."

Case-control data suggest that galactose consumption through the ingestion of high-lactose dairy foods may be a dietary risk factor and that galactose metabolism, as measured by galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase, may be a genetic risk factor for early menopause and ovarian cancer. Supporting evidence includes animal studies, case reports, and ecologic studies. Avoidance of a high-galactose diet may decrease the risk for early menopause and ovarian cancer.

Microbial counts of Enterobacteriaceae, coliform organisms and Pseudomonas spp. were lower in salami made with the addition of starter cultures. Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp, and Listeria monocytogenes after the first week of ripening were only detected from control salami. Control salami were paler and harder, whereas those made with the addition of starter cultures were slightly saltier, juicier and in general more acceptable.

This paper analyses public acceptance and consumer's behaviour for various countermeasures for contaminated milk as revealed by a recent public survey in Belgium. The survey instrument used was Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing. A simulated news bulletin was included for a fast and realistic briefing on the situation investigated. The results show that clean feeding of dairy cattle and disposal of contaminated milk are the preferred options in case of contaminations above legal norms. For contaminations below legal norms, normal consumption of milk seems better accepted than disposal. Nonetheless, the expressed consumer's behaviour reveals a precautionary tendency: the presence of radioactivity at some step in the food chain could lead to avoiding purchasing products from affected areas. Finally, public trust building is revealed as a key element of a successful countermeasure strategy."

Because Victorian epidemiologists first recognized the milk-borne route in outbreaks of typhoid fever, these investigations served as a model for later studies of milk-borne scarlet fever, diphtheria, and perhaps tuberculosis. By focusing on epidemiological practices conducted by Medical Inspectors at the Medical Department of the Local Government Board and Medical Officers of Health, I show that Victorian epidemiology was committed to field-based, observational methods that defined the professional nature of the discipline and its theories and practices. Epidemiological investigations of milk-borne typhoid heated up several important public health debates in the second half of the nineteenth century, and demonstrate how Victorian epidemiology was not solely wedded to examining population studies using statistical methods, as historians have typically argued, but also relied on observational case-tracing in individuals, animals, and even environments."

Although there is no specific legislation regarding BA content in many fermented products, it is generally assumed that they should not be allowed to accumulate. The ability of microorganisms to decarboxylate amino acids is highly variable, often being strain specific, and therefore the detection of bacteria possessing amino acid decarboxylase activity is important to estimate the likelihood that foods contain BA and to prevent their accumulation in food products.

The case group consisted of herds from which homebred cattle with cysticercosis had been detected at the abattoir; the control group was composed of herds where no cases had been detected. Case herds were distributed over the study area. A logistic regression analysis revealed that the location (province), the number of slaughtered cattle, the flooding of pastures, free access of cattle to surface water and the proximity of wastewater effluent were significant explanatory variables for bovine cysticercosis to be recorded in a herd."

During baseflow conditions, hyporheic exchange flow causes particles to accumulate in streambed sediments. Remobilization of stored particles from streambed sediments occurs slowly during baseflow via hyporheic exchange flow, while remobilization is vastly increased during stormflow. Model predictions are compared to observations over a range of artificial and natural flood events in the dairy contaminated Topehaehae Stream, New Zealand.

The problem next became a public issue as public and private institutions grappled with questions of illness, safety, and disposal. To gain influence over those institutions, dissatisfied individuals and groups then turned the PBB contamination into a political controversy. The final section of the present article analyzes how science and politics interacted in: the ways bureaucratic organizations defined the three problems of contamination; the role political controversy played in redefining problems and influencing policy; and the political roles of scientists in controversies over environmental contamination."

RESULTS: 132 concentrate and 85 milk samples were collected during five farm visits and analysed for aflatoxins. Aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁) was > 0.1 μg kg⁻¹ in two-thirds of the feeds and > 5 μg kg⁻¹ in nine. Contamination was higher in maize than in other pure feeds (median: 0.8 versus 0.1 μg kg⁻¹); complementary feeds showed intermediate values. Aflatoxin M₁ (AFM₁) was > 3 ng kg⁻¹ in one-third of milks and > 25 ng kg⁻¹ in three. All the milk samples were below EU statutory limits. The farm ranks for milk AFM₁ level and the peak of concentrate AFB₁ contamination were significantly correlated (0.642).

Antibiotic residues constitute a risk to human health, since they can cause allergic reactions in hypersensitive individuals or they may lead to the appearance of drug-resistant bacteria. Analysis of these residues plays a key role in ensuring food safety. Regulatory agencies in the European Union and in other countries have established maximum residue limits and requirements concerning the performance of analytical methods and the interpretation of the results. This review describes the state of the art in the analytical strategies concerning the multi-class as well as the multi-residue analysis of antibiotics in milk. Since milk is a complex matrix due to its high protein and fat content, which often interfere in analytical procedures, special focus has been placed on sample preparation: extraction and clean-up. Confirmation of antibiotic residues according to European Decision 657/2002/EC has been also discussed."

The physical environment was linked via a marine and an agricultural food chain model to a human bioaccumulation model. Contaminant uptake via the primary dietary sources of persistent lipophilic contaminants in industrialized countries was addressed, namely fish, dairy products, and beef. In addition, uptake from air and water was considered, allowing the model also to treat less lipophilic compounds. To evaluate the model, the food chain characteristics were parameterized for southern Sweden and historical scenarios of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in air, water, and soil in this region were constructed from published data. The resulting model predictions of PCB concentrations in fish, milk, beef, and human tissue agreed well with measured concentrations from Swedish monitoring programs. This suggests that ACC-HUMAN is a useful tool for predicting human exposure to bioaccumulative organic compounds. It can be linked easily to existing multimedia fate and transport models."

GdmH-related proteins, as important functional units widely present in Staphylococcus species, have not been reported in S. aureus so far. In this study, we identified a gdmH-related gene, named ghl. We found that mutation of ghl gene could decrease the tolerance of environmental stresses (heat, desiccation, salt and hydrogen peroxide) of S. aureus and enhanced the capacities of biofilm formation. In addition, the ghl mutant was more sensitive to vancomycin on CAMHB solid plates but more resistant to vancomycin in CAMHB liquid medium compared to wild type RMSA24. These results indicated that ghl is an important factor to respond to environmental stress in foodborne S. aureus. This paper for the first time reported that a GdmH-related protein plays an important role in environmental tolerance, providing a new direction for the follow-up study of GdmH-related proteins, as well as a potential target gene for further research on the tolerance mechanism of Staphylococcus aureus in food processing and the control of biofilm formation."

Ten isolates (71%) exhibited AMR to at least one of the tested antimicrobials, four (40%) were multidrug-resistant, and one isolate produced extended-spectrum β-lactamases. The obtained results indicate that SCM acts as a source for the spread of potentially pathogenic E. coli strains that are resistant to many groups of antimicrobials, and may constitute a hazard to both public and animal health."

In spring 2020, a foodborne outbreak of S. Enteritidis occurred in the Marche region (Central Italy), involving 85 people. The common exposure source was a cheese, pecorino ""primo sale"", produced with raw sheep milk. The cheese batches were produced by two local dairies, with a livestock production facility, also including a sheep farm, being part of one dairy. Bacteriological analysis of samples collected allowed the detection of S. Enteritidis in animal faeces, environmental samples, raw-milk bulk tanks and milk taken from single animals. These data confirm that, despite the scarce scientific evidence, S. Enteritidis can infect sheep and be shed into the animals' milk. Hence, this is a real risk for public health when unpasteurized milk is used in production of such cheese.

The purpose of this article is to estimate human exposure to perchlorate from ingestion of drinking water, human milk, and dairy milk. Drinking-water exposure was based on a range of possible regulatory values, derived from the recently established reference dose. Exposure to perchlorate from the consumption of milk was based on exploratory Food and Drug Administration dairy milk data, and on additional published perchlorate concentrations in dairy and human milk samples.

The traditional taxonomic procedures for classification of staphylococcal species are time consuming and often several tests are required. FTIR spectroscopy offers a rapid method for the discrimination and identification of S. aureus strains isolated from raw milk and raw milk cheeses. FTIR spectroscopy was used to discriminate S. aureus from other species of Staphylococcus. This was achieved by using a model composed of 39 species and subspecies of Staphylococcus. The model was validated using a set of spectra of strains isolated from raw milk and different varieties of French raw milk cheese. S. aureus was successfully discriminated from the other species of Staphylococcus and all the strains of S. aureus isolated from raw milk and different varieties of French raw milk cheese were also successfully identified as such. These results demonstrated that FTIR spectroscopy is a rapid (results obtained within 24 h starting from a pure strain or a single colony) and robust method for the identification of S. aureus isolates of dairy origin and food-borne origin in general.

However, a few species are known toxin producers, including the foodborne pathogen, B. cereus. This species produces two distinct types of foodborne illness, the emetic (vomit-inducing) syndrome, associated with consumption of toxin in cooked rice dishes, and the diarrheal illness seen occasionally following consumption of contaminated meats, sauces, and certain dairy products. In the latter case, illness results from the production of enterotoxins by vegetative cells in the small intestine of the host. In dairy products, the occurrence of Bacillus spp. is inevitable, and the spore-forming ability of this organism allows it to easily survive pasteurization. Many strains have been shown to grow and produce enterotoxin in dairy products at refrigeration temperatures. Evaluation of toxin gene presence and toxin expression in Bacillus spp. other than B. cereus has not been thoroughly investigated. However, the presence of natural isolates of Bacillus spp. harboring one or more enterotoxin gene(s) and subsequent demonstration of conditions which may support toxin expression holds crucial importance in the food safety arena."

The estimated daily prevalence of contaminated beef-carcass quarters as the output of the model was 9.2%. Contaminated was defined as containing one or more CFU on the surface of a carcass quarter at the end of the quartering stage. Single interventions (except irradiation) could reduce the prevalence to from 6.2% to 1.7%, whereas the combination of interventions could lower it to from 1.2% to 0.1%. The most powerful intervention was irradiation, which could reduce the prevalence to <0.1%.

Currently, no analytical method allows detection of the addition of bovine whey to water buffalo ricotta, so this fraudulent practice cannot be prevented. The authors' aim was to develop such a method. The conditions for extraction and purification of denatured ricotta whey proteins, which are unfolded and coagulated by heating during the production process, were optimized. The optimal composition of the polyacrylamide gel (pH range, type and concentration of chemical separator) was first evaluated and then the best conditions to perform the separation by isoelectric focusing were established. The performance of the method (precision, selectivity, robustness, sensibility) was determined. The method was shown to be reliable and robust for detection of the presence of bovine whey added to water buffalo Ricotta at percentages above 5% (v/v). The results suggest that the differences observed between bovine and water buffalo electrophoretic profiles are due to bovine β-lactoglobulin isoform A, which is never detected in water buffalo samples."

The SPEL (sensing pathogens electrically in liquids) biosensor consists of a 3D printed vial and uses an RF reader and an RFID (radio-frequency identification) compatible Split Ring Resonator (SRR) based tag. The SPEL biosensor is capable of detecting bacteria at 5 log CFU/mL within 75 min, with the possibility of testing multiple concurrent samples. Detection is based on impedance loading of SRR by d-AuNP bound to pathogenic bacteria. Spectrophotometry, along with carbohydrate-functionalized magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) cell capture, is used to verify the sensitivity of the SPEL biosensor with respect to d-AuNP presence. The proof-of-concept device, along with challenges and opportunities for commercialization, are also outlined."

Results from the univariate analysis indicated that using automatic take offs and having an open herd management increased the risk of BTM contamination with L. monocytogenes, while storing manure in outside pens not accessible to cattle decreased the risk. These variables, however, were not sustained in the multivariable model, which indicated that the presence of L. monocytogenes in BTM was significantly associated with region of the country (farms in the southeast and northeast were six and four times more likely respectively, to have BTM contamination than farms in the west) and number of milking cows (herds with >500 milking cows were five times more likely to have BTM contamination than herds with <100 milking cows).

We simulated the contamination of a real high-risk cheese with a natural food isolate of Staphylococcus aureus, an enterotoxin-producing pathogen responsible for food poisoning. To overcome the problem of a detection limit in a solid matrix, we chose to work with a fluorescent reporter (superfolder green fluorescent protein) that would allow spatiotemporal monitoring of S. aureus populations and targeted gene expression. The combination of complementary techniques revealed that S. aureus localizes preferentially on the cheese surface during ripening.

During cheese ripening, the storage areas and the direct contact of the cheese with the wood must be carefully managed because the proliferation of contaminating microorganisms, parasites, and insects increases significantly and product quality quickly declines, notably from a sensory level. The use of ozone (as gas or as ozonated water) can be effective for sanitizing air, water, and surfaces in contact with food, and its use can also be extended to the treatment of waste and process water. Ozone is easily generated and is eco-sustainable as it tends to disappear in a short time, leaving no residues of ozone.

This study characterized the microbiological contamination by coliforms, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, in 99 MFC samples obtained in retail sale and produced by three distinct industrial procedures. Dairy processors were selected to investigate the key points of E. coli and S. aureus contamination during cheese processing. MFC samples produced by the addition of lactic culture presented higher counts of coliforms and E. coli, when compared to other samples (p<0.05). MFC samples produced by the addition of rennet alone presented higher counts of S. aureus when compared to other samples (p<0.05). Fourteen of 19 MFC samples produced by the addition of lactic culture presented E. coli counts higher than 5 × 10(2) colon-forming units/g. The processing steps after pasteurization were identified as the main sources of E. coli and S. aureus contamination of MFC. Based on the results, MFC was characterized as a potential hazard for consumers due to the high frequency of samples contaminated with E. coli and S. aureus counts in noncompliance with Brazilian standards for sanitary quality and safety."

A number of studies have shown that, as for other persistent organic pollutants, dietary intake is one of the main routes of human exposure to PBDEs. The most recent scientific literature concerning the levels of PBDEs in foodstuffs and the human dietary exposure to these BFRs are here reviewed. It has been noted that the available information on human total daily intake through food consumption is basically limited to a number of European countries, USA, China, and Japan. In spite of the considerable methodological differences among studies, the results show notable coincidences such as the important contribution to the sum of total PBDEs of some congeners such as BDEs 47, 49, 99 and 209, the comparatively high contribution of fish and seafood, and dairy products, and the probably limited human health risks derived from dietary exposure to PBDEs.

This current review introduces the principles of Raman spectroscopy and presents recent advances since 2012 of Raman spectroscopic techniques mainly involving surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), fourier-transform (FT) Raman spectroscopy, near-infrared (NIR) Raman spectroscopy, and micro-Raman spectroscopy for milk analysis including milk compositions, microorganisms and antibiotic residues in milk, as well as milk adulterants. Additionally, some challenges and future outlooks are proposed.

The entry, establishment, and persistence of food-borne pathogens in dairy processing environments also present a considerable risk to products postprocessing. Food safety management systems coupled with regulatory policies and microbiological standards for milk and milk products currently implemented in various nations work to reduce risk while improving the quality and safety of cheese and other dairy products. With that, cheese has enjoyed an excellent food safety record with relatively few outbreaks of food-borne disease considering the amount of cheese produced and consumed worldwide.

Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken to assess aflatoxin contamination levels of milk in Kasarani sub-county. A total of 84 milk samples were collected from small-holder dairy farms and analyzed for AFM1 using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Results and Discussion: Ninety nine percent of the samples (83/84) analysed were contaminated with AFM1. The mean aflatoxin level was 84 ng/kg with 64% of the samples exceeding the EU legal limit of 50 ng/kg. Whereas 80% of the farmers were aware of aflatoxin, there was no correlation between farmers' knowledge and gender with AFM1 prevalence.

Most of the MRSA isolates (27 of 51) belonged to spa-type t127 (43.1%), followed by t2678 (3.9%), t044 (2%), t1166 (2%), and t1773 (2%). PFGE performed on mecA positive strains identified one cluster (≥ 80% of similarity), comprising 22 MRSA. Nine of twenty-two MRSA isolates were assigned human host origin, and 13 isolates did not belong to a specific host. During the characterization study, one strain isolated from bulk tank milk samples harbored the pvl gene; the strain was not enterotoxigenic with a non-specific host according to the biotyping scheme, highlighting the possible emerging risk of transmission of bacterial virulence factors by foods, the environment, and foodhandlers. These findings stress the importance of hygienic measures at all processing steps of the food production chain and underline that monitoring for the presence of MRSA throughout the food chain is essential for public health."

Four modules were constructed to simulate pathogen growth and staphylococcal enterotoxin A production scenarios to quantify consumer risk levels under various time and temperature storage conditions. The three growth modules predicted that S. aureus levels could surpass the 10(5) CFU/ml level of concern at the 99.9th or 99.99th percentile of servings and therefore may represent a potential consumer risk. Results obtained from the staphylococcal enterotoxin A production module predicted that exposure at the 99.99th percentile could represent a dose capable of eliciting staphylococcal enterotoxin intoxication in all consumer age groups.

Data on the pharmacokinetics of chlorophacinone in milk of accidently exposed ewes were used to estimate the risk associated with its consumption. Three days after accidental ingestion, chlorophacinone was detected in plasma of 18 ewes, with concentrations exceeding 100 ng/mL in 11 animals. Chlorophacinone was detected in milk on day 2 post-exposure and remained quantifiable for at least 7 days in milk of these 11 ewes. Concentrations in milk were much lower than in plasma and decreased quickly (mean half-life of 2 days). This study demonstrated dose-dependent mammary transfer of ingested chlorophacinone. Variation in prothrombin time (PT) on Day 3 suggested that some of the ewes that ingested chlorophacinone may have been adversely affected, but PT did not facilitate estimation of the quantity of chlorophacinone consumed.

Phage infection can lead to slow lactic acid production or even the total failure of fermentation. The associated economic losses can be substantial. Rapid and sensitive methods are therefore required to detect and identify phages at all stages of the manufacture of fermented dairy products. This study describes a simple and rapid multiplex PCR method that, in a single reaction, detects the presence of bacteriophages infecting Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, plus three genetically distinct 'species' of Lactococcus lactis phages commonly found in dairy plants (P335, 936 and c2). Available bacteriophage genome sequences were examined and the conserved regions used to design five pairs of primers, one for each of the above bacteriophage species. These primers were designed to generate specific fragments of different size depending on the species. Since this method can detect the above phages in untreated milk and can be easily incorporated into dairy industry routines, it might be readily used to earmark contaminated milk for use in processes that do not involve susceptible starter organisms or for use in those that involve phage-deactivating conditions."

This effect was also observed when analysing nutritional status of crayfish fed toxic and non-toxic cyanobacteria with the former having better lipid and protein contents than those fed non-toxic Microcystis. P. clarkii accumulated up to 2.9 microg MCYST/dry crayfish weight and the depuration pattern was similar to that observed for mussels by other authors. Due to the fact that the major part of the toxin is accumulated in the intestine and in the hepatopancreas, there is no significant risk in terms of human health if these parts are removed prior to crayfish consumption. Nevertheless, their use in dairy food and the possible transference of toxins along food chains should not be disregarded."

Analysis of yoghurts showed that all the samples were contaminated with AFM(1) in concentration levels ranging from 4.2 to 78.9 ng/kg. In general, 16 samples (13.33%) had higher AFM(1) level than the maximum tolerance limit (50 ng/kg) accepted by European Union, but the contamination level was lower than 500 ng/kg in all the samples, which is accepted by Codex Alimentarius and National Standard. The concentration of AFM(1) in 26 samples (21.66) was lower than 10 ng/kg. The range of contamination of AFM(1) was comparatively higher in traditional yoghurt (average concentration of 32.9 ng/kg) than that in commercial yoghurt (average concentration of 21.6 ng/kg; p < 0.01). Because yoghurt is the most popular dairy product consumed in Iran, the AFM(1) contamination is a serious problem for public health.

Results from this study highlighted the biofilm-forming potential of both spores and vegetative cells of two different Bacillus species. It was shown that once Bacillus spores had attached to a surface, the spores germinated under favorable (B. cereus DL5) and even unfavorable (B. subtilis 168) nutrient conditions, resulting in biofilms containing both spores and vegetative populations. Furthermore, it was suggested that vegetative B. cereus DL5 cells exhibited a low propensity for spore formation in attached and planktonic growth forms in nutrient-limited growth medium. By contrast, vegetative B. subtilis 168 cells readily formed spores in planktonic and attached microcosms when exposed to nutrient-limited growth conditions. Sporulation in attached Bacillus populations is an important practical consideration for many food industries, such as dairy processing, where bacilli are routinely isolated from populations attached to processing-equipment surfaces."

The outcome of this study was that the ante mortem (AM) and post mortem (PM) inspections have a substantial overlap, and that with regard to food safety and public health in over 99% of cases the PM could even be omitted on the basis of the AM. In this study, the data provided by the dairy farmers on the current FCI forms contributed little to nothing with regard to the outcomes of AM and PM inspection. It is concluded that current meat inspection procedures need an update and a more risk-based approach needs to be adopted. Regarding this, the AM inspection of dairy cattle should remain, because it plays an important role in ensuring food safety (e. g. , by preventing contamination of the slaughter line by excessively dirty animals, or animals with abscesses), monitoring animal welfare and in detecting some important notifiable diseases. The PM inspection, however, could in many cases be omitted, provided there is a strict AM inspection complemented by a vastly improved (automated) way of obtaining reliable FCI."

The risk assessment tool was tested by 25 field personnel working with northeastern milk receivers and 250 producers in seven states. The participants in the study identified a lack of adequate treatment records as being the highest risk factor for antibiotic residues, followed by deficiencies in understanding how to use antibiotics and poor relationships between veterinarians and their clients. When field representatives utilized the risk assessment tool, for most producers, risk of antibiotic residue decreased by approximately 19%.

Over 300 farms were involved, affecting about 15,500 animals (mostly dairy cattle). For a period of one to four weeks these animals took up a thousand kg of lead. This resulted in lead levels in milk, livers, and kidneys above the regulatory safety limits. Due to the chelating therapy, which was rapidly applied by the local veterinarians, only about 30 animals died of an acute lead intoxication. A joint action of the governmental and private authorities prevented exposure of consumers to lead-contaminated animal products. Based on observations, measurements and literature data, predictions were made of the lead levels to be expected in animal products and the time needed for depletion of these levels. The appropriate animals were ear-tagged to ensure their identification, and the decline in time of the lead levels in milk and offals was conscientiously monitored. In the second week of 1990 the lead concentrations were decreased to levels well below the regulatory limits, and hence the tags were removed.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Faecal samples from beef cattle were collected at slaughterhouses. The isolates were submitted to colony hybridization assay with specific DNA probes for stx1, stx2 and eae genes, and serotyped for the identification of O and H antigens. Thirty-nine per cent of beef cattle surveyed harboured at least one STEC strain. Among the distinct serotypes identified, 10 were shared by both beef and dairy cattle. Most of the strains isolated harboured stx2. Genotypic and phenotypic profiles allowed the identification of 34 and 31 STEC strains, isolated from beef and dairy cattle, respectively. Serotypes O10:H14, O15:H21, O96:H21, O119:H4, O124:H11, O128:H21, O137:H-, O141:H19, O159:H42, O160:H2 and O177:H11, identified in this study, have not been previously reported as STEC isolated from cattle. CONCLUSIONS: Cattle are an important reservoir of STEC strains associated with human diseases in South America. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Determining the prevalence, genotypic profile and serotypes of STEC strains isolated from cattle enables the prediction of possible risk for public health."

The purpose of this study was to explore the geographic relationships among dairy farms, nitrate levels in drinking water, low birth weight, and socioeconomic data at the ZIP code level in the San Joaquin Valley. This ecological study used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to explore and analyze secondary data. A total of 211 ZIP codes were analyzed using spatial autocorrelation and regression analysis methods in ArcGIS version 10.1. ZIP codes with dairies had a higher percentage of Hispanic births (p =.001). Spatial statistics revealed that ZIP codes with more dairy farms and a higher dairy cow density had higher levels of nitrate contamination. No correlation was detected between LBW and unsafe nitrate levels at the ZIP code level. Further research examining communities that use private and small community wells in the San Joaquin Valley should be conducted. Birth data from smaller geographic areas should be used to continue exploring the relationship between birth outcomes and nitrate contamination in drinking water."

The B. cereus population did not grow and remained mainly unaltered during storage of milk at 4 °C while storage at a suboptimal temperature at 8 °C (representative of a broken cold chain) caused a major shift in its composition. Mesophilic strains dominated the B. cereus population in raw milk and after storage at 4 °C, while psycrotrophic strains dominated after storage at 8 °C. All psycrotrophic and mesophilic isolates (n = 368) demonstrated high spoilage potentials of the milk components. Fifteen out of 20 mesophilic isolates but only two out of 40 psychrotrophic isolates, exhibited vero cell toxicity. No genes encoding the emetic toxin cereulide were detected in the genomes of 100 milk isolates while 14 of them harbored the enterotoxin genes cytK1/cytK2. Both psycrotrophic and mesophilic isolates carried the enterotoxin genes nheA and hblA. Together, the results provide insight into the composition and properties, of the B. cereus population present in milk along the value chain and during storage at optimal refrigerated temperature and at suboptimal temperature. This knowledge is useful in the dairy industry's work to assure high quality products and for risk assessment."

Households randomly selected from urban areas (n = 135) and non‐urban areas (n = 135) were surveyed using semi‐structured questionnaires. An ordinal logistic regression was used to estimate probability of households preferring to consume particular milk products and that of milk safety knowledge being important to households. Urban households were 2.8 times more likely to consume fresh milk (p <.05). Households from urban areas were two times more likely to purchase fresh milk from the kiosks, while households from non‐urban areas were five times more likely to buy fresh milk from vendors. The likelihood of appearance, quality and nutritional value of milk products being important to households was higher in urban locations compared to non‐urban locations. Consumers prioritized price and convenience over milk safety. Knowledge and awareness of milk safety issues was more important to urban households. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Understanding consumption preferences and consumer perceptions enables regulatory agencies, policy‐makers, and the dairy industry to make informed decisions and to put in place awareness programs on the risks of purchasing potentially contaminated milk through informal markets."

The plethora of diverse toxins and drug resistance are the focus for B. cereus. As an alternative treatment to antibiotics, probiotics can effectively alleviate the hazards of super bacteria, food safety, and antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to investigate the frequency and distribution of B. cereus in dairy cows and to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus in a model of endometritis induced by multi-drug-resistant B. cereus. A strong poisonous strain with a variety of drug resistances was used to establish an endometrial epithelial cell infection model. B. cereus was shown to cause damage to the internal structure, impair the integrity of cells, and activate the inflammatory response, while L. rhamnosus could inhibit cell apoptosis and alleviate this damage. This study indicates that the B. cereus-induced activation of the NLRP3 signal pathway involves K+ efflux. We conclude that LGR-1 may relieve cell destruction by reducing K+ efflux to the extracellular caused by the perforation of the toxins secreted by B. cereus on the cell membrane surface."

Various parameters that affected the capture efficiency (CE) of IMS, including the number of antibodies, IMBs dose, incubation time, magnetic separation time, and immunoreaction temperature, were systematically investigated. We further determined the optimal enrichment conditions for different dairy substrates to ensure maximum enrichment of target pathogens in the system. An IMS technique combining improved propidium monoazide (PMAxx) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was established to detect the pathogenic VBNC C. sakazakii. The IMS-PMAxx-ddPCR method after IMBs enrichment showed higher accuracy when the VBNC C. sakazakii was under 1 Log10 copies/g. The detection limit for this method in a background of powdered infant formula (PIF) was 5.6 copies/g.

In this study, a comparison of a specially adapted coating method, impedance method, direct inoculation and membrane filter technique was carried out to determine contamination with yeasts, moulds, coliforms and total bacterial counts using the appropriate agar in each case. The coating method is recommended for determining yeasts, moulds and coliforms as it allows the localization of the microorganisms as well as the determination of single microorganisms. For total bacterial count, a direct inoculation technique is proposed. The employing of simple measures in the production and during transport of packaging materials, such as dust-prevention or tight sealing in polyethylene bags, heavily reduces microbial contamination rates of packaging material. To reduce contamination rates further, electron beam irradiation was applied: plastic cups sealed in polyethylene bags were treated with 4-5 kGy, a dose that already leads to sterile polystyrene and polypropylene cups without influencing mechanical characteristics of the packaging material."

Furthermore, it is a raw material for many dairy products, such as yoghurt, cheese, cream etc. Before reaching consumers, milk goes through production, processing and circulation. Each step involves potentially unsafe factors, such as chemical contamination that can affect milk quality. Antibiotics are widely used in veterinary medicine for dry cow therapy and mastitis treatment in lactating cows, which can cause the presence of antimicrobial residues in milk. In order to ensure consumers' safety, milk is analyzed to make sure that the fixed Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for antibiotics are not exceeded. Multiclass methods can monitor more drug classes through a single analysis, so they are faster, less time-consuming and cheaper than traditional methods (single-class); this aspect is particularly important for milk, which is a highly perishable food. Nevertheless, multiclass methods for veterinary drug residues in foodstuffs are real analytical challenges.

Whereas, biotransfer factors and partition factors are inputs that, to a large extent, involve uncertainty. Using ingestion of fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy products, and meat and soils assumed to be contaminated by hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) as cases studies, a Monte Carlo analysis is used to explore the relative contribution of uncertainty and variability to overall variance in the estimated distribution of potential dose within the population that consumes home-grown foods.

The consumption of PC-rich foods by cattle can affect ruminant health and the yield and quality of milk. Indigenous PCs in milk are not thought to pose a health risk to humans and may in fact have some salutary effects. The specific PC profile of milks from different ruminant species appear to play a significant role in the distinct sensory traits of these milks and the products therefrom.

Samples from bulk tank milk, milk filters, feces, feed, teats and teat milk were collected from eleven farms with loose housing and seven with tie-stall housing every second month over a period of 11 months and analyzed for the presence of Campylobacter spp. , L. monocytogenes and STEC. Campylobacter spp. , L. monocytogenes and STEC were abundant in samples from the farm environment and were also detected in 4%, 13% and 7% of the milk filters, respectively, and in 3%, 0% and 1% of bulk tank milk samples. Four STEC isolates carried the eae gene, which is linked to the capacity to cause more severe human disease. The results indicate a higher prevalence of L. monocytogenes and Campylobacter spp. in samples collected from loose housed herds compared to tie-stalled herds suggesting that the operating system can influence the food safety of raw milk. Significance and Impact of the study: This study highlights that zoonotic bacteria can be present in raw milk independent of hygienic conditions at the farm and what hosing system is used. Altogether, this study provides an important knowledge base for evaluating the risk of drinking unpasteurized milk."

In this work, the effect of increased dairy solids levels on the thermal resistance of Listeria monocytogenes was examined through the use of ultrafiltered (UF) milk, reconstituted milk powder, and the milk components lactose and caseinate. From the results obtained, lactose and caseinate did not appear to affect thermal resistance. In addition, the level of milk fat, up to 10% of the total solids in UF whole milk, did not result in statistically significant changes to thermal resistance when compared with UF skim milk. Reconstituted skim milk powder at 27% total solids (D⁶²-value = 1.16 ± 0.2 [SD] min, z = 5.7) did result in increased thermal resistance, as compared with reconstituted skim milk powder at 17.5% (D⁶²-value = 0.86 ± 0.02 min, z = 5.57) and UF whole milk at 27% total solids (D⁶²-value = 0.66 ± 0.07 min, z = 5.16). However, that increase appeared to be due to the increase in salt levels, not to increases in caseinate, fat, or lactose.

In Brazil, despite very few reported cases of listeriosis, the pathogen has been repeatedly isolated from dairies. This has led the government to implement specific legislation to reduce the hazard. Here, we determined the incidence of L. monocytogenes in five dairies and retail products in the Southeast and Midwest regions of Brazil over eight months. Of 437 samples, three samples (0.7%) from retail and only one sample (0.2%) from the dairies were positive for L. monocytogenes. Thus, the contamination rate was significantly reduced as compared to previous studies. MultiLocus Sequence Typing (MLST) was used to determine if contamination was caused by new or persistent clones leading to the first MLST profile of L. monocytogenes from the Brazilian dairy industry. The processing environment isolate is of concern being a sequence-type (ST) 2, belonging to the lineage I responsible for the majority of listeriosis outbreaks. Also, ST3 and ST8 found in commercialized cheese have previously been reported in outbreaks. Despite the lower incidence, dairy products still pose a potential health risk and the occurrence of L. monocytogenes in dairies and retail products emphasize the need for continuous surveillance of this pathogen in the Brazilian dairy industry."

MAP is suspected to be associated with several diseases in humans, therefore the risk of exposure should be better understood. The primary source of MAP for humans is thought to be cattle, in which MAP causes paratuberculosis or Johne's disease. We developed a stochastic quantitative risk assessment model using Monte Carlo simulations. Considering the assumptions and uncertainties, we estimated the overall risk of exposure to MAP via milk to be low. For people consuming raw milk from MAP positive farms, the risk was high. On-farm pasteurisation reduced the risk considerably, but not completely. The risk of exposure via pasteurised retail milk was most likely insignificant. However, with a higher paratuberculosis prevalence the risk would also increase. Given the popularity of raw milk vending machines and homemade dairy products, this risk should not be ignored. To reduce the risk, consumers should heat raw milk before consumption. To prevent a potential public health scare and safeguard farmers' livelihoods, a reduction in paratuberculosis prevalence should be sought.

The obtained results reveal that there is a high potential risk of developing nephrotoxicity through the dietary intake of Pb in the case of both genders. The dietary intake determined for other elements (Cd, Hg, and Ni) was far below the limits established by European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) supported analytical determinations and revealed that cereals and vegetables were major contributors to a total intake of Cd (39.6 and 17.4% of the total exposure, respectively), Ni (40.4 and 19.3%), and Hg (16.8 and 19.6%), while water and beverages were major dietary sources of Pb (31% of the total daily intake). In contrast, eggs, fats and oils, and milk and dairy products provided the smallest amounts of Cd, Pb, and Ni.

BA-producing microorganisms are not necessarily pathogenic, such as lactic acid bacteria, which are, on the contrary, among the most beneficial microbiota to human beings and some of which even have probiotic properties. However, the incidence of BAs in dairy products and their possible implication in serious dairy-borne intoxications has long been overlooked. Consequently, the implementation of control measures to limit such an incidence has not been considered among the priorities of the food safety authorities. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern with regard to the presence of BAs in dairy products, because their toxicological status as toxins that may have serious acute and/or chronic adverse health effects is becoming increasingly evident and well-documented. The main BAs associated with dairy products are reviewed herein from the perspective of their incidence in these food products, and to draw the attention of readers to the shortage in data to perform pertinent risk assessment, which is considered to be a key action to provide efficient control means and to help decision makers issue appropriate legislative and regulatory measures."

In order to maintain sufficient health status among the herd or promote growth and increase production, farmers administer preventative antibiotic doses to the animals through their feed. However, many antibiotics used in cattle farms are intended for the treatment of bacterial infections in humans. This results in the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria which pose a great risk for public health. Additionally, antibiotic residues are found in milk and dairy products, with potential toxic effects for the consumers. Hence the need of antibiotic residues monitoring in milk arises. Analytical methods were developed for the determination of antibiotics in milk, with key priority given to the analyte extraction and preconcentration step. Extraction can benefit from the production of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) that can be applied as sorbents for the extraction of specific antibiotics. This review focuses on the principals of molecular imprinting technology and synthesis methods of MIPs, as well as the application of MIPs and MIPs composites for the chromatographic determination of various antibiotic categories in milk found in the recent literature."

The effects of initial pH values, adsorbent dose, contact time and ionic strength of the adsorption performance of MOF 1 were investigated. The adsorption kinetics best fit the pseudo-second order model, and the adsorption isotherms matched the Langmuir adsorption model well. It was indicated that both chemical adsorption and physical adsorption play an important role in the adsorption process, and the adsorption of tetracycline was homogeneous and occurred on a monolayer on the surface of MOF 1. Additionally, the stability of MOF 1 and the details of the adsorption mechanism were also investigated.

The presence of harmful pesticide residues in food has caused a great concern among the consumers. Hence, world over to tackle food safety issues, organic farming is being propagated. However, due to several reasons, diffusion and acceptance of this approach in developing countries has been very slow. Therefore, it is important in the transient phase that some pragmatic solution should be developed to tackle this situation of food safety. Food processing treatments such as washing, peeling, canning or cooking lead to a significant reduction of pesticide residues. In this background this paper reviews the common food processing operations along with the degree of residue removal in each process. The processes reviewed include: baking, bread making, dairy product manufacture, drying, thermal processing, fermentation, freezing, infusion, juicing, malting, milling, parboiling, peeling, peeling and cooking, storage, storage and milling, washing, washing and cooking, washing and drying, washing and peeling, washing peeling and juicing and wine making.

We examined associations between reported consumption of specific foods and beverages and first trimester urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations in 656 pregnant women within a multicenter cohort study, The Infant Development and Environment Study (TIDES), using multivariate regression analysis. We also examined whether reported use of ecofriendly and chemical-free products was associated with lower phthalate biomarker levels in comparison to not following such practices. Consumption of one additional serving of dairy per week was associated with decreases of 1% in the sum of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolite levels (95% CI: -2.0, -0.2). Further, participants who reported sometimes eating homegrown food had monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP) levels that were 16.6% lower (95% CI: -29.5, -1.3) in comparison to participants in the rarely/never category. In contrast to rarely/never eating frozen fruits and vegetables, participants who reported sometimes following this practice had monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) levels that were 21% higher (95% CI: 3.3, 41.7) than rarely/ever respondents.

Antibiotics are considered to be the first choice in the treatment of the disease. However, the problem of antibiotic residue and antimicrobial resistance, in addition to the impact of antibiotic abuse on public health, leads to many restrictions on uncontrolled antibiotic therapy in the dairy sector worldwide. Researchers have investigated novel therapeutic approaches to replace the use of antibiotics in mastitis control. These efforts, supported by the revolutionary development of nanotechnology, stem cell assays, molecular biological tools, and genomics, enabled the development of new approaches for mastitis-treatment and control. The present review discusses recent concepts to control mastitis such as breeding of mastitis-resistant dairy cows, the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools, the application of communication technology as an educational and epidemiological tool, application of modern mastitis vaccines, cow drying protocols, teat disinfection, housing, and nutrition. These include the application of nanotechnology, stem cell technology, photodynamic and laser therapy or the use of traditional herbal medical plants, nutraceuticals, antibacterial peptides, bacteriocins, antibodies therapy, bacteriophages, phage lysins, and probiotics as alternatives to antibiotics."

Vitamin B12 content was determined in milk and several matrices related to the process of transformation of the residual whey from Parmigiano Reggiano cheese-making to obtain ricotta cheese. In addition, vitamin B12 degradation during ricotta cheese shelf-life was studied. The analyses were performed using an ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Results show that vitamin B12 amount in ricotta from dairy and experimental cheese-making brings respectively 1/8 to 1/4 of the adequate intake in adults established by EFSA. In addition, shelf-life experiment shows that cobalamine is fairly rapidly degraded in ricotta: light effect seems to be significant, even if the light exposure is short. The use of photoprotective packaging material increases B12 shelf-life in the early stage of storage."

Biosensors can be applied in this field; however, the influence of the milk matrix on their activity has been poorly studied in light of the preanalytical process. Herein, aptamer-conjugated gold nanoparticles (nanoaptasensors) were investigated for the colorimetric detection in raw milk of four antibiotics used in cattle. The effect of milk components on the colorimetric response of the nanoaptasensors was analyzed by following the selective aggregation of the nanoparticles, using the absorption ratio A520/A720. A preanalytical strategy was developed to apply the nanoaptasensors to antibiotic-contaminated raw milk samples, which involves a clarification step with Carrez reagents followed by the removal of cations through dilution, chelation (EDTA) or precipitation (NaHCO3). The colorimetric signals were detected in spiked samples at concentrations of antibiotics as low as 0.25-fold the maximum residue limits (MRLs) for kanamycin (37.5 μg/L), oxytetracycline (25 μg/L), sulfadimethoxine (6.25 μg/L) and ampicillin (1 μg/L), according to European and Chilean legislation. Overall, we conclude that this methodology holds potential for the semiquantitative analysis of antibiotic residues in raw milk obtained directly from dairy farms."

The effectiveness of the method was investigated by the analysis of 9017 milk samples collected in Italian milk processing plants that applied control plans with different action limits (AL). For those milk processing plants where 30 ng kg-1 AL has been applied, the AFM1 contamination was significantly lower at or above the 95th percentile of the milk samples when compared with plants that used 40 ng kg-1 AL. The results show that the control plan can be used effectively for early warning of occurrence of high AFM1 contamination of milk and to carry out pro-active measures to limit the level of contamination. Estimation of dietary exposure was also carried out, based on the aflatoxin M1 content of the milk samples and on Italian food consumption data. Estimated Daily Intakes (EDI) and Hazard Indices (HI) were calculated for different age groups of the population. HIs show that no adverse effects are expected for the adult population, but in the case of children under age three, the approximate HI values were considerably higher.

A fault-tree scenario pathway and modular process risk model approach were used for exposure assessment. Hazard characterization was based on a socioeconomic study with dose-responses derived from the literature. We used a probabilistic approach with Monte Carlo simulation and inputs from farm and household surveys. The qualitative analysis suggested a low to moderate risk of infection from consuming milk and that the widespread consumer practice of boiling milk before consumption was an important risk mitigator. Quantitative analysis revealed that two to three symptomatic STEC infections could be expected for every 10,000 unpasteurized milk portions consumed, with a possible range of 0 to 22 symptomatic cases. Sensitivity analyses to assess the uncertainty and variability associated with the model revealed that the factor with the greatest influence on disease incidence was the prevalence of STEC in dairy cattle.

Raw milk, the common raw material of dairy products, is vulnerable to climate change, influenced by changes in average temperature and amount of precipitation. This would induce changes in the microbial profile and heat stress in lactating cows, increasing susceptibility to microbial infection and higher levels of microbial contamination. Moreover, climate change affects the entire dairy supply chain and necessitates adaptation of all the current food safety management programs. In particular, the review of current prerequisite programs might be needed as well as revisiting the current microbial specifications of the receiving dairy products and the introduction of new pretreatments with stringent processing regimes. The effects on microbial changes during distribution and consumer handling also would need to be quantified through the use of predictive models.

The UC value for all 29 fields was estimated as 1.66, which agrees with the few soybean grain data in the literature. The UC value, however, is well below a conservative UC value of 4, recently recommended for all fresh legume materials fed to cattle. Soybean grain can contain high concentrations of Mo (>10 mg kg(-1)) and have low (<2:1) Cu to Mo ratios, which can exacerbate molybdenosis problems in cattle. However, soybean grain normally constitutes only -10% of dairy cattle diet, and other constituents (e. g. , corn grain, stover, mineral supplements) are sufficient, or can be manipulated, to control molybdenosis."

The partition blood-to-milk ratio for different antiparasitic compounds depends on their ability to diffuse across the mammary gland epithelium. The high lipophilicity of some of the most widely used antiparasitic drugs explains their high partition into milk and the extended persistence of high residual concentrations in milk after treatment. Most of the antiparasitic drug compounds studied were shown to be stable in various milk-related industrial processes. Thus, the levels of residues detected in raw milk can be directly applicable to estimating consumer exposure and dietary intake calculations when consuming heat-processed fluid milk. However, after milk is processed to obtain milk products such as cheese, yogurt, ricotta, and butter, the residues of lipophilic antiparasitic drugs are higher than those measured in the milk used for their elaboration. This review article contributes pharmacokinetics-based information, which is useful to understand the relevance of rational drug-based parasite control in lactating dairy ruminants to avoid undesirable consequences of residual drug concentrations in milk and derived products intended for human consumption."

Understanding the effects of processing and safety alternative proteins is paramount to ensuring food safety and understanding the risks to consumers. However, the data here is limited. With the expected further increase in protein alternatives in consumers' diets, the risk of food allergens is apparent. The occurrence of processing contaminants in plant-based alternatives may occur, along with anti-nutritional compounds, which interfere with the absorption of nutrients. Further, typical food safety hazards related to the plant, the product itself, or processing are relevant.

Maps of dairy cattle density were produced, and temporal patterns of disease rates were assessed for urban versus rural areas and for areas with different dairy cattle densities using descriptive temporal analyses.

Based on translational research, we identify milk as a major epigenetic modulator of gene expression of the milk recipient. Milk is presented as an epigenetic ""doping system"" of mammalian development. Milk exosome-derived micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) that target DNA methyltransferases are implicated to play the key role in the upregulation of developmental genes such as FTO, INS, and IGF1. In contrast to miRNA-deficient infant formula, breastfeeding via physiological miRNA transfer provides the appropriate signals for adequate epigenetic programming of the newborn infant. Whereas breastfeeding is restricted to the lactation period, continued consumption of cow's milk results in persistent epigenetic upregulation of genes critically involved in the development of diseases of civilization such as diabesity, neurodegeneration, and cancer. We hypothesize that the same miRNAs that epigenetically increase lactation, upregulate gene expression of the milk recipient via milk-derived miRNAs. It is of critical concern that persistent consumption of pasteurized cow's milk contaminates the human food chain with bovine miRNAs, that are identical to their human analogs. Commercial interest to enhance dairy lactation performance may further increase the epigenetic miRNA burden for the milk consumer."

Moreover, antibiotic resistance was evaluated using the disk diffusion method for pathogenic E. coli. Overall, 73.68% of contaminated samples by pathogenic strains were resistant to at least one antibiotic. The highest resistance was observed against streptomycin (57.9%), followed by tetracycline (50%). Additionally, all isolates were sensitive to amikacin. For evaluating biofilm formation, the violet crystal assay was applied on a polystyrene microplate well for pathogenic isolates. In total, 68.42% of isolates were able to form biofilms.

The web-based tool enables optimisation of thermal treatments with respect to product safety, quality and costs. It can be applied to existing products and processes but also to reduce time to market for new products. Important aspects of the tool are its user-friendliness and its specifications customised to the needs of small dairy companies. To challenge the web-based tool it was applied for optimisation of thermal treatments in 16 dairy companies producing yoghurt, fresh cream, chocolate milk and cheese. Optimisation with WebSim-MILQ resulted in concrete improvements with respect to risk of microbial contamination, cheese yield, fouling and production costs. In this paper we illustrate the use of WebSim-MILQ for optimisation of a cheese milk pasteurisation process where we could increase the cheese yield (1 extra cheese for each 100 produced cheeses from the same amount of milk) and reduced the risk of contamination of pasteurised cheese milk with thermoresistent streptococci from critical to negligible.

The objectives of this study were threefold: (1) to investigate the susceptibility of the amine groups of melamine to glycation with D-galactose, D-glucose and lactose, sugars commonly found in milk, (2) to study the rate and extent of melamine's glycation with methylglyoxal, glyoxal and DL-glyceraldehyde, three highly reactive metabolites of D-galactose, D-glucose and lactose, and (3) to characterize, using mass spectrometry, the Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs) of melamine with sugars found commonly in milk and their metabolites. Incubation of D-galactose, D-glucose and lactose with melamine revealed that D-galactose was the most potent glycator of melamine, followed by D-glucose, then lactose. Methylglyoxal, glyoxal, and DL-glyceraldehyde glycated melamine more extensively than D-galactose, with each yielding a broader range of AGEs. The non-enzymatic modification of melamine by sugars and sugar-like compounds warrants further investigation, as this process may influence melamine's toxicity in vivo."

The urgent need of sensitive techniques to detect this kind of fraud brought to the development of chromatographic, immunoenzymatic, electrophoretic and mass spectrometric assays. In the current work, we present a fast, reproducible and sensitive method based on the direct matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS analysis of milk tryptic digests for the detection of milk adulteration by evaluating specie-specific markers in the peptide profiles. Several pure raw and commercial milk samples and binary mixtures containing cows' and goats', cows' and sheep's and goats' and sheep's milk (concentrations of each milk varied from 0% to 100%) were prepared, and tryptic digests were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS.

Seven virulence-associated genes were selected (actA, inlC, inlJ, plcA, prfA, hlyA and iap) and their presence was investigated using PCR. All virulence-associated genes were detected in 51 isolates. One isolate did not show amplification of the inlC gene and one other isolate, previously mis-identified as L. monocytogenes probably due to atypical phenotypes, resulted negative by PCR for all virulence genes and was identified as Listeria innocua by 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. A multiplex PCR assay was used to evaluate the presence of markers specific for epidemic clones (ECs) of L. monocytogenes. The marker specific for the recently identified epidemic clone V (ECV) was detected in 38 of 43 (88%) of serotype 1/2a isolates. These findings suggest that Gorgonzola cheese can represent a significant source of L. monocytogenes and potential health risk for listeriosis as almost all isolates (94%) could be potentially virulent and that 38 (~72%) were presumptive positive ECV. PCR screening for both virulence-associated genes and EC markers may be useful for rapidly evaluating the epidemic potential and public health risk posed by L. monocytogenes in PDO Gorgonzola cheese and other dairy products."

Compared with previous studies that mainly assessed consumer confidence in food or dairy in general, this study focused on 2 specific dairy products, milk and infant milk formula (IMF). Based on data from 934 Chinese consumers, confidence in the safety of milk and IMF was measured by using a multi-item scale with 2 dimensions-optimism and pessimism. We found that Chinese consumers were optimistic about the safety of milk and IMF but, at the same time, were concerned about the risks related to milk and IMF. Chinese consumers have less confidence in IMF than in milk. Structural equation modeling indicated that consumer trust in manufacturers and third parties in the dairy supply chain and confidence in other foods, such as meat and fish, can foster consumer confidence in the safety of milk and IMF, while the extent of recall of the melamine infant formula incident in 2008 and trait worry exert negative effects. In addition, consumers with more children or less family income are likely to be more confident in domestically produced IMF. These insights into consumer confidence and its determinants can assist dairy supply chains and regulatory institutions in formulating effective risk communication strategies to strengthen consumer confidence."

This caused cases of gastroenteritis among young children throughout Australia. Another incident led to the discovery that salmonella serovars were colonising not one, but a number of dairy factories through the State. The second outbreak was of typhoid, stemming from a carrier working in a sandwich bar, and occurred during the course of the first, almost overwhelming public health resources and delaying investigation of the first outbreak. The background, recognition, course, investigation and resolution of these, previously unpublished, outbreaks are described, drawing upon the experiences of authors involved at the clinical, public health and laboratory levels, and preserved, contemporary records. Taken together, these outbreaks directly stimulated radical improvements in the construction and management of dairy factories in the State; initiated the adoption of risk management concepts in food factories; caused the launch of regional regulations compelling notification of salmonellas found in food manufacture; and led to the setting-up of an enhanced national, laboratory-based system for the collection, analysis and dissemination of information on enteric pathogens."

When ruminants eat AFB(1)-feedstuffs, they metabolise the toxin and excrete AFM(1) in milk. To control AFM(1) in foods it is necessary to reduce AFB(1) contamination of feeds for dairy cattle by preventing fungal growth and AFB(1) formation in agricultural commodities intended for animal use. Corn and corn-based products are one of the most contaminated feedstuffs; therefore risk factor analysis of AFB(1) contamination in corn is necessary to evaluate risk of AFM(1) contamination in milk and milk products. During the corn silage production, the aflatoxins production is mostly influenced by: harvest time; fertilization; irrigation; pest control; silage moisture; and storage practices. Due to the lower moisture at harvest and to the conservation methods, the corn grain is mostly exposed to the contamination by Aspergillus species. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the probability of this contaminant through choice of: hybrids; seeding time and density; suitable ploughing and fertirrigation; and chemical or biological control. Grains harvested with the lowest possible moisture and conservation moisture close to or less than 14% are necessary to reduce contamination risks, as is maintaining mass to homogeneous moisture. Kernel mechanical damage, grain cleaning practices and conservation temperature are also factors which need to be carefully controlled."

This organism produces a variety of extracellular toxins and virulence factors such as enterotoxin SEI and SEJ that contribute to its pathogenic potential. In this study 25 S. aureus isolates obtained from four dairy herds of Urmia region which is located in West Azerbaijan province in Iran. The tested isolates were identified on the basis of the cultural and biochemical properties, as well as amplification of the aroA gene which is specific for S. aureus. All isolates were also analyzed for the presence of the SEI (sei) and SEJ (sej) encoding genes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Seven positive isolates were detected for sei, but sej gene was not detected in any of the total number of 25 isolates. The present study revealed that the PCR amplification of the aroA gene could be used as a powerful tool for identification of S. aureus from the cases of bovine mastitis. Results of the present study also showed that the strains of S. aureus which cause mastitis can potentially produce enterotoxin SEI. Overall, our results suggest that it is of special importance to follow the presence of enterotoxin-producing S. aureus in other dairy products, especially for protecting the consumers from staphylococcal food poisoning."

The dioxins and PCBs were readily transferred into the milk, and at steady state, total toxic equivalents were concentrated 6-fold into the milk fat from the diet. Bioaccumulation was inversely related to chlorination number. The elimination of dioxins and PCBs in milk was biphasic. With the exception of 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodioxin and both octachlorinated congeners, dioxin and furan half-lives in milk were approximately 3-5 days for the alpha-phase and 35-50 days for the beta-phase.

This study aims to compare survival rates of Brucella abortus RB51 and S19 vaccine strains to that of virulent B. abortus 2308 strain during the manufacture of fresh and ripened cheeses. To do this, we inoculated fresh pasteurized milk with B. abortus RB51, S19, or 2308 at a 6 × 108 colony-forming unit per milliliter concentration during the cheese making process. Cheese was manufactured at room temperature, then, fresh cheeses were conserved at either 4°C or 25°C for 7 days, while ripened cheeses were conserved for 31 days at the same temperatures. We measured B. abortus survival and pH values during different stages of the process. Our results confirm that all three strains can maintain viable cells in both types of cheeses throughout the process. Survival of B. abortus RB51 was 10 times lower than was the survival of the B. abortus S19 and B. abortus 2308 strains in both fresh and ripened cheeses. Our results also suggest that both temperature and pH can condition Brucella survival. In conclusion, B. abortus RB51 and S19 vaccine strains can survive throughout the manufacture and conservation processes of both fresh and ripened cheeses. In turn, this implies a potential health risk if cheeses contaminated with these strains were to be consumed."

The ICA allowed detection of CIP and CAP in a panel of dairy products by employing a simple procedure of preliminary sample preparation. The detection limits for the two antibiotics were the same as in PBST. The analytical recoveries of CIP and CAP in dairy products ranged from 83% to 120%.

This food-oriented approach was carried out by challenge testing, generally at 15 and 10 degrees C for L. monocytogenes, E. coli, B. cereus, and Salmonella and at 25 and 20 degrees C for C. perfringens. About 222 kinetics in foods were generated. The results were compared to simulations generated by existing software, such as PMP. The bias factor was also calculated.

Consumers may be overly exposed to PAHs through dairies causing health risks. Hazards can be reduced by controlling influencing factors in the full-chain of dairy production. This review briefly introduces research trends and analytical methods concerning PAHs in dairies. Additionally, this review discusses influencing factors of PAH concentrations in various dairies to avoid PAHs' formation and accumulation during manufacture. Relevant regulations are referred to and the reported risk assessment methods are summarized. Furthermore, indicators of health risks including TEQBaP, the number and the rate of over-standard are calculated based on PAH concentrations. Through analyses, we find PAH and BaP contamination in dairies are complex problems depending on environment, processing and storage. There was a significant correlation between fat contents and PAH concentrations. Results of infant formula in certain research were worrying and those of smoked cheeses are remarkably high indicating the dangerous smoking process. It is significant to monitor PAHs and calculate TEQBaP from meadows to feeders. Moreover, the existing regulations are insufficient and need strengthening.

","This paper reports levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in a wide range of foods of animal origin and estimates their dietary exposure for secondary school students in Hong Kong, China. Dietary exposure to PBDEs was estimated using local food consumption data obtained from secondary school students in 2000 and the concentrations of PBDEs in food samples taken from local market in 2008. The PBDE levels on a fresh weight basis for fish ranged from 13 to 6600 pg g(-1), for seafood and seafood products ranged from 15 to 1200 pg g(-1), for meat and meat products ranged from 23 to 3500 pg g(-1), for poultry ranged from 68 to 670 pg g(-1), for eggs ranged from 280 to 800 pg g(-1), and for dairy products ranged from 12 to 480 pg g(-1). The dietary exposures of secondary school students for the average and high consumers were estimated to be 2.6 and 6.4 ng kg(-1) body weight day(-1), respectively. According to the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), for the more toxic PBDE congeners, adverse effects would be unlikely to occur in laboratory animals at doses of less than approximately 100 microg kg(-1) body weight day(-1). The resulting margins of exposures (38,000 for average consumers and 16,000 for high consumers) showed that the estimated dietary exposures of secondary school students were far below any adverse effect dose observed in laboratory animals and were therefore of low concern for human health."

Combination of nisin with LAE has higher synergistic preservative effect on different widespread foodborne pathogens such as Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium sporogenes and Escherichia coli compared with individual one. The most sensitive strain was E. coli with an effective minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) of 400 ppm, whereas the former spore‐forming bacterial strains were totally inhibited using 700 ppm from the combination, respectively. Synergistic combination blend was added by its recommended MIC (700 ppm) in the manufacture of both RFC and PCS.

The production and handling conditions of milk, a rich medium, promote inevitably the entrance of microbial contaminants, with notable impact on the quality and safety of raw milk and dairy products. Moreover, the persistence of high concentrations of microorganisms (especially bacteria and bacterial spores) in biofilms (BFs) present on dairy equipment or environments constitutes an additional major source of milk contamination from pre- to post-processing stages: in dairies, BFs represent a major concern regarding the risks of disease outbreaks and are often associated with significant economic losses.

Sorption isotherms of both compounds were nonlinear, and the Freundlich equation was found adequate to describe the isotherms. The sorption potential of E1-3S was about one order of magnitude lower than for the free counterpart, and the Kf values significantly changed between the two mediator solutions.

The aim of this paper was to review the available literature on the health and hygiene parameters as well as on the potential microbiological hazards in horse and donkey milk and the risks related to their consumption. Both microbial contamination and somatic cell count are reasonably low in equine milk and also the presence of pathogens, like Escherichia coli O157, Salmonella spp. , Campylobacter spp. , Yersinia enterocolitica, Brucella spp. , Mycobacterium spp. , Bacillus cereus, Cronobacter sakazakii, Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus, Rhodococcus equi, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, Clostridium difficile and Burkholderia mallei is low. However, in those regions of the world where the prevalence of Brucella spp. and Rhodococcus equi is high, the alimentary risks could increase. Similarly, in areas with higher incidence of immunocompromised people, the increased risks should be warned not only for pathogens but also for opportunistic microbiota."

The high reactivity of dityrosine enables this compound to induce oxidative stress and disrupt thyroid hormone function, contributing to the pathological processes of several diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, cognitive dysfunction, aging, and age-related diseases. From the perspective of food safety and human health, protein-oxidation products in food are the main concern of consumers, health management departments, and the food industry. This review highlights the latest research on the formation pathways, toxicity, detection methods, occurrence in food, and mitigation strategies for dityrosine. Furthermore, the control of dityrosine in family cooking and food-processing industry has been discussed. Food-derived dityrosine primarily originates from high-protein foods, such as meat and dairy products. Considering its toxicity, combining rapid high sensitivity dityrosine detection techniques with feasible control methods could be an effective strategy to ensure food safety and maintain human health. However, the current dityrosine detection and mitigation strategies exhibit some inherent characteristics and limitations. Therefore, developing technologies for rapid and effective dityrosine detection and control at the industrial level is necessary."

In this survey, the level of AFM1 contamination of dairy products marketed in Costa Rica was determined by enzyme-assisted extraction, immunoaffinity clean-up and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a fluorescent detector (HPLC-FLD) in fluid milk (n = 70), fresh cheese (n = 70) and sour cream (n = 70) collected at local convenience stores and supermarkets.

In 30 milk samples, and 10 cheese samples, AFM1 concentrations surpassed threshold concentrations as established by the European Commission. Thus, sour cream and - to a lesser extent - cheese manufacturing seems to reduce the amount of AFM1 present in milk, possibly due to fraction redistribution or microbiological degradation. The survey results reveal improper quality control procedures in the Costa Rican dairy industry. Therefore, a surveillance programme for dairy products in our country is recommended."

In planktonic culture, strains varied in resistance to low pH or high NaCl concentration and in the occurrence of an adaptive response to moderate acid or NaCl. There was dislocation in responses to salt and acid. Strains resistant, or adaptive, to acid were not resistant or adaptive to NaCl. The reverse also was observed. Exposure to moderate acid did not promote adherence to polystyrene but survival, at low pH or high NaCl concentration, of cells adherent to stainless steel was increased, even for strains that had no adaptive response planktonically, but the detail of these observations varied between strains. In contrast to acid adaptation, with some strains salt adaptation enhanced adherence of L. monocytogenes to polystyrene but this was not true for all strains.

            Dictionary: {}</s>","{'Corn silage': ['Aflatoxins', 'Trichothecenes', 'Ochratoxin A', 'Fumonisins', 'Zearalenone']}</s>","Ensiled forage, particularly corn silage, is an important component of dairy cow diets worldwide. Forages can be contaminated with several mycotoxins in the field pre-harvest, during storage, or after ensiling during feed-out. Exposure to dietary mycotoxins adversely affects the performance and health of livestock and can compromise human health. Several studies and surveys indicate that ruminants are often exposed to mycotoxins such as aflatoxins, trichothecenes, ochratoxin A, fumonisins, zearalenone, and many other fungal secondary metabolites, via the silage they ingest. Problems associated with mycotoxins in silage can be minimized by preventing fungal growth before and after ensiling. Proper silage management is essential to reduce mycotoxin contamination of dairy cow feeds, and certain mold-inhibiting chemical additives or microbial inoculants can also reduce the contamination levels. Several sequestering agents also can be added to diets to reduce mycotoxin levels, but their efficacy varies with the type and level of mycotoxin contamination. This article gives an overview of the types, prevalence, and levels of mycotoxin contamination in ensiled forages in different countries, and describes their adverse effects on health of ruminants, and effective prevention and mitigation strategies for dairy cow diets. Future research priorities discussed include research efforts to develop silage additives or rumen microbial innocula that degrade mycotoxins."

Imported cases, mainly in travellers but also in recently arrived immigrants, and cases associated with imported products, appear to be infrequently reported.

Most imported cases were associated with traditional risk factors such as travel/consumption of unpasteurized dairy products in endemic countries. Cases associated with importation of food products or infected animals also occurred. Although a lower disease incidence of brucellosis has been reported in developed countries, a higher incidence may still occur in specific populations, as illustrated by cases in Hispanic patients in the USA and in Turkish immigrants in Germany. Imported brucellosis appears to present with similar protean manifestations and both classical and infrequent modes of acquisition are described, leading on occasions to mis-diagnoses and diagnostic delays.

The latter was carried out using the 'yoghurt test' to determine the minimum IVM and MXD concentrations affecting milk acid fermentation. The sample clean-up, chemical extraction and the validated HPLC method allowed the quantification of IVM and MXD up to 0.1 ng ml(-1) in milk with acceptable validation coefficients. Drug recoveries from fortified milk samples ranged between 72% (CV = 9.1%) and 75% (CV = 13.3%) for MXD and IVM, respectively. Neither IVM nor MXD affected the acid fermentation of bovine milk. In fact, there was no drug-induced changes on milk acidity even at IVM and MXD concentrations as high as 1000 ng ml(-1). These results indicate that the yoghurt biological test is not suitable to evaluate the presence of milk residues for these antiparasitic compounds.

The intestine represents the first barrier against external contaminants; however, evidence about the combined effect of AFB1 and AFM1 on intestinal integrity is lacking. In vivo, the serum biochemical parameters related to intestinal barrier function, ratio of villus height/crypt depth, and distribution pattern of claudin-1 and zonula occluden-1 were significantly affected in mice exposed to 0.3 mg/kg b. w. AFB1 and 3.0 mg/kg b. w. AFM1. In vitro results on differentiated Caco-2 cells showed that individual and combined AFB1 (0.5 and 4 μg/mL) and AFM1 (0.5 and 4 μg/mL) decreased cell viability and trans-epithelial electrical resistance values as well as increased paracellular permeability of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, AFM1 aggravated AFB1-induced compromised intestinal barrier, as demonstrated by the down-regulation of tight junction proteins and their redistribution, particularly internalization. Adding the inhibitor chlorpromazine illustrated that clathrin-mediated endocytosis partially contributed to the compromised intestinal integrity. Synergistic and additive effects were the predominant interactions, suggesting that these toxins are likely to have negative effects on human health."

The quality of milk is monitored via somatic cell counts and total bacterial counts, with prescribed regulatory limits to ensure quality and safety. Bacterial contaminants can cause disease, or spoilage of milk and its secondary products. Aerobic spore-forming bacteria, such as those from the genera Sporosarcina, Paenisporosarcina, Brevibacillus, Paenibacillus, Geobacillus and Bacillus, are a particular concern in this regard as they are able to survive industrial pasteurization and form biofilms within pipes and stainless steel equipment. These single or multiple-species biofilms become a reservoir of spoilage microorganisms and a cycle of contamination can be initiated. Indeed, previous studies have highlighted that these microorganisms are highly prevalent in dead ends, corners, cracks, crevices, gaskets, valves and the joints of stainless steel equipment used in the dairy manufacturing plants. Hence, adequate monitoring and control measures are essential to prevent spoilage and ensure consumer safety. Common controlling approaches include specific cleaning-in-place processes, chemical and biological biocides and other novel methods.

To meet the challenge of stemming the decline in consumption of fluid milk, the dairy industry must take a systematic approach to identifying and correcting for factors that negatively affect consumers' perception of fluid milk quality. To that end, samples of fluid milk were evaluated to identify factors, with a particular focus on light-emitting diode (LED) light exposure, which negatively affect the perceived sensory quality of milk, and to quantify their relative effect on the consumer's experience. Fluid milk samples were sourced from 3 processing facilities with varying microbial postprocessing contamination patterns based on historical testing. The effect of fat content, light exposure, age, and microbiological content were assayed across 23 samples of fluid milk, via consumer, descriptive sensory, and instrumental analyses.

E. coli showed more than 50% resistance to amickacin, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, tetracycline and kanamycin while Salmonella showed high resistance to oxytetracycline, streptomycin, tetracycline and ampicillin. The MAR indexing of the isolates showed that they have originated from high risk source such as humans, poultry and dairy cows. The high density of faecal coliform bacteria and prevalence of multi drug resistant E. coli and Salmonella serotypes in the lake may pose severe public health risk through related water borne and food borne outbreaks."

Currently, 19 species are established or proposed; consequently, there has been an increase in the number of publications regarding Arcobacter since it was first introduced in 1991. To better understand the potential public health risks posed by Arcobacter, this review summarizes the current knowledge concerning the global distribution and the prevalence of Arcobacter in food and water. Arcobacter spp. were identified in food animals, food-processing environments and a variety of foods, including vegetables, poultry, beef, dairy products, seafood, pork, lamb and rabbit. A wide range of waterbodies has been reported to be contaminated with Arcobacter spp. , such as wastewater, seawater, lake and river water, drinking water, groundwater and recreational water. In addition, Arcobacter has also been isolated from pets, domestic birds, wildlife, zoo and farm animals. It is expected that advancements in molecular techniques will facilitate better detection worldwide and aid in understanding the pathogenicity of Arcobacter. However, more extensive and rigorous surveillance systems are needed to better understand the occurrence of Arcobacter in food and water in various regions of the world, as well as uncover other potential public health risks, that is antibiotic resistance and disinfection efficiency, to reduce the possibility of foodborne and waterborne infections."

There is a need to understand better the processes involved in the pathogenesis of Listeria monocytogenes-induced bovine mastitis. In the present report, we describe the results of the in vitro interaction of L. monocytogenes with bovine blood and milk leukocytes. Induction of an experimental L. monocytogenes mastitis resulted in a rapid and dramatic increase in neutrophils in the milk of infected cows. Blood neutrophils and mononuclear cells and milk leukocytes from listeria-infected and uninfected cows readily ingested L. monocytogenes in the presence of serum opsonins. These leukocytes also killed a portion of the ingested listeriae. Ingestion of listeriae evoked a vigorous chemiluminescence response by blood neutrophils and a relatively weak response by blood mononuclear cells. Ingestion, killing, and chemiluminescence by milk leukocytes were directly related to the percentage of neutrophils that were present. Blood neutrophils from healthy donor cattle ingested and killed L. monocytogenes when leukocyte-depleted milk and whey from mastitic cows were the sole sources of opsonins, although fewer listeriae were ingested than when normal bovine serum was present. These results indicate that bovine blood and milk phagocytes, like blood and inflammatory phagocytes from other mammalian species, can ingest and kill L. monocytogenes in vitro."

The aptasensor electrode fabrication steps were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR). Moreover, aptasensor performance during fabrication and binding of aptamer to streptomycin were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. After the binding of sreptomycin to it's specific aptamer as a component of the aptasensor a decrease in the current and an increase in the charge transfer resistance (Rct) were recorded using the above-mentioned techniques. Under optimal conditions, the novel ultra-sensetive designed aptansensor detects streptomycin in the range of 10-8 to 10-16 M with a LOD of 0.8×10-18 M. The aptansensor demonstrates a high selectivity, good reproducibility and acceptable stability for the specific detection of streptomycin.

Retail milk and yogurt samples present higher detection rates (39.6% and 48.1%) and mean concentrations (24.5 and 31.8 ng/L) of PFOS than those of PFOA (33.0% and 37.0%; 16.2 and 22.6 ng/L, respectively). For raw milk samples, only PFOS was detected. The differences in the levels of the two compounds between samples from the north and south regions were observed, and northern regions showed higher pollution levels than southern regions. On the basis of the retail milk measurements and consumption data, the ADIs of PFOA and PFOS for Xinjiang adults were calculated to be 0.0211 and 0.0318 ng/kg/day, respectively. Furthermore, the estimated intakes of PFOA and PFOS varied among different groupings (age, area, gender, and race) and increased with increasing age. Relevant hazard ratios were found to be far less than 1.0, and this finding suggested that no imminent health damages were produced by PFOA and PFOS intake via milk and yogurt consumption in the Xinjiang population."

Heavy metals, namely Cu, Zn, Cr, Pb, and Cd, were determined in water and forage from four locations as well as in milk produced by dairy cattle raised in these locations, using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. A quantitative risk assessment using probabilistic approaches was performed to assess the exposure of adults and children to the heavy metals via milk consumption. In milk samples, the highest levels of Cd and Pb were 0.18 mg L-1 and 0.37 mg L-1, respectively, which were above the international permissible levels. Possible sources of Pb in the milk could be the industrial by-products and wastes or automobiles exhaust gas. Significant (P < 0.05) positive relationships were found between the concentration of Cu, Cr, Pb, and Cd in milk and in the environmental samples (water or forage). Exposure assessment showed that milk consumers were mostly exposed to Zn, Cd, and Pb, with 63.7%, 51.2%, and 41.2% of children exposed to a dose greater than the references dose for these metals, respectively. Our results suggest that industrial activities lead to possible transfer of heavy metals to cows from their rearing environment (water, plant), which can be accumulated and cause potential health risks to milk consumers. The outcome of this study can be used by policy makers to manage the potential health risk."

PCBs and PBDEs are structurally similar chemicals and affect thyroid hormone function and behavior in children and laboratory rodents. Although coexposure frequently exists, the in vivo developmental effects of combined exposure to PCBs and PBDEs on thyroxine (T4) levels are unknown. We examined the effects of PCB and PBDE coexposure from gestational day 6 through postnatal day (p) 21, alone and in combination, on T4 levels in rat offspring. In males, exposure to PCBs and PBDEs at 1.7, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 μmol/kg/day induced equivalent and dose-dependent reductions in T4 from p 7 to p 21. Exposure to equimolar mixtures of PCBs and PBDEs at 3.4, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μmol/kg/day additively reduced T4 from p 7 to p 21 in males. In a second series of experiments, we determined sex effects on the mixture exposures and found that coexposure to PCBs and PBDEs had similar additive effects on T4 levels in male and female offspring. This study demonstrates that equimolar exposure to PCBs and PBDEs induces similar reductions in T4 levels and that coexposure to a mixture of PCBs and PBDEs has additive effects on T4 levels. These thyroid hormone effects of coexposure to PCBs and PBDEs are important when considering the cumulative effects of coexposure to multiple environmental thyroid hormone-disrupting agents in risk assessment for developmental disorders."

In this study, we report the genomic features of the first mecC-mediated, β-lactam resistant MRSA strain associated with livestock in Brazil and in the American continent. Three clonally related phenotypic MRSA isolates originated from a dairy herd were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction as mecC-harbouring MRSA isolates. Whole-genome sequencing was performed by Illumina Miseq platform. Downstream analyses showed that the strain was identified as the sequence type 126 (ST126) and spa type t605. In silico analysis revealed a mecC homolog gene in the orfX region associated with different penicillin-binding proteins. Moreover, genes encoding for efflux pump systems (arlR, mepR, LmrS, norA and mgrA), and antibiotic inactivation enzymes (blaZ and FosB) were also detected. Virulence analyses revealed that the strain harbours genes encoding for exoenzymes (aur, splA, splB and splE), toxin (hlgA, hlgB, hlgC, lukD and lukE) and enterotoxin (sea).

Data collected at Aurora Organic Dairy farms and processing facilities were used to build a LCA model for benchmarking the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy consumption across the entire milk production system, from organic feed production to post-consumer waste disposal. Energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions for the entire system (averaged over two years of analysis) were 18.3 MJ per liter of packaged fluid milk and 2.3 kg CO(2 )equiv per liter of packaged fluid milk, respectively. Methane emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management account for 27% of total system GHG emissions. Transportation represents 29% of the total system energy use and 15% of the total GHG emissions. Utilization of renewable energy at the farms, processing plant, and major transport legs could lead to a 16% reduction in system energy use and 6.4% less GHG emissions. Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis reveal that alternative meat coproduct allocation methods can lead to a 2.2% and 7.5% increase in overall system energy and GHG, respectively.

A sampling strategy within cheese production, which detects environmental contamination before it results in problematic food contamination, has benefits for food safety management. The liquid-based sampling strategy was implemented by both industrial cheese makers and small-scale dairies located in the mountainous region of Western Austria.

The liquid-based sampling strategy for Listeria monitoring at the plant level appears to be superior to solid surface monitoring. Cheese smear liquids seem to have good utility as an index of the contamination of cheese up to that point in production. A modelling or validation process should be performed for the new semi-quantitative approach to estimate the true impact of the method in terms of reducing Listeria contamination at the cheese plant level."

Therefore, a reliable, fast, and simple method needs to be developed to monitor antibiotic residues in milk samples before distribution to consumers. In this study, the first sensitive electrochemical sensor is presented for the determination of thiamphenicol (TAP), a broad-spectrum antibiotic in bovine milk. In the fabrication process, a screen printed electrode (SPE) was modified with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using ethylenediamine (en) as a cross linker. Cyclic voltammetry studies showed an adsorptive control process for the electro-oxidation of TAP at -0.1 V on the modified electrode of SPE/CNT/en/AuNPs. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was applied for the quantitative determination of TAP under optimized conditions (0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 6.0, accumulation potential -0.7 V, and accumulation time 150 s). A DPV study for TAP shows a wide linear calibration range of 0.1-30 μM with the detection limit of 0.003 μM. Furthermore, the developed sensor displays high sensitivity, reproducibility, repeatability, and good stability for the detection of TAP.

However, the traditional detection methods for nitrite and nitrate in dairy products restrain their applications to routine analysis due to the presence of certain limitations. In order to solve this problem, an improved national food safety standard method for the determination of nitrite and nitrate in dairy products has been studied. After water extraction, protein precipitation and centrifugation, the supernatant was cleaned up by a solid phase extraction (SPE) column. The eluent mainly composed of sodium hydroxide with acetonitrile as organic modifier. External water mode was used for suppressor. An AS 19 column was used as the analytical column, and the oven temperature was 30 degrees C while the cell temperature was 35 degrees C. The detection wavelength was 225 nm and the injection volume was 200 microL. The results showed that good linearity existed when the concentrations of nitrite and nitrate were between 0.005 -0.50 and 0.05 - 1.50 mg/L respectively. The detection limits of nitrite and nitrate were 0.2 and 0.04 mg/kg respectively when using a conductivity detector; while the values were only 0.02 and 0.01 mg/kg using an ultraviolet (UV) detector. The recoveries were between 84.0% and 104.1% when analyzing dairy products. It is a simple, fast and highly sensitive way for nitrite and nitrate detections."

The specific capture antibody was immobilized on the SPR chip which allowed a direct label-free detection of Salmonella Typhimurium with the limit of detection (LOD) of 104 CFU·mL-1 and the analysis time of 10 min. Alternatively, the secondary detection antibody was conjugated with horseradish peroxidase to provide a signal enhancement by the biocatalyzed conversion of 4-chloro-1-naphthol to insoluble benzo-4-chlorocyclohexadienone. The formation of precipitate was studied in detail by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The sensitivity was increased 40 times in case of the precipitation-enhanced detection compared to the label-free approach. The optimized method provided LOD of 100 CFU·mL-1 with linear range up to 106 CFU·mL-1. The total time of analysis including bacteria binding and enhancement step was below 60 min.

The FDA acceptance procedures have not required that bulk milk tests undergo a population evaluation; these tests have not been objectively evaluated for individual cows. Of more concern, detection limits differ among tests, sometimes approaching zero. Despite the intent of the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance, milk acceptability definitions vary between states. In addition, the predictive value of test results has not been integrated into the regulatory process.

Because of consumer complaints, a commercial dairy company shipped 4 samples of high temperature, short time (HTST)-pasteurized milk with distinctly gray colors to our laboratory. Bacterial isolates from all 4 samples were identified as Pseudomonas azotoformans. All isolates shared the same partial 16S rDNA sequence and showed black pigmentation on Dichloran Rose Bengal Chloramphenicol agar. Inoculation of one pigment-producing P. azotoformans isolate into HTST-pasteurized fluid milk led to development of gray milk after 14 d of storage at 6°C, but only in containers that had half of the total volume filled with milk (∼500 mL of milk in ∼1,000-mL bottles). We conclusively demonstrate that Pseudomonas can cause a color defect in fluid milk that manifests in gray discoloration, adding to the palette of color defects known to be caused by Pseudomonas.

Considering the widespread consumption of milk and milk products, the contamination of dairy products is a matter of public health concern. The aim of the study was to investigate the BPA contamination levels of raw cow's milk from two farms located in Campania region, Italy. The milk samples (n=22), weekly collected from the cooling tank, were analyzed using liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. In raw milk from both farms, preliminary results showed the occurrence of BPA levels lower than the SML limit, ranging from not detected to 2.34 μg/L. The consumer exposure, calculated considering a hypothetical raw milk consumption and three possible scenarios, was below the t-TDI. Despite the low levels of exposure through milk consumption, low doses can have lasting effects during human development. Thus, new approaches, methods, and plans should be applied to monitor ED contamination, such as BPA and other pollutants, and to assure milk safety."

Estimates indicate that in the United States, approximately a quarter of dairy products are lost at the production level or wasted at the retail or consumer level annually. Premature microbial spoilage of dairy products, including fluid milk, cheese, and cultured products, is a primary contributor to dairy food waste. Microbial contamination may occur at various points throughout the production and processing continuum and includes organisms such as gram-negative bacteria (e. g. , Pseudomonas), gram-positive bacteria (e. g. , Paenibacillus), and a wide range of fungal organisms. These organisms grow at refrigerated storage temperatures, often rapidly, and create various degradative enzymes that result in off-odors, flavors, and body defects (e. g. , coagulation), rendering them inedible. Reducing premature dairy food spoilage will in turn reduce waste throughout the dairy continuum. Strategies to reduce premature spoilage include reducing raw material contamination on-farm, physically removing microbial contaminants, employing biocontrol agents to reduce outgrowth of microbial contaminants, tracking and eliminating microbial contaminants using advanced molecular microbiological techniques, and others. This review will address the primary microbial causes of premature dairy product spoilage and methods of controlling this spoilage to reduce loss and waste in dairy products."

This metabolite is injurious to human health, but there is little information on the risk to human health posed by AFM1 in milk in rural Kenya. To fill this gap, a quantitative risk assessment (QRA) applying probabilistic statistical tools to quantify risks was conducted. This assessed the risk of liver cancer posed by AFM1 in milk, assuming 10-fold lower carcinogenicity than AFB1. Data from four agro-ecological zones in Kenya (semi-arid, temperate, sub-humid and humid) were used. We estimated that people were exposed to between 0.3 and 1 ng AFM1 per kg body weight per day through the consumption of milk. The annual incidence rates of cancer attributed to the consumption of AFM1 in milk were 3.5 × 10-3 (95% CI: 3 × 10-3-3.9 × 10-3), 2.9 × 10-3 (95% CI: 2.5 × 10-3-3.3 × 10-3), 1.4 × 10-3 (95% CI: 1.2 × 10-3-1.5 × 10-3) and 2.7 × 10-3 (95% CI: 2.3 × 10-3-3 × 10-3) cancers per 100,000 in adult females, adult males, children 6-18 years old, and in children less than five years old, respectively.

These impurities are presented by mycotoxins, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and persistent organic pollutants (POP). It has been determined that 46% of studied mycotoxins (n = 1500) and 100% of studied polyaromatic hydrocarbons (n = 45) and persistent organic pollutants (n = 55) are lipophilic compounds, prone to bioaccumulation.

A synthesis of reported exposure data relating exposure to PCP and its derivatives in an occupational setting has indicated that the PCDD/F intake for exposure in the 1990s averaged over a lifetime is likely to be in the order of 0.02-1 pg I-TEQ kg-1 bw day-1 with actual exposures more likely to occur at the lower end of the range, around the median of 0.16 pg I-TEQ kg-1 bw day-1. Workers who have experienced past exposure to PCP and its derivatives especially in the early to mid 1980s, will have been subjected to higher exposures to PCDD/Fs due to the generally higher concentrations of PCDD/Fs in PCP products at that time. Exposure to PCP and its derivatives via the food chain is judged to be the most significant intake route of PCDD/Fs into consumers. The ingestion of milk and dairy products obtained from cows grazed on pasture dressed with sewage sludge has the potential to raise the average daily intake of PCDD/Fs via the diet by about 40% if all foods consumed derived from sludge amended soil.

Further, indications of food safety such as violative antibiotic residues in milk have never been lower. Dairy foods provide essential nutrients such as protein, vitamin B12, and calcium, while there is also evidence that they are protective against chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease.

A growing body of evidence supports that chronic exposure to EDCs can contribute to a rapid increase in obesity among adults and children, especially in wealthy industrialized countries with a high production of widely used industrial chemicals such as plasticizers (bisphenols and phthalates), parabens, flame retardants, and pesticides. The main source of human exposure to obesogenic EDCs is through diet, particularly with the consumption of contaminated food such as meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, milk, and dairy products. EDCs can promote obesity by stimulating adipo- and lipogenesis of target cells such as adipocytes and hepatocytes, disrupting glucose metabolism and insulin secretion, and impacting hormonal appetite/satiety regulation. In vitro models still play an essential role in investigating potential environmental obesogens. The review aimed to provide information on currently available two-dimensional (2D) in vitro animal and human cell models applied for studying the mechanisms of obesogenic action of various industrial chemicals such as food contaminants. The advantages and limitations of in vitro models representing the crucial endocrine tissue (adipose tissue) and organs (liver and pancreas) involved in the etiology of obesity and metabolic diseases, which are applied to evaluate the effects of obesogenic EDCs and their disruption activity, were thoroughly and critically discussed."

The peak values for AFM1 concentration in milk was observed in milk collected during the milking at 3 and 6h. After the peak, the AFM1 in milk disappeared with a trend that fitted well a monoexponential decreasing function, and the toxin was not detected after 84 h.

Organochlorine, organophosphate, synthetic pyrethroid and/or triazine were found in fluid milk, powder products, yogurts, cheese, butter, and sour cream. Thermal processing reduced most residue levels, although some treatments increased total hexachlorocyclohexane and its isomers (α-, γ-, δ-, and β-). Emerging non-thermal treatments presented promising results, but some by-products had higher toxicity than their precursors. Biodegradation by lactic acid bacteria were effective during yogurt and cheese fermentation. However, β-hexachlorocyclohexane level seems to increase in yogurts containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, while increase or maintenance of pesticide residue concentration was observed during coagulation and cheese maturation.

Fecal prevalence of Salmonella fluctuated throughout the observation period and ranged from 8 to 88%. Manure composites and water trough samples were collected along with the fecal samples, and bulk milk and milk filters were cultured for the presence of Salmonella on a weekly basis. Over 90% of the manure composites--representing high-animal-traffic areas-were positive at each sampling. Salmonella was detected in 11% of milk samples and in 66% of the milk filters. Results of weekly bulk milk quality testing (i. e. , bulk tank somatic cell score, standard plate count, preliminary incubation count) were typically well within acceptable ranges. Milk quality variables had low correlations with herd Salmonella fecal prevalence. When observed over time, sampling period average prevalence of Salmonella in milk filters closely paralleled fecal prevalence of Salmonella in the herd.

Among these, diclofenac (DCF), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is extensively used in Pakistan which may lead to its accumulation in both terrestrial and aquatic environment. Present study aims to assess the presence and concentration of pharmaceutically active drug (DCF) in surface water and wastewater of twin cities of Pakistan (Rawalpindi and Islamabad). For this purpose, a validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was adopted involving solid-phase extraction procedure. Wastewater samples were collected from various sites of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. Results of HPLC analysis revealed that DCF was extant with considerably high concentration, not only in wastewater but also in surface water samples. Concentrations as high as 216 μg L-1 was detected in Rawat industrial area and low as 8 μg L-1 was detected in dairy farm wastewater samples collected from Taramri. However, maximum DCF levels in residential wastewater and hospital wastewater were detected to be 105 μg L-1 and 34 μg L-1, respectively. Moreover, the highest detected level (116 μg L-1) was found in surface water of Sawan River. Further, results of ecological risk assessment revealed its possible toxic effects of DCF on various aquatic organisms."

For the first time, isolates of this region were assessed simultaneously by the polymorphism of the 3'-end coa gene and 16S-23S rDNA, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, antibiotic resistance phenotyping, and toxigenic arsenal. Although pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns showed a wider variation (discriminatory index 0.83) than the PCR-based methods, the internal transcribed spacer-PCR proved to be a useful and inexpensive procedure for conducting epidemiological surveys of S. aureus on a regional scale. Each dairy farm had its own resistance profile, and in two herds, 63% of the strains were multiresistant, probably due to the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in bovine mastitis treatment. No methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains were detected in this study; however, 93.6% of S. aureus strains harbored variable profiles of staphylococcal enterotoxin genes seg, seh, sei, and sej. Transcriptional analysis revealed that 53.3% of staphylococcal enterotoxin genes actually transcribed, pointing out the food poisoning risk of these dairy products to consumers in the region. Based on the detection of the most prevalent clones in a herd or region, appropriate antibiotic therapy and specific immunization can be used for the treatment and control of staphylococcal mastitis."

Cheeses were contaminated with different STEC serotypes (O157:H7, O26:H11, O103:H2, and O145:H28) at the milk preparation stage. STEC growth and survival were monitored on selective media during the entire manufacturing process. STEC grew (2 to 3 log(10) CFU · g(-1)) in blue-type cheese and the two uncooked pressed cheeses during the first 24 h of cheese making. Then, STEC levels progressively decreased in cheeses that were ripened for more than 6 months. In cooked cheese and in lactic cheese with a long acidic coagulation step (pH < 4.5), STEC did not grow. Their levels decreased after the cooking step in the cooked cheese and after the coagulation step in the lactic cheese, but STEC was still detectable at the end of ripening and storage. A serotype effect was found: in all cheeses studied, serotype O157:H7 grew less strongly and was less persistent than the others serotypes. This study improves knowledge of the behavior of different STEC serotypes in various raw-milk cheeses."

MTGase is capable of forming both inter- and intra-molecular isopeptide bonds in various food proteins by cross-linking the amino acid residues of protein bound glutamine (acyle donor) and lysine (acyle receptor). The use of MTGase has increased for various dairy-based systems to promote and develop desired functional changes in dairy products. The specificity of MTGase towards milk proteins and the bioavailability of cross-linked proteins are key factors for industry and consumer preferences. Various attempts have been made to utilize MTGase to improve yield and to advance the functional properties of cheese types, fermented milks, milk powders, caseinate and other dairy products, which are discussed hereby. The implication of MTGase in dairy protein-based products alters the technological/functional properties of milk proteins, including gelation, heat stability, viscosity, emulsification, water holding capacity and foaming stability. Variations in the reaction conditions such as enzyme concentration, temperature, pH, substrate availability and specificity enable varying grades of protein modification. MTGase is considered since 1998 as GRAS; generally recognized as safe, and is recognized as a safe substance for human intake.

The occurrence of Listeria species by region was noticeable different. Listeria monocytogenes prevailed in South Portugal dairies and L. innocua presented the highest occurrence in Azores, whereas L. seeligeri and L. ivanovii were detected in distinct regions.

For the three prevalent species, most of the genomic types were dairy and sampling time specific. Nonetheless, more than one type could be found in each dairy at a particular site and, in a few cases, even for different species. Some dairies also shared types, mainly for L. innocua and usually at the same stage of the production cycle. For L. monocytogenes, PCR serotyping was applied and 52% of genomic types were serotype 4b. An equal frequency of genomic types (24%) was found for serotypes 1/2b or 3b and 1/2a or 3a.

We carried out comparative measures of yeast oxygen consumption between simazine-spiked samples and blank samples. Percentage interference (%ρ) on yeast aerobic respiration was calculated through the comparison of aerobic respiration of simazine-exposed and non-exposed yeast cells. The method was optimized for raw cow's milk samples by using boric acid as fungistatic agent in order to avoid cellular proliferation. Overall, the results have shown that simazine can be detected up to concentrations five times below the EU legal concentration limits for drinking water (0.02 ppb) and cow's milk (2 ppb) (%ρ values of 18.53% and 20.43% respectively; %RSD ≤ 15%).

HMs in cheese samples presented low risk to human health. Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) values for Pb, Hg and Cd revealed a minimum exposure of the population to those heavy metals through cheese product consumption.

This is primarily due to their amino acid content, digestibility, bioactivities and their processing characteristics. One of the reported bioactivities of whey proteins is antioxidant activity. Numerous dietary intervention trials with humans and animals indicate that consumption of whey products can modulate redox biomarkers to reduce oxidative stress. This bioactivity has in part been assigned to whey peptides using a range of biochemical or cellular assays in vitro. Superimposing whey peptide sequences from gastrointestinal samples, with whey peptides proven to be antioxidant in vitro, allows us to propose peptides from whey likely to exhibit antioxidant activity in the diet. However, whey proteins themselves are targets of oxidation during processing particularly when exposed to high thermal loads and/or extensive processing (e. g. infant formula manufacture). Oxidative damage of whey proteins can be selective with regard to the residues that are modified and are associated with the degree of protein unfolding, with α-Lactalbumin more susceptible than β-Lactoglobulin. Such oxidative damage may have adverse effects on human health. This review summarises how whey proteins can modulate cellular redox pathways and conversely how whey proteins can be oxidised during processing. Given the extensive processing steps that whey proteins are often subjected to, we conclude that oxidation during processing is likely to compromise the positive health attributes associated with whey proteins."

The dietary intake of HCB was subsequently estimated for the population of Catalonia, and the results were compared with those of a survey performed in 2000. The highest HCB concentrations were found in oils and fats, fish and seafood, and dairy products, with mean levels of 0.481, 0.330, and 0.284 ng/g of fresh weight, respectively. HCB intake was estimated for four population groups: children, adolescents, adults, and seniors (aged >65 years). The highest and lowest HCB intake corresponded to children and seniors, respectively. Similar results were found in our 2000 survey. For a standard male adult of 70-kg body weight, in the 2000 study, total dietary intake of HCB was 166.2 ng/day (2.4 ng/kg of body weight per day), whereas in the current survey the intake was 71.6 ng/day (1.0 ng/kg of body weight per day). On a body-weight basis, it means a decrease of 57%, which was mainly due to the important reductions in the contribution of dairy products (mainly cheese), as well as those of meat and meat products and fish and seafood.

Buffalo, the common dairy animals of the region, are allowed to graze upon this vegetation. These animals ingest significant amounts of marijuana, which after absorption is metabolized into a number of psychoactive agents which are ultimately excreted through the urine and milk. This potentially contaminated milk is used by the people of the region. Depending upon the amount of milk ingested and the degree of contamination, the milk could result in a low to moderate level of chronic exposure to Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other metabolites especially among the children raised on this milk. This research was conducted to investigate the extent of passive consumption of marijuana by the consumers of potentially contaminated milk. Urine and milk specimens were obtained from buffalo and were analyzed for 11-nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THC-COOH) which is a major metabolite for THC. The analysis was done by using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. It was observed that during the months of June and July, 60 percent of the buffalo contained detectable levels of THC-COOH in their urine and 50 percent of these animals produced milk which was contaminated with THC or other metabolites. Analysis of the urine obtained from children with ages ranging from six months to 3 years, who were being raised on the milk from these animals, indicated that 29 percent of them had low levels of THC-COOH in their urine.

Two hundred and fifteen unpasteurized milk samples were collected from apparently healthy cattle (n = 72) and buffaloes (n = 128) reared on small farms, and from milk shops (n = 15) producing dairy products for human consumption. All milk samples were examined by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) to detect Brucella antibodies and Brucella-specific DNA, respectively. Using iELISA, anti-Brucella antibodies were detected in 34 samples (16%), while RT-PCR amplified Brucella-specific DNA from 17 milk samples (7.9%). Species-specific IS711 RT-PCR identified 16 of the RT-PCR-positive samples as containing B. melitensis DNA; 1 RT-PCR-positive sample was identified as containing B. abortus DNA. The detection of Brucella DNA in milk or milk products sold for human consumption, especially the highly pathogenic species B. melitensis, is of obvious concern.

The FEEDAP Panel considered that sepiolite is unlikely to be absorbed. Harmful amounts of residues of any chemical component in edible tissues/products, as a consequence of the use of sepiolite as a feed additive, are not expected. Sepiolite is not genotoxic and does not induce any toxicity effects following oral administration and, therefore, it was considered safe for the consumers. The additive was considered safe for dairy cows at the recommended use level with a safety factor of 2.5. The conclusion was extrapolated to other dairy ruminants but owing to the lack of sufficient data, no conclusions can be drawn on the safety of the additive for the other target species/categories. Based on the results of a chronic inhalation toxicity study, the additive is considered a respiratory irritant. Owing to the dusting potential of the additive and its silica content, handling the additive was considered a risk by inhalation for the users. It is not irritant or corrosive to skin or eyes. Due to the nickel content, it is considered a skin and respiratory sensitiser. The additive was considered safe for the environment. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that sepiolite was efficacious as a thickener-suspending agent, binder and anticaking agent in feed for all animal species under the proposed conditions of use."

A consensus of expert opinions and a field survey are used to validate a list of potential indicators and issues for assessing the conversion, which consider not only the European Community regulations for organic livestock farming, but also agroecological principles. As a result, the method includes 56 variables integrated in nine indicators: Nutritional management, Sustainable pasture management, Soil fertility and contamination, Weed and pest control, Disease prevention, Breeds and reproduction, Animal welfare, Food safety and Marketing and management. The nine indicators are finally integrated in a global index named OLPI (Organic Livestock Proximity Index). Application of the method to a case study with 24 goat farms reveals an OLPI value of 46.5% for dairy goat farms located in mountain areas of southern Spain. The aspects that differ most from the agroecological model include soil management, animal nutrition and product marketing.

A total of 108 samples, belonging to 11 food groups (vegetables, tubers, fruits, cereals, pulses, fish and shellfish, meat and meat products, eggs, milk, dairy products, and oils and fats), were analyzed by high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). The levels of tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and hepta-CNs, those of octachloronaphthalene, and the mean sum concentration of tetra-octa-CN were determined. The highest concentration of total PCNs was found in oils and fats (447 pg/g), followed by cereals (71 pg/g), fish and shellfish (39 pg/g), and dairy products (36 pg/g). In general, tetra-CN was the predominant homologue in all food groups except for fruits and pulses, which had greater proportions of hexa-CNs. The dietary intake of total PCNs was subsequently determined. For calculations, recent data on consumption of the selected food items were used. Intake of PCNs was estimated for five population groups of Catalonia: children, adolescents, male and female adults, and seniors. When the dietary intake of total PCNs was expressed in nanogram per kilogram of body weight per day, it was age-dependent, with the highest and lowest values corresponding to children (1.65) and seniors (0.54), respectively. The largest contribution to the daily PCNs intake came from oils and fats and from cereals. The result of the current study is the first published report concerning human exposure to PCNs through the diet."

Sixty-six isolates from the 31 samples were typed by Multi-Locus Sequence Typing to determine if these isolates were persistent or continuously reintroduced. Seven known sequence types (STs), ST1, ST5, ST30, ST97, ST126, ST188 and ST398, and four new ST were identified, ST3531, ST3540, ST3562 and ST3534. Clonal complex (CC) 1 (including the four new ST), known as an epidemic clone, was the dominant CC. However, there were no indications of persistence of particular ST. The resistance toward 11 antibiotic compounds was assessed. Twelve profiles were generated with 75.8% of strains being sensitive to all antibiotic classes and no Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains were found. The enterotoxin-encoding genes involved in food-poisoning, e. g. , sea, sed, see, and seg were targeted by PCR. The two toxin-encoding genes, sed and see, were not detected. Only three strains (4.5%) harbored seg and two of these also harbored sea. Despite the isolates being Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), the presence of CC1 clones in the processing environment, including some harboring enterotoxin encoding genes, is of concern and hygiene must have high priority to reduce contamination."

Molecular typing showed a heterogeneous group of farm isolates (non-HRS strains), but a clonal group of UHT isolates from diverse European countries and other continents (HRS-clone) suggesting a common source. During a survey of Belgian dairy farms for the presence of potentially highly heat-resistant spore formers, high numbers of these spores were detected in filter cloth, green crop and fodder samples. The strain collection showed a high taxonomic diversity with 18 potentially new species and with Bacillus licheniformis and Geobacillus pallidus as predominating species overall. Seventeen B. sporothermodurans isolates were identified, mainly originating from feed concentrate. Heat resistance studies showed the UHT resistance of B. sporothermodurans spores present in industrially contaminated UHT milk, but a lower heat resistance of laboratory-grown strains (HRS and non-HRS). Hydrogen peroxide, used as sanitizer in the dairy industry, was found to induce higher heat resistance of laboratory-grown B. sporothermodurans strains to a certain level. This indicates that sublethal stress conditions may affect the heat resistance. By transmission electron microscopy, structural differences at the spore level were found between HRS and non-HRS strains. The data indicate that the attainment of extreme heat resistance is rather multifactorial."

In this descriptive, retrospective study, we used official reports on infectious diseases from public health institutes at the federal and cantonal level, as well as epidemiological surveys. For comparison with animal brucellosis cases, we used the distribution data from veterinary surveillance. Since 2001, the number of infected people has rapidly increased and brucellosis has become a very important public health problem. In the period 2001-2008, there were 1639 human brucellosis cases and the number of cases increased every year. The morbidity rate over the study period ranged from 3.8 to 33.4 per 100,000 inhabitants. According to epidemiological surveys, in villages human brucellosis was transmitted mostly by contact with infected animals and their products, and in cities by consumption of dairy products made from contaminated, unpasteurized milk. When test-and-slaughter control approach was used, the prevalence of seropositive livestock was 4.6% and approximately 70,000 animals were slaughtered after testing between 2001 and 2008. From 1 June 2009, this approach was replaced with mass vaccination of sheep and goats. The large number of human brucellosis cases and seropositive livestock poses a very serious problem for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The solution may be the introduction of mass vaccination."

Over 95% of human exposure to these problematic chemicals occurs via the ingestion of fatty rich food like meat and meat products, fatty fish, as well as milk and dairy products. Several major food and feed contamination incidents in Europe during the years 1997 and 2010 revealed the necessity of establishing food and feed monitoring programs for dioxins and PCBs. Various monitoring programs carried out by the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) and the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO), suggest that cattle from extensive farming (suckler cow husbandry) exhibited higher levels of dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs) and exceeded with higher frequency the permitted maximum levels (ML) when compared to conventional raised cattle. The reasons for the higher levels are possibly due to higher levels of PCBs in green fodder (pasture, silage, and hay) when compared to the concentrated feed used in conventional farming. Additionally, an increased uptake of soil, which is known to be a risk matrix for the uptake of dioxins and PCBs in grazing animals, leads to elevated contaminant levels in the suckler cows and hence their calves. Furthermore, PCB point sources present on a farm from older building and construction materials (e. g. PCB-containing wall paints) might result in very high contamination of the animals and the meat produced from them."

The risks of BSE infection via MBM in Japan were examined quantitatively to estimate infectivity to cattle via MBM derived from a single clinically infected animal being rendered. Three routes of exposure were modeled: (i) feeding cattle concentrates containing MBM as an ingredient, (ii) feeding cattle concentrates contaminated with MBM from non-ruminant feed at feed plants and (iii) directly feeding MBM in supplemental form to cattle on farms. The effectiveness of measures designed to restrict the feeding of ruminants with ruminant MBM (feed restriction) as well as differences in the risk of exposure among regions were examined using the model. The model revealed that the median total infectivity fed to dairy cattle via MBM derived from one infected animal was approximately 0.49 cattle oral ID(50) (5th percentile=0.43ID(50), 95th percentile=0.54ID(50)). This value was reduced by 55% after the addition of MBM to cattle concentrates was restricted in 1996. The risk of exposure in dairy cattle was twice that in beef cattle. Comparisons of regional differences in exposure risk indicated that the risk was highest in a region where 14 of the 20 BSE cases reported to date were born. Our model suggested that the routes of exposure via MBM were unlikely to result in increased propagation of BSE in Japan. Furthermore, despite some regional variation, the risk of exposure declined further after the feed restriction was imposed in 1996."

We examined the effects of an environmentally relevant mixture of PCBs (Fox River Mix [FRM]) and a PBDE mixture (DE-71) alone and in combination on synaptosomal and medium dopamine (DA) levels and the levels of the DA metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in striatal synaptosomes derived from postnatal days (PND) 7, PND14, or PND21 rats. FRM elevated medium DA and reduced synaptosomal DA concentrations with greater potency than equimolar concentrations of DE-71. The effects of FRM, but not DE-71, were dependent on the age of the animals from which the synaptosomes were derived, with greater effects observed in synaptosomes from the youngest animals. We used Bliss' model of independence to assess the possible interaction(s) of a 1:1 mixture of FRM and DE-71 on synaptosomal DA function and found that the effects of the FRM/DE-71 mixture were additive. Furthermore, as for FRM alone, the effects of the FRM/DE71 mixture were greater in synaptosomes prepared from PND7 rats than in synaptosomes from PND14 and PND21 rats.

Also, contamination incurs huge financial losses to the food industry. Different methods are used for identification of the microorganisms isolated from food, which are based on phenotypic, immunologic, genetic, and spectroscopic techniques. Unfortunately, these methods have the following disadvantages: laborious, time-consuming, requiring a well-trained spectrometer operator with specialist knowledge, or very accurate, but complicated, and extremely expensive. In recent years, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been gaining increasing importance in the field of food microbiology. Unlike other techniques used for microorganisms identification, MALDI-TOF MS is more rapid, accurate and cost-efficient, and easy to perform.

Removal of AFB1 was a rapid process, with approximately 61 and 56% of the toxin taken instantly by L. fermentum and L. plantarum, respectively. Binding was of a reversible nature, and some of the bound AFB1 was released into the media by the repeated centrifugation and resuspension of the cell pellets. The stability of the bacteria-toxin complex was strain dependent, and L. casei was a stronger binder of AFB1 compared with the other bacteria. No toxin release was observed after 24 h. These findings tend to suggest that certain novel probiotic bacteria with high aflatoxin binding capacity could be selected for detoxification of foods."

Concentration of AFM1 (0.046 μg/l, 95%CI = 0.002-0.264 μg/l) in raw milk was estimated. The AFM1 concentration in milk was sensitive to the carry-over rate (r = 0.80), and milk yield in the first third of lactation during the spring-summer season (r = 0.11). AFB1 levels in silage (r = 0.22), pasture during the spring-summer season (r = 0.11), concentrate (r = 0.08), and cotton seed (r = 0.05) were the factors most correlated with AFM1 concentrations.

In addition, the percentages of the population exceeding HI values (HI > 1) for exposure to AFM1 for infants, toddlers, and other children were 45%, 49.1%, and 40.6%, respectively. Under this scenario, the most susceptible population at risk was children < 10 years old; therefore, it is necessary to establish measures to prevent contamination of AFM1 in milk and milk products."

BADGE·2H2O and BADGE are the most frequently detected and BADGE·2H2O presented the highest mean concentration (2.402 μg/kg). The most contaminated food composite is meats, with a mean ∑9BDGEs of 8.203 μg/kg, followed by aquatic products (4.255 μg/kg), eggs (4.045 μg/kg), and dairy products (3.256 μg/kg). The estimated daily intake (EDI) of ∑9BDGEs based on the mean and 95th percentile concentrations are 121.27 ng/kg bw/day and 249.71 ng/kg bw/day. Meats, eggs, and aquatic products are the main source of dietary exposure. Notably, beverages and water, alcohols were the main contributors of dietary exposure to BADGE and BADGE·2H2O, followed by animal-derived foods. Dietary exposure assessment demonstrated that human dietary BDGEs do not pose risks to general population based on the mean and 95th percentile hazard index with < 1.

The highest concentrations of metabolites in milk (31-39 ng/mL) were for 1-hydroxy pyrene at days 7 and 14 of dosing. The observed plateaus for 3-hydroxy phenanthrene and 2-hydroxy fluorene were lower (respectively, 0.69 and 2.79 ng/mL) but significantly increased in comparison to the control samples. Contrarily, 3-hydroxy benzo[a]pyrene was not detected in milk at any sampling time. These results suggested a notable metabolism of the parent compounds after their extraction from soil during the digestive transfer. Thus, the metabolization of fluorene and pyrene can lead to higher concentrations of metabolites than of parent compounds in milk.

The mortality of E. sakazakii under minimum reaction conditions (50 MPa) was 1.42%, which was increased to 33.12% under significant reaction conditions (400 MPa). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescent staining results showed that 400 MPa led to a loss of physical integrity of cell membranes as manifested by more intracellular leakage of nucleic acid, intracellular protein and K+. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis presents a downregulation of three functional genes (glpK, pbpC, and ompR), which were involved in cell membrane formation, indicating a lower level of glycerol utilization, outer membrane protein assembly, and environmental tolerance. In addition, the exposure of E. sakazakii to HHP modified oxidative stress, as reflected by the high activity of catalase and super oxide dismutase. The HHP treatment lowered down the gene expression of flagellar proteins (fliC, flgI, fliH, and flgK) and inhibited biofilm formation.

Genomic DNAs from a total of 450 raw milk including 200, 200 and 50 samples from cattle, sheep and water buffalo respectively were analyzed using nested PCR, targeting the internal transcribed spacer of E. bieneusi. Totally milk samples of 9 (4.5%) dairy cattle, 36 (18.0%) sheep, and 1 (2.0%) water buffalo were PCR-positive. A significant relationship was determined between mastitis and the presence of E. bieneusi. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of eight genotypes: two known (ERUSS1, BEB6) and six novel genotypes (named as TREb1 to TREb6). The genotype ERUSS1 and BEB6 were the most common genotypes, found in all cattle and sheep farms. Phylogenetic analysis clustered all the identified genotypes in Group 2.

Ten metabolites were found which differed among milk types, hence providing characteristic markers for identifying the milk. These metabolites were used to establish mathematical models for milk type differentiation. The limit of quantification (LOQ) of adulteration was 2% (v/v) for soymilk in bovine milk, 2% (v/v) for soymilk in goat milk and 5% (v/v) for bovine milk in goat milk, with relative standard deviation (RSD) less than 10%, which can meet the needs of daily inspection.

Air and dust concentrations remained elevated over 5 years between initial and follow-up sampling. Blood serum concentrations of PCBs in residents of the homes were generally elevated above the 95th percentile of a representative sample of the US population. Serum concentrations in residents and air and dust concentrations were especially high in a home where a resident reported use of PCB-containing floor finish in the past, and where the floor of one room was sanded and refinished just prior to sample collection. This case-study suggests that PCB residues in homes may be more significant contributors to overall exposure than diet for some people, and that use of a commercially-available PCB-containing wood floor finish in residences during the 1950s and 1960s is an overlooked but potentially important source of current PCB exposure in the general population."

The residual concentrations of OCP in milk have numerous harmful effects on health especially the children. Therefore, milk was analyzed using gas chromatography equipped with µECD for seven OCP residues, namely α-endosulfan, β-endosulfan, Endosulfan-sulphate, DDE, γ-HCH, Dieldrin, and DDT. Three hundred and sixty raw milk samples were collected from urban areas (10 areas of Lahore N = 300) and Dairy Farms (10 farms in Lahore N = 60) from September 2012 to September 2013. Samples were collected after an interval of 2 months, for 12 months. Mean values of OCPs in milk samples from urban areas were reported as α-endosulfan, β-endosulfan, Endosulfan-sulphate, DDE, γ-HCH, and Dieldrin with concentration of 17.44 ± 3.99, 35.74 ± 7.50, 20.28 ± 3.95, 2.51 ± 0.55, 0.93 ± 0.16 and 1.12 ± 0.18 µg kg-1, respectively, while the milk samples from dairy farms with concentration of 26.94 ± 4.63, 59.88 ± 6.76, 32.07 ± 4.51, 4.64 ± 0.48, 1.20 ± 0.17 and 1.93 ± 0.18 µg kg-1, respectively. None of the samples analyzed were found positive for the presence of DDT, just as none of the samples from area milk shops exceeded the Maximum Residual Limits (MRLs). γ-HCH and β-endosulfan were found higher in dairy farm milk samples than the MRLs.

These results and further advancements in scientific knowledge indicate there are no new human health issues related to the use of rbST by the dairy industry. Use of rbST has no effect on the micro- and macrocomposition of milk. Also, no evidence exists that rbST use has increased human exposure to antibiotic residues in milk. Concerns that IGF-I present in milk could have biological effects on humans have been allayed by studies showing that oral consumption of IGF-I by humans has little or no biological activity. Additionally, concentrations of IGF-I in digestive tract fluids of humans far exceed any IGF-I consumed when drinking milk. Furthermore, chronic supplementation of cows with rbST does not increase concentrations of milk IGF-I outside the range typically observed for effects of farm, parity, or stage of lactation. Use of rbST has not affected expression of retroviruses in cattle or posed an increased risk to human health from retroviruses in cattle. Furthermore, risk for development of type 1 or type 2 diabetes has not increased in children or adults consuming milk and dairy products from rbST-supplemented cows.

Among the mycotoxins, aflatoxins are very toxic and highly carcinogenic contaminants which affect the safety of many foods, and therefore endanger human health. Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1 ) found in milk results from the biotransformation of aflatoxin B1. Many efforts have been made to control the source of AFM1 from farmers to dairy product companies. However, AFM1 escapes ordinary methods of food treatment such as cooking, sterilization, and freezing, hence it appears in milk and dairy products. The presence of high levels of AFM1 constitutes an alarming threat as milk and dairy products contain essential nutrients for human health, especially for infants and children. For this reason, there is a pressing need for developing a fast and reliable screening method for detecting trace aflatoxins in food. Several analytical methods based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectroscopy have been used for aflatoxin detection; however, they are expensive, time-consuming, and require many skills. Recently, immunoassay methods, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunosensors, and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), have been preferred for food analysis because of their improved qualities such as high sensitivity, simplicity, and capability of onsite monitoring.

The dairy products of the two countries have a unique competitive trading advantage in the Chinese market. However, at a time when Chinese consumers are increasingly dependent on imported dairy products, a succession of whey protein scandals affecting New Zealand's dairy products in 2013 had a negative psychological impact on Chinese importers and consumers, and this even affected the import status of New Zealand dairy imports to the Chinese market. The present paper, based on the United Nations Comtrade Harmonized System, studies the role of Australia and New Zealand in China's dairy market. It calculates the trade competitiveness index, revealing the relative competitive advantages of Australia and New Zealand, and investigates the impact of the dairy products from these countries on China's imports from the rest of the world across six dairy sectors in the period 1992⁻2017. We find that, under the food safety laws, the relative dairy import prices, milk scandals, and Free Trade Agreements, together with the competitive advantages of Australia and New Zealand, had a varied impact on the corresponding Chinese dairy imports across the relevant sectors in the context of China food safety laws after the melamine milk scandal.

Data were available on milk fatty acid composition of 2,573 Canadian Holstein cows from 46 commercial herds enrolled in the Québec Dairy Production Centre of Expertise, Valacta (Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, Canada). Individual fatty acid percentages (g/100 g of total fatty acids) were determined for each milk sample by gas chromatography. The unsaturation indices were calculated as the ratio of an unsaturated fatty acid to the sum of that unsaturated fatty acid and its corresponding substrate fatty acid, multiplied by 100. A mixed linear model was fitted under REML for the statistical analysis of milk fatty acid unsaturation indices. The statistical model included the fixed effects of parity, age at calving, and stage of lactation, each nested within parity, and the random effects of herd-year-season of calving, animal, and residual. Estimates of heritabilities for the C14, C16, C18, conjugated linoleic acid, and total unsaturation indices were 0.48, 0.25, 0.29, 0.14, and 0.19, respectively. Phenotypic and genetic correlation estimates among unsaturation indices were all positive and ranged from 0.20 to 0.65 and 0.23 to 0.81, respectively. The estimates of heritabilities and genetic correlations for milk fatty acid unsaturation indices suggest that genetic variation exists among cows in milk fatty acid unsaturation, and the proportions of desirable unsaturated fatty acids from a human health point of view may be increased in bovine milk through genetic selection."

Then, hemolysin BL, cereolysin A and cereolysin B genes as virulence factors were investigated in the B. cereus isolates. The results show that in spite of significant decrease of the total count, the variation of B. cereus spores and aerobic spores was not meaningful during shelf life. It may be due to the sporelation of B. cereus in severe condition of UF‐Feta cheese. The results also show that B. cereus is well adapted to Feta cheese condition with low pH, and can present up to the end of shelf life. Moreover, in the detection of toxin‐producing genes, 30% of isolates were found to carry three genes. In conclusion, B. cereus isolated from UF‐Feta cheese should be considered as potential enterotoxin producers. Therefore, new efforts should be undertaken to restrict these organisms during manufacturing for food safety. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Bacillus cereus is a foodborne pathogen found in dairy products. However, some studies were reported that this microorganism cannot survive at low pH like UF‐Feta cheese. The results of the present study indicate that B. cereus can tolerate the acidity and storage temperature. In addition, occurrences of toxin‐producing genes which include diarrheal toxins provide useful information in risk assessment of food poisoning caused by B. cereus. Thus, the presence of it in UF‐Feta cheese may be potential risk factors for consumer health and should be considered a serious public health hazard."

FC and FS loads in a primary stream running through the farm were estimated at up to four stations (above the farm, above the steading, below the farm and below a pre-existing 0.6 ha area of open water/wetland), in summer 2004 and 2005. During this period, steading and field mitigation measures were being installed. We estimated that farm FC loads likely to cause bathing water failure were 8.9 x 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu) ha(-1)d(-1) (guideline standards) and 1.7 x 10(10)cfu ha(-1)d(-1) (mandatory standards). In 2005, the guideline exceedance risk (42%) was associated about equally with field and steading sources, whereas the mandatory exceedance risk (11%) was mainly due to steading sources. The pond/wetland below the farm reduced these exceedance risks to 20% and <1%, respectively, but was a source of FS at high discharge. The exceedence curves below the farm were similar in 2004 and 2005, despite lower flows and installation of pollution mitigation measures. The results suggest that further mitigation efforts on this farm should be focused on improving management of the steading FC sources and that wetlands to receive steading runoff can be cost:effective mitigation tools for faecal indicator pollution."

Data were received from 27 countries covering the period between 1998 and 2017 and three regions: the Americas (AMR), Europe (EUR) and Western-Pacific (WPR). Results showed that the top foods varied across regions. The most important sources in AMR were beef (40%; 95% Uncertainty Interval 39-41%) and produce (35%; 95% UI 34-36%). In EUR, the ranking was similar though with less marked differences between sources (beef 31%; 95% UI 28-34% and produce 30%; 95% UI 27-33%).

Corynebacterium kutscheri (n = 74), lactobacilli (n = 73), and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 56) were the predominant Gram-positive and Shigella (n = 10) the predominant Gram-negative bacteria isolated. The correlation between biofilm formation and AMR was significant (p < 0.05) for most cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. Heavy metal tolerance tended to be higher in biofilm producers at different metal concentrations. The pathogens isolated from dairy and non-dairy food showed a high burden of AMR, high propensity for biofilm formation, and heavy metal tolerance, and pose an imminent threat to public health."

As research in this area is somewhat limited and involves highly non-standardized light exposure conditions, the review includes, if deemed necessary, effects observed in other dairy products. Most of these effects may be explained by general lipid oxidation mechanisms combined with knowledge on the spectral balance between the singlet oxygen quencher, β-carotene, and the sensitizer, riboflavin. As determined by Lambert-Beer's law, β-Carotene absorbs light in a concentration-dependent manner, which would otherwise be absorbed by riboflavin, thereby inducing quality changes. Consequently, these processes may be prevented by total exclusion of light and by storage in an oxygen-free atmosphere. Unfortunately, quality changes are apparent at residual oxygen levels even as low as 0.5% in headspace, which is often considered an acceptable residual oxygen level in industry. For a given product composition, spectral distribution and photon flux of the light source determine the extent of quality changes, since photochemical processes have limited temperature dependence, in contrast to the consecutive lipid autoxidation process. Hence, precautionary measures include changes of light source and targeted prevention of photon flux relative to the cheese by use of creative packaging. In order to optimize packaging and display conditions, a substantial need exists for analytical methods, which reflect the sensory perception of the consumer. Once established, optimization to include marketing and consumer aspects will harbor no major obstacles."

The outbreak was traced back to a single dairy farm in southern Finland. Here we explore risk factors leading to the outbreak through epidemiologic investigation of the outbreak farm and through genomic and phenotypic characterization of the farm's outbreak and non-outbreak associated Y. pseudotuberculosis strains. We show that the outbreak strain persisted on the farm throughout the 7-month study, whereas the non-outbreak strains occurred sporadically. Phylogenomic analysis illustrated that the outbreak strain was related to previously published genomes of wild animal isolates from Finland, implying that wild animals were a potential source of the outbreak strain to the farm. We observed allelic differences between the farm's outbreak and non-outbreak strains in several genes associated with virulence, stress response and biofilm formation, and found that the outbreak strain formed biofilm in vitro and maintained better growth fitness during cold stress than the non-outbreak strains. Finally, we demonstrate the rapid growth of the outbreak strain in packaged raw milk during refrigerated storage. This study provides insight of the risk factors leading to the Y. pseudotuberculosis outbreak, highlights the importance of pest control to avoid the spread of pathogens from wild to domestic animals, and demonstrates that the cold chain is insufficient as the sole risk management strategy to control Y. pseudotuberculosis risk associated with raw drinking milk."

The cost-effectiveness of monitoring schemes was assessed using a model consisting of a simulation module and an optimization module. In the simulation module, the probability to collect at least one contaminated sample was computed for different sampling strategies (simple random sampling, stratified random sampling and systematic sampling) at each control point. The optimization module maximized the effectiveness of a monitoring scheme to identify the contaminated sample by determining the optimal sampling strategies, the optimal number of incremental samples collected, and the pooling rate (number of collected samples mixed into one aggregated sample) at each control point. The modelling approach was applied to two cases with different types of contamination. Results of these cases showed that, to identify the same contaminated sample, monitoring schemes with systematic sampling were more cost-effective at feed mills and dairy farms.

Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) is the metabolite of potential carcinogen aflatoxin B1, which can contaminate milk through the feed and is not eliminated by common processing heat treatment. An analytical method using immunoaffinity column for extraction and a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for quantification was developed for AFM1 in this study. An HPLC method with fluorimetric detection for the determination of AFM1 in yoghurt milk has been optimized and validated according to Commission Decision BS EN ISO 14501: 2007 by using the conventional validation approach. The procedure for determining selectivity, recovery, precision, decision limit (CCα) and detection capability (CCβ) of the method has been reported. The results of the validation process demonstrate the agreement of the method with the provisions of Commission Regulation 401: 2006:EC. A new HPLC method with fluorescence detection was developed to determine aflatoxin M1. The detection limit was 1 ng/kg for yoghurt. The calibration curve was linear from 0.1 to 3.0 μg l⁻¹ injected. The method includes a preliminary clean-up and the average recoveries determined on three different days at the concentration levels of 0.025, 0.050 and 0.075 μg kg⁻¹ were in the range of 72.57%-86.66% with RSD in the range of 2.56%-8.41%. The interday and interlevel mean recovery value, which has been used to correct routine analysis results, was 80%. The method is rapid, easily automatable and therefore useful for accurate and precise screening of aflatoxin M1 in yoghurt."

Due to their high prevalence in dairy and beef cattle, farms are considered to be potential sources of transmission of the parasites to surrounding bodies of water. Additionally, human sewage overflow events can also contaminate nearby water sources. Both protozoa have been detected in various species of shellfish, but a lack of consistency in methods for detection and viability assessments make it difficult to compare data and extrapolate results. Nonetheless, the detection of these parasites in shellfish destined for human consumption is necessary due to the public health risk that these parasites pose. There is currently no legislation requiring public health officials to test for these parasites in potentially contaminated shellfish or water, despite the increasing evidence suggesting the need to implement parasitological analyses. Furthermore, standard depuration procedures are ineffective at inactivating the parasites, and even supplementation with ultraviolet radiation requires extensive periods of depuration to effectively inactivate all (oo)cysts from bivalves. Although there have been no official reports of human gastroenteritis acquired from consuming shellfish contaminated with Cryptosporidium sp. and/or G. duodenalis, studies examining the efficacy of current monitoring and depuration standards in Canada are needed in the event that they are inadequate for the removal of potentially harmful protozoan parasites."

Due to their nutritional benefits there has been an increase in production and consumption over the past thirty years. For this growth to continue the safety and authenticity of dairy products needs to be maintained which is a huge area of concern. Throughout the process, from farm to processor, different sources of contamination (biological, chemical or physical) may occur either accidently or intentionally. Through online resources (the EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) and HorizonScan) safety and fraud data were collected from the past five years relating to milk and milk products. Cheese notifications were most frequently reported for both safety alerts (pathogenic micro-organisms) and fraud incidences (fraudulent documentation). Alongside the significant number of biological contaminations identified, chemical, physical and inadequate controls (in particular; foreign bodies, allergens, industrial contaminants and mycotoxins) were also found. Although the number of incidents were significantly smaller, these contaminants can still pose a significant risk to human health depending on their toxicity and exposure. Grey literature provided a summary of contamination and fraud issues from around the globe and shows its potential to be used alongside database resources for a holistic overview. In ensuring the integrity of milk during ever changing global factors (climate change, competition between food and feed and global pandemics) it is vital that safety and authenticity issues are continually monitored by industry, researchers and governing bodies."

The Panel cannot conclude on a safe level for cats. The exposure of the consumer to propyl gallate and its metabolites cannot be estimated owing to the absence of reliable data on residues of propyl gallate and its metabolites in edible tissues and products.

Since the introduction of the NY-PI, P fertilizer sales (farm use) declined from 14,470 Mg in 2001 (8.6 kg P ha) to 7,376 Mg in 2009 (5.0 kg P ha). Cost of fertilizer was not a significant covariate for the reduction in P use over time. Certified nutrient management planners were surveyed in 2011 to evaluate their perceptions of drivers for changes in P use. In addition, whole farm P balances were recorded for 54 New York dairy farms. The survey data illustrate key ingredients for success: (i) statewide awareness of environmental challenges through both regulations and extension programming; (ii) science-based, user-friendly tools that allow for farm-specific responses to the challenges; (iii) risk assessment of management alternatives through on-farm research; (iv) enforcement of regulations; and (v) existence of economically feasible alternatives.

This study was undertaken to evaluate six different fluid dairy products at lower phosphatase levels than previously verified using the Fluorophos Test System, a sensitive and precise method for ALP activity detection. Thirteen laboratories participated in this collaborative, international study to evaluate the fluorometric test at 20, 40, 100, 350, and 500 mU/liter and extend the scope of the method to include milk from not only cows but also goats and sheep. Initially, the statutory level of ALP measured fluorometrically was set to equivalent levels of colorimetric test standards (500 mU/liter). The European Union recently announced its intention of lowering the legal limit from 500 to 350 mU/liter and, in addition, setting a target value of 100 mU/liter, which if exceeded would trigger an investigation into the pasteurizer plant performance. At 500 mU/liter of ALP, this trial generated relative standard deviation of repeatability values of 6.48, 5.69, and 1.74% and relative standard deviation of reproducibility values of 14.66, 13.30, and 5.33% for all cow's, sheep's, and goat's milk samples, respectively.

In recent years, the public has become aware of severe cryptosporidiosis because of its incidence in AIDS patients and because of massive outbreaks of cryptosporidial enteritis among the general populace worldwide from contaminated drinking water. Livestock and human wastes that were laden with oocysts of cryptosporidia have been incriminated in some cases. Intestinal cryptosporidiosis of livestock causes a brief diarrheal disease and probably does not hinder lifetime production in most cases. However, serious disease and deaths may sometimes result from complications from other pathogens and various other detrimental factors. Adolescent and adult cattle can carry C. parvum but probably do not shed large numbers of the parasite. However, certain cattle of all ages shed billions of the apparently nonzoonotic Cryptosporidium muris, which also was first discovered in mice around the turn of the century. Cryptosporidium muris infects only the glands of the stomach (abomasum in cattle), usually causes no overt illness, but retards acid production. Protein digestion in the abomasum probably is retarded, and, in fact, milk production in cows that are chronically afflicted with C. muris is reduced about 13%.

This review focuses on innovative mixes of egg or milk with plant ingredients – especially legumes – to develop products in which interactions between animal and plant are not usually expected, such as dairy or egg gels, emulsions or foams. The opportunities offered by such products in terms of consumer acceptance, nutrition, digestibility and techno-functional properties are reviewed and discussed with respect to their risk-benefit ratios. In many cases, animal/plant mixes offer enhanced protein stability and synergistic interfacial or textural properties that make them a flexible tool for food design. Fermentation offers important prospects for the nutritional and sensorial enhancement of animal/plant mixes, through the multi-criteria application of microbial consortia. Animal/plant mixes enable reduction in animal protein consumption while preserving amino acid and micronutrient intakes and sensory properties.

Predicted results showed that even 4 times label dose did not lead to violative tissue residues in healthy dairy cows with IMM infusions. The predominant violations found in cull dairy cows may be caused by altered pharmacokinetics due to mastitis, other diseases, and/or interactions with other drugs, which have impacts on penicillin distribution and elimination.

Afterwards, enrichment factor (EF), accumulation factor (AF), health risk index (HRI), target hazard quotient (THQ) and target cancer risk (TCR) were determined. Mineral fertilizer exhibited the highest As and Cr content, while the highest levels of Cu and Zn were found in animal waste. The contents of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in soil were below the limits established by environmental regulatory agencies. However, a significant enrichment factor was found for Cu in soil with a history of PL application. Furthermore, high Zn contents were found in shoots and grains of corn and wheat, especially when the plants were grown in soil with organic waste application. Applications of organic waste and mineral fertilizer provided high HRI and THQ for Br and Zn, posing risks to human health. The intake of corn and wheat fertilized with pig slurry manure, swine deep bed, liquid cattle manure and industrialized mineral fertilizer did not present TCR."

These infections highlight the need to develop new preservatives to increase food safety. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have the potential to be further developed as food preservative agents and join nisin, the only AMP currently approved, for use as a preservative in food. Acidocin J1132β, a bacteriocin produced by probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus, displays no toxicity to humans, however it exhibits only low and narrow-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Accordingly, four peptide derivatives (A5, A6, A9, and A11) were modified from acidocin J1132β by truncation and amino acid substitution. Among them, A11 showed the most antimicrobial activity, especially against S. Typhimurium, as well as a favorable safety profile. It tended to form an α-helix structure upon encountering negatively charged-mimicking environments. A11 caused transient membrane permeabilization and killed bacterial cells through membrane depolarization and/or intracellular interactions with bacterial DNA. A11 maintained most of its inhibitory effects when heated, even when exposed to temperatures up to 100 °C. Notably, it inhibited drug-resistant S. Typhimurium and its monophasic variant strains. Furthermore, the combination of A11 and nisin was synergistic against drug-resistant strains in vitro. Taken together, this study indicated that a novel antimicrobial peptide derivative (A11), modified from acidocin J1132β, has the potential to be a bio-preservative to control S. Typhimurium contamination in the food industry."

Our study developed a methodology for optimizing sampling for monitoring multiple chemicals along the dairy supply chain. We used a mixed integer nonlinear programming approach to maximize the performance of the sampling in terms of reducing the risk of the potential disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in the population. Decision variables are the number of samples collected and analyzed at each stage of the food chain (feed mills, dairy farms, milk trucks, and dairy processing plants) for each chemical, given a predefined budget. The model was applied to the case of monitoring for aflatoxin B1 /M1 (AFB1 /M1 ) and dioxins in a hypothetical Dutch dairy supply chain, and results were calculated for various contamination scenarios defined in terms of contamination fraction and concentrations. Considering various monitoring budgets for both chemicals, monitoring for AFB1 /M1 showed to be more effective than for dioxins in most of the considered scenarios, because AFB1 /M1 could result into more DALYs than dioxins when both chemicals are in same contamination fraction, and costs for analyzing one AFB1 /M1 sample are lower than for one dioxins sample. The results suggest that relatively more resources be spent on monitoring AFB1 /M1 when both chemicals' contamination fractions are low; when both contamination fractions are higher, relatively more budget should be addressed to monitoring dioxins."

Thus, the development of a rapid and accurate AFM1 detection method is of vital importance for food safety monitoring. This work was to develop a novel electrochemical aptasensor for sensitive and specific determination of AFM1. The dendritic-like nanostructure was formed on the gold electrode surface by layer-by-layer assembly of gold-silver core-shell nanoparticles modified with DNA conjugates. In the presence of AFM1, the specific recognition between AFM1 and Apt caused the disassociation of the DNA controlled dual Au@Ag conjugates from the surface of the electrode, causing less methylene blue to bind to the surface and weakening the electrochemical signal. The more AFM1 there is, the weaker the electrochemical signal. Transmission electron microscope results showed that the successfully synthesized Au@Ag nanoparticles exhibited a core-shell structure with Au as core and Ag as shell, and their average diameter was about 30 nm. Under optimal conditions, the electrochemical aptasensor showed a wide detection ranging from 0.05 ng mL-1 to 200 ng mL-1, and a low detection limit of 0.02 ng mL-1. Moreover, the proposed strategy has been successfully applied to the detection of AFM1 in cow, goat, and sheep milk samples with satisfactory recoveries ranging from 91.10% to 104.05%. This work can provide a novel rapid detection method for AFM1, and also provide a new sensing platform for the detection of other toxins."

In this study, we developed a fast and simple method for detection of AFM1 based on a structure-switching signaling aptamer. This aptasensor is based on the change in fluorescence signal due to formation of an AFM1/aptamer complex. To generate the aptasensor, the specific aptamer was modified with FAM (carboxyfluorescein), and their complementary DNAs (cDNA) were modified with a carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) quenching group. In the absence of AFM1, the aptamers were hybridized with cDNA, resulting in quenching of the aptamer fluorescence due to the proximity of the aptamer's fluorophore to the quenching group on the cDNA. On the other hand, in the presence of AFM1, a structural switch in the aptamer was induced by formation of an AFM1/aptamer complex. Changes in the structure of the aptamer led to the release of the cDNA, causing the generation of a fluorescence signal. Thus, AFM1 concentrations could be quantitatively monitored based on the changes in fluorescences. Under optimized conditions, this assay exhibited a linear response to AFM1 in the range of 1-100 ng/mL and a limit of detection of 0.5 ng/mL was calculated. This proposed aptasensor was applied to milk samples spiked with a dilution series of AFM1, yielding satisfactory recoveries from 93.4 to 101.3%.

To estimate the ability of consumers to perceive the fraudulent addition of cow milk, a triangle test was performed, in which cheeses formulated with several different proportions of goat and cow milk were offered to 102 regular consumers of cheese. Detection threshold analysis indicated that almost half of the consumers were able to perceive adulteration at 10% (vol/vol) cow milk.

When no selective pressure was applied in culture-based isolation, the majority of E. coli and Enterococcus spp. collected were resistant to ≤1 of 16 and ≤2 of 12 antibiotics tested, respectively. In contrast, E. coli and Enterococcus spp. isolated using sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations of cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, or erythromycin were typically resistant to at least one and often multiple antibiotic types, which primarily consisted of certain β-lactams, quinolones, sulfonamides, phenicols, and tetracyclines for E. coli isolates and macrolides, tetracyclines, and rifamycins for enterococci isolates."

In this cross-sectional study (September to October 2021), 197 samples (87 unpasteurized buttermilk and 110 raw cow milk) were collected from dairy stores of Ahvaz, southwest Iran. The presumptive E. coli isolates were primarily identified using biochemical tests and then confirmed by PCR of uidA gene. The occurrence of 5 DEC pathotypes: enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), and enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) were investigated using M-PCR. Overall, 76 (76/197, 38.6%) presumptive E. coli isolates were identified by biochemical tests. Using uidA gene, only 50 isolates (50/76, 65.8%) were confirmed as E. coli. DEC pathotypes were detected in 27 of 50 (54.0%) E. coli isolates (74.1%, 20/27 from raw cow milk and 25.9%, 7/27 from unpasteurized buttermilk).

The foods covered the range of commonly consumed dietary items including dairy products, eggs (hen and other species), poultry, meat, fish, vegetables, etc. HCBD showed a low frequency of detection, whereas PCBz, HCB and PCNs occurred in most samples (ranges: <0.01 to 0.19 μg/kg; <0.01 to 3.16 μg/kg and 0.1 to 166 ng ΣPCNs/kg respectively). PCP (<0.01 to 1.9 μg/kg) was detected more frequently in meat products, offal and eggs. Fish, shellfish, eggs from all species, animal fats, meat, offal and meat products showed higher contamination levels, which is normal when investigating lipophilic POPs. These levels of occurrence are similar to more recently reported literature levels but perhaps lower, relative to historic data. This is not unexpected, given the restrictions/limitations on these chemicals within the UK and Western Europe. The estimated human exposure to population groups through dietary intake is correspondingly low and based on current toxicological knowledge, the levels in the examined samples do not suggest a cause for health concern. The data also provide a current baseline for HCBD, PCBz and PCP, and update existing data for PCN and HCB occurrence in foods."

Low-dose computed tomography screening has been suggested to improve the diagnosis of lung cancer in high-risk individuals. To make screening more efficient, it is necessary to identify individuals who are at high risk. We conducted a case-control study to develop a predictive model for identification of such high-risk individuals. Clinical data from 705 lung cancer patients and 988 population-based controls were used for the development and evaluation of the model. Associations between environmental variants and lung cancer risk were analyzed with a logistic regression model. The predictive accuracy of the model was determined by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the optimal operating point. Our results indicate that lung cancer risk factors included older age, male gender, lower education level, family history of cancer, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower body mass index, smoking cigarettes, a diet with less seafood, vegetables, fruits, dairy products, soybean products and nuts, a diet rich in meat, and exposure to pesticides and cooking emissions. The area under the curve was 0.8851 and the optimal operating point was obtained. With a cutoff of 0.35, the false positive rate, true positive rate, and Youden index were 0.21, 0.87, and 0.66, respectively.

The DNA and infectious viral particles of Vaccinia virus, an OPXV, have been detected in milk of naturally and experimentally infected cows. However, to date no reports have described the detection of Pseudocowpox virus, a PPV, in milk. Thus, we investigated the presence of PPV and OPXV in milk samples obtained from dairy cows from a Brazilian region with exanthematic disease outbreaks. From 2011 to 2014, 6 dairy farms with exanthematic disease outbreaks involving dairy cows, calves, and humans were visited. Twelve crusts of cows' teat lesions and 60 milk samples were collected. The crusts and milk samples were analyzed by PCR to detect OPXV or PPV DNA. According to the analyzed crusts, we detected PPV infection in 4 of the 6 visited farms, from which we investigated the PPV contamination in milk. From the 40 milk samples tested, PPV DNA was detected in 12 samples. Of these milk samples, 8 were positive for both PPV and OPXV. This is the first report of PPV DNA detection in milk samples from affected cows, indicating that the virus may be present in milk and potentially contaminating dairy products associated or not with OPXV. In addition to the lesions caused by direct contact, the presence of 2 or more poxvirus species in milk showed that the effect of zoonotic exanthematic diseases on public health and animal husbandry is relevant and cannot be overlooked."

Undesirable microorganisms constitute the primary hazard to safety, quality, and wholesomeness of milk and dairy foods. Consequently, increased emphasis has been placed on the microbiological analysis of milk and dairy products designed to evaluate quality and to ensure safety and regulatory compliance. The focus of dairy microbiology, however, remains largely on conventional methods: plate counts, most probable numbers, and dye reduction tests. These methods are slow, tedious, intensive in their requirements for material and labor, and often not suitable for assessing the quality and shelf-life of perishable dairy foods. With the exception of coliforms, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus, isolation and characterization of various organisms occurring in milk and milk products are seldom a part of the routine microbiological analysis in the dairy industry.

Here, we employed, for the first time, a silicon-based photonic immunosensor for the detection of mozzarella and feta adulteration with bovine milk. The photonic immunosensor used relies on Mach-Zehnder interferometers monolithically integrated along with their respective light sources on a silicon chip. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against bovine κ-casein was used for the development of a competitive immunoassay realized in three steps, including a reaction with the antiserum, a biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG antibody, and streptavidin. The implementation of this assay configuration significantly reduced the non-specific signal due to the cheese matrix, and allowed completion of the assay in ∼9 min. After optimization of all assay conditions, bovine cheese could be quantified in mozzarella or feta at concentrations as low as 0.5 and 0.25% (w/w), respectively; both quantification limits were below the maximum allowable content of bovine milk in mozzarella and feta (1% w/w) according to the EU regulations. Equally important, the assays were reproducible with intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation <10%, and exhibited a wide linear dynamic range that extended up to 50 and 25% (w/w) for mozzarella and feta, respectively. Taking into account its performance, the proposed immunosensor may be transformed to a new tool against fraudulent activities in the dairy industry."

Due to the serious health concerns associated with melamine consumption and the extensive scope of affected products, rapid and sensitive methods to detect melamine's presence are essential. We propose the use of spectroscopy data-produced by near-infrared (near-IR/NIR) and mid-infrared (mid-IR/MIR) spectroscopies, in particular-for melamine detection in complex dairy matrixes. None of the up-to-date reported IR-based methods for melamine detection has unambiguously shown its wide applicability to different dairy products as well as limit of detection (LOD) below 1 ppm on independent sample set. It was found that infrared spectroscopy is an effective tool to detect melamine in dairy products, such as infant formula, milk powder, or liquid milk. ALOD below 1 ppm (0.76±0.11 ppm) can be reached if a correct spectrum preprocessing (pretreatment) technique and a correct multivariate (MDA) algorithm-partial least squares regression (PLS), polynomial PLS (Poly-PLS), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), or least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM)-are used for spectrum analysis. The relationship between MIR/NIR spectrum of milk products and melamine content is nonlinear. Thus, nonlinear regression methods are needed to correctly predict the triazine-derivative content of milk products. It can be concluded that mid- and near-infrared spectroscopy can be regarded as a quick, sensitive, robust, and low-cost method for liquid milk, infant formula, and milk powder analysis."

The influence of temperature on the inactivation rate constant was quantified using the Arrhenius equation and was characterized by activation energy values of 214.8±4.6, 190.2±3.7 and 174.5±3.5kJ/mol in skimmed milk, whole milk and cream, respectively. INDUSTRIAL RELEVANCE: The kinetic data regarding inactivation of milk enzymes can be valuable in terms of implementing food safety management systems, including traceability of the heat treatment step as a critical control point for milk and dairy processes. Heat stability profiles of bovine milk γ-GT were examined with the object of being able to monitor heat treatments slightly or even more severely than typical pasteurization conditions by measurements of residual enzyme activity after heating. Assay procedure was limited to simple colorimetric method that would be most likely to form the basis of a quick, simple and inexpensive test. The importance of this work is related to the possibility of establishing potential markers to evaluate the destruction of the target microorganism associated with each heating process, taking into consideration the safety and quality aspects."

Given that H2S poses a significant health risk, it is important to determine the effects of different handling parameters on H2S emissions to prevent health risks to farmers. In this study, the effects of total solids (TS; 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11%) and mixing speed (100, 200, 300, and 400 rpm), duration (5, 15, 30, and 60 min), and frequency (one, two, three, and four times a day) on H2S emissions from two different dairy manures were investigated. The results indicate that the quantity of sulfur-containing substrate intake determines the potential of dairy manure to emit H2S because manure from cows fed with concentrate-based feed generates higher amounts of H2S than manure from cows fed with forage-based feed. The H2S concentration increased with TS concentration and reached a maximum of 1133 ppm at a TS of 9%; thereafter, it decreased with further increases in TS concentration. H2S emission increased with mixing speed with a peak concentration of 3996 ppm at 400 rpm. A similar trend was observed for mixing duration. However, there were no significant differences between the amounts H2S emitted at different frequencies of mixing (P > 0.05). The results indicate that mixing speed, duration, and TS are the major determinants of the quantity of H2S emitted from dairy manure. Therefore, to prevent health risks associated with H2S emission from dairy manure, it is recommended that the mixing speed and duration should be kept as low as possible, while a TS concentration of above 9% should be applied during the fertigation of dairy manure."

In addition, the estimated daily intake (EDI) and hazard index (HI) of AFM1 was determined by the following equations:(EDI= mean concentration of AFM1 × daily consumption of milk/body weight; HI= EDI/Tolerance Daily Intake). AFM1 was detected in 21 (84%) UHT milk samples and in 55 (87.30%) pasteurized milk samples. Seven (28%) samples of UHT and 21 (33.33%) pasteurized milk samples had higher AFM1 content than the limit allowed in the European Union and Iranian National Standard Limits (0.05 μg/kg). None of the samples exceeded the US Food and Drug Administration limit (0.5 μg/kg) for AFM1. EDI and HI for AM1 through milk were 0.107 ng/kg body weight/day, and 0.535, respectively. A significant percentage of milk produced by different factories in Iran (84% of UHT and 87.3% of pasteurized milk) was contaminated with AFM1. Therefore, more control and monitoring of livestock feeding in dairy companies may help reduce milk contamination with AFM1. As the HI value was lower than 1, it can be assumed that there was no risk of developing liver cancer due to milk consumption."

Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NLME) has been advocated as a suitable pharmaco-statistical method for the study of drug residues in milk. Recent developments in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling of intramammary drugs allow the combination of a mechanistic description of milk pharmacokinetics with NLME methods. The PBPK model was applied to NLME analysis of a data set consisting of milk drug concentrations from 78 healthy cows and 117 with clinical mastitis. Pirlimycin milk pharmacokinetics were adequately described by the model across the range of observed concentrations. Mastitis was characterized by increased variance in milk production volume. Udder residual volume was larger in cows with 1, or 2 or greater diseased mammary glands than in the healthy cows. Low-producing cows had a greater risk of prolonged milk residues. With the exclusion of the low-production cows, the model predicted that healthy cows required a milk discard time 12 h longer than that indicated by the label, and the diseased cows 36 h longer than indicated by the label. More pirlimycin was systemically absorbed in the gram-positive infected compared with the gram-negative infected or healthy cows, suggesting a greater risk of violative meat residues in gram-positive infected cows. Using NLME and PBPK models, we identified factors associated with changes in pirlimycin milk residues that may affect food safety. This model extends the verification of a simple physiologically based framework for the study of intramammary drugs."

The milk dioxin contamination impact model was designed for this purpose and also was used to estimate the net costs of control measures limiting the impact. Results obtained based on the assumption of the worst-case scenario in which the entire daily production of each business unit from feed supplier to milk processor is contaminated suggested that the financial impact of one dioxin incident would be €141.2 million. Another assumption was that the dioxin contamination started at one feed processing plant and was detected 2 weeks after initial contamination (the high-risk period), which would result in the involvement of 714 dairy farms, 26 milk processors, and 2,664 retailers. The stages of the chain that contributed most to the total net costs were the milk processor (76.9%) and the dairy farm (20.5%). If the high-risk period were shorter, i. e. , 3 days, the estimated total financial impact decreases to €10.9 million. Thus, early detection of the contamination is crucial for decreasing the number of food businesses involved and lowering the total financial impact. The most influential inputs of the model were the sale price of milk at the processing stage, the daily amount of milk processed per processing plant, the farm-blocking period, and the daily amount of milk produced per farm. However, the effect of these inputs on the total financial impact was less than 10.0%.

Using computer analysis, we recently identified nuclear aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding sites termed ""dioxin response elements"" (DREs) in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of efflux transporter ABCG2 (Accession No. EU570105) from the bovine mammary gland. As these regulatory motifs mediate regulation of target genes by AhR agonists including TCDD and prochloraz, we have systematically investigated the effect of both contaminants on functional ABCG2 transport activity in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells. TCDD or prochloraz doubled ABCG2-mediated Hoechst H33342 secretion. This effect was almost completely reversed by specific ABCG2 inhibitor Ko143. In further mechanistic studies, we showed that this induction was due to binding of activated AhR to DRE sequences in the ABCG2 5'-UTR. Receptor binding was significantly reduced by specific AhR antagonist salicyl amide. Induction of AhR by TCDD and prochloraz resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase of ABCG2 gene expression and transporter protein levels. As ABCG2 represents the main mammary transporter for xenobiotics including drugs and toxins, exposure to prevalent AhR agonists may enhance transporter-mediated secretion of potential harmful compounds into milk. Through identification of mammary ABCG2 as a novel target gene of pesticide prochloraz and dioxin, our results may therefore help to improve the protection of breast-feeding infants and the consumer of dairy products."

The effects of dry cow treatment and no treatment were compared, on new intramammary infections and clinical mastitis within two low cell count herds and two herds undergoing conversion to organic farming. The results will inform those restricting their use of dry cow therapy on the additional risk of new intramammary infection and aid in development of alternative management strategies. No cases of clinical mastitis in the dry period were observed in treated cows, whereas in the untreated groups a significant number were observed. Significantly more new infections at calving were found in the untreated group in all herds. In those quarters where infections were first detected at calving, the incidence of clinical mastitis was significantly greater in the untreated group in all herds. Clinical mastitis detection was significantly lower in organic herds. Untreated quarters infected at drying with Corynebacterium spp. or coagulase-negative staphylococci were found to have an increased risk of new infection by Streptococcus uberis or coliform bacteria.

Analysis of milk using ELISA revealed high contamination with an overall average of 3164.5 ng of AFM1/L, and significant differences (p < 0.001) between cities. The milk sampled from Gilgit, in northern hilly areas, had an average AFM1 level of 92.5 ng/L.

Heavy mean aflatoxin contamination was found in bakery waste (724.6 μg/kg), and cottonseed cake (600.8 μg/kg). Rest of the other feedstuffs had moderate to low mean aflatoxin contamination, ranging from 66.0 μg/kg in maize stover to 3.4 μg/kg in wheat bran. The mean aflatoxin level in commercial dairy concentrates was 32.7 µg/kg. About 80% of the total aflatoxin intake of dairy animals was contributed by cottonseed cake alone due to its high aflatoxin contamination and proportion in dairy rations. On-farm storage time of oilseed cakes varied (p < 0.01) in different cities but was not associated with aflatoxin contamination. The exceptionally high AFM1 contamination suggests that milk from peri-urban dairy farms is a serious public health threat in Pakistan.

Crude and Bayesian seasonal risk estimates for Cryptosporidium in dairy calves were used to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of C. parvum infection on dairy farms in the New York City watershed. Both global (Global Moran's I) and specific (SaTScan) cluster analysis methods revealed a significant (p < 0.05) elliptical spatial cluster in the winter with a relative risk of 5.8, but not in other seasons.

Quantitative assessment showed strains of Bacillus subtilis, the Bacillus cereus group, Paenibacillus polymyxa and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens to be strongly proteolytic, along with Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus pumilus and Lysinibacillus fusiformis to a lesser extent. Lipolytic activity could be demonstrated in strains of B. subtilis, B. pumilus and B. amyloliquefaciens. Qualitative screening for lecithinase activity also revealed that P. polymyxa strains produce this enzyme besides the B. cereus group that is well-known for causing a 'bitty cream' defect in pasteurized milk due to lecithinase activity. We found a strain of P. polymyxa to be capable of gas production during lactose fermentation. Strains belonging to the species B. amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus clausii, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, B. subtilis and P. polymyxa were able to reduce nitrate. A heat-stable cytotoxic component other than the emetic toxin was produced by strains of B. amyloliquefaciens and B. subtilis. Heat-labile cytotoxic substances were produced by strains identified as B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, B. pumilus and the B. cereus group. Variations in expression levels between strains from the same species were noticed for all tests. This study emphasizes the importance of aerobic spore-forming bacteria in raw milk as the species that are able to produce toxins and/or spoilage enzymes are all abundantly present in raw milk. Moreover, we demonstrated that some strains are capable of growing at room temperature and staying stable at refrigeration temperatures."

The presence of the analyte in the reaction mixture interferes with the synthesis of the copper nanoparticles and the subsequent drop in fluorescence can be correlated to the concentration of the analyte present in the solution. Analyte detection using copper nanoparticle-based assays is amenable for in-situ applications as the test does not require expensive reagents and can be performed at room temperature. However, expensive and sophisticated detection systems are required for the detection of copper nanoparticles due to the low fluorescence emission signal from these nanoparticles. This restricts the use of the technology to centralized labs. Utilizing a recently developed chemical technique for fluorescence enhancement, this paper presents the first report of a handheld fluorometer capable of detecting DNA-templated copper nanoparticles. The fluorometer is portable and constructed with low-cost, off-the-shelf components like a UV-LED and a PIN photodiode. The performance of the developed system is demonstrated through the detection of melamine in milk samples via the interference synthesis of copper nanoparticles. Melamine is an adulterant used in dairy products that is harmful to human health if present in levels above 1 ppm. The developed system is capable of detecting up to 0.1 ppm of melamine in milk samples with a linear relationship observed between the detector output and concentration of melamine in the range from 0.1 ppm to 100 ppm (R2 = 0.9979)."

In particular, trichothecenes mycotoxin produced by genus fusarium is agriculturally more important worldwide due to the potential health hazards they pose. It is mainly metabolized and eliminated after ingestion, yielding more than 20 metabolites with the hydroxy trichothecenes-2 toxin being the major metabolite. Trichothecene is hazardously intoxicating due to their additional potential to be topically absorbed, and their metabolites affect the gastrointestinal tract, skin, kidney, liver, and immune and hematopoietic progenitor cellular systems. Sensitivity to this type of toxin varying from dairy cattle to pigs, with the most sensitive endpoints being neural, reproductive, immunological and hematological effects. The mechanism of action mainly consists of the inhibition of protein synthesis and oxidative damage to cells followed by the disruption of nucleic acid synthesis and ensuing apoptosis. In this review, the possible hazards, historical significance, toxicokinetics, and the genotoxic and cytotoxic effects along with regulatory guidelines and recommendations pertaining to the trichothecene mycotoxin are discussed. Furthermore, various techniques utilized for toxin determination, pathophysiology, prophylaxis and treatment using herbal antioxidant compounds and regulatory guidelines and recommendations are reviewed. The prospects of the trichothecene as potential hazardous agents, decontamination strategies and future perspectives along with plausible therapeutic uses are comprehensively described."

Four phthalate compounds were considered: diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), benzylbutyl phthalate (BBP) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Intake estimates were calculated for the Belgian adult population and several subgroups of this population for two considered scenarios using an extended version of the EN-forc model. The highest intake rates were found for DEHP, followed by DnBP, BBP and DEP. In the Belgian adult population, men and young adults generally had the highest dietary phthalate intake estimates. Nevertheless, predicted dietary intake rates for all four investigated phthalates were far below the corresponding tolerable daily intake (TDI) values (i. e. P99 intake values were 6.4% of the TDI at most), which is reassuring because adults are also exposed to phthalates via other contamination pathways (e. g. dust ingestion and inhalation). The food groups contributing most to the dietary exposure were grains and grain-based products for DEP, milk and dairy products for DnBP, meat and meat products or grains and grain-based products (depending on the scenario) for BBP and meat and meat products for DEHP. Comparison of the predicted intake results based on modelled phthalate concentrations in food products with intake estimates from other surveys (mostly based on measured concentrations) showed that the extended version of the EN-forc model is a suitable semi-probabilistic tool for the estimation and evaluation of the long-term dietary intake of phthalates in humans."

Samples from cattle at risk for shedding Cryptosporidium organisms on randomly selected dairy farms in the NYCW. Feces were collected for 4 years from calves at risk for infection on 37 dairies. Oocysts were detected by use of centrifugation concentration-flotation microscopy. The DNA was directly isolated from fecal samples and used to amplify fragments of the small subunit ribosomal RNA and thrombospondin-related adhesion protein C-2 genes by use of nested polymerase chain reaction assays. Small subunit ribosomal RNA fragments were restriction digested by the enzyme Vspl and thrombospondin-related adhesion protein C-2 fragments were digested by Eco91l to distinguish between C hominis (formerly known as genotype 1) and C parvum (formerly known as genotype 2). Of 437 fecal samples examined, 214 contained oocysts. Amplicons were generated for 200 samples. We can be certain, with 95% confidence, that cattle in the NYCW did not harbor C hominis. Cryptosporidium infections in cattle are under examination because of the potential contamination of public waters by manure. Although cattle may be the source of zoonotic infection via C parvum, they pose little risk for C hominis (the strain commonly isolated from humans in waterborne outbreaks of disease). Other sources of oocysts should be considered when investigating outbreaks attributable to contaminated urban drinking water because cattle pose only a small risk via shedding of C hominis."

Seeking safe and effective mastitis prevention strategies is urgent since food safety and drug residues in milk remain an enormous concern, despite the contribution of antibiotics to control mastitis. Kynurenic acid (KYNA), derived from the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism, has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in many diseases. Recently, it was reported that impaired KYNA levels were associated with mastitis. However, the physiological role of KYNA in mastitis has not yet been elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the protective role of KYNA in pathogen-induced mastitis in mice, as well as the underlying mechanism of this effect. We first evaluated the effects of KYNA on LPS-induced mastitis in mice. Additionally, the underlying anti-inflammatory mechanism of KYNA was investigated in mammary epithelial cells (MMECs). Furthermore, we examined the effects of KYNA on S. aureus and E. coli induced mastitis in mice. Our results demonstrated that KYNA alleviated LPS-induced mastitis by reducing inflammatory responses and enhancing blood-milk barrier integrity. The fundamental mechanisms involved the inhibition of NF-κB and activation of Nrf2/Ho-1, which is probably mediated by G protein-coupled receptor 35 but not aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Notably, KYNA also protected against S. aureus and E. coli induced mastitis in mice. In conclusion, our results highlight the role of KYNA in mastitis and serve as a basis for using endogenous metabolite as a novel preventative or therapeutic strategy for disease intervention."

In total, 291 sampled milk products (raw, pasteurised, UHT milk, yoghurt and lala) were collected and analysed for AFM1 using a commercial ELISA kit. More than 50% of the samples exceeded 50 ng/kg (the level allowed in the EU), but only three samples exceeded 500 ng/kg (the level allowed in the USA). Geometric mean AFM1 level was 61.9 ng/kg in the 135 samples from the low-income area while it was 36.1 ng/kg in the 156 from the higher income area (p < 0.001). The levels varied significantly depending on the time of year, with lowest levels of milk in January. There were also differences between manufacturers and products, with UHT milk having lower levels. There was no difference depending on the price for all dairy products, but when only including milk, higher price was associated with lower levels of AFM1. In conclusion, this study shows that milk purchased by a consumer is likely to contain AFM1 above 50 ng/kg, and that further research is needed to find ways to mitigate AFM1 contamination through working with farmers and milk processors both in the formal and informal sectors."

Radiochemical analysis showed very low residues, with the highest being in the kidneys at 0.122 and 0. 128 mg equiv of CM/kg (AN and TP labeled compounds, respectively). Radioactive residues were extracted and fractionated from kidney, liver, and milk. Analysis showed approximately 0.066 mg/kg CM in the kidney but <0.003 mg/kg in the liver. Only one metabolite, cloransulam, was identified (in liver, 9.5% of total radioactive residue; 0.005 mg/kg). All other metabolites were present at lower levels. Sulfonanilide bridge cleavage was not a significant degradation route for cloransulam-methyl in ruminants. These data indicated a very low bioaccumulation potential for cloransulam-methyl and its metabolites in ruminants.

The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of enterotoxigenic S. aureus strains in raw milk supplied for dairy processing in the Czech Republic. A further aim was to compare the production of staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) with the presence of the corresponding genes. This was undertaken using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reversed passive latex agglutination (RPLA). Out of 440 bulk tank milk samples from 298 dairy herds, 70 proved positive for S. aureus (15.9%). Staphylococcal enterotoxin genes (ses) were detected in 39 (55.7%) isolates. The genes most commonly detected were sei (38.6%), seg (31.4%) and sea (27.1%). Genes seb, seh, sed, sej and sec were observed in 10%, 4.3%, 2.9%, 2.9% and 1.4% of strains respectively. Genes see and sel did not occur. The most frequently detected genotypes were seg, sei at 11.4%; sea at 10.0%; and sea, seg, sei at 8.6%. Toxin production was observed in nine (12.9%) S. aureus isolates. Seven strains were detected as SEB- (10%) and two as SED- (2.9%) producing. A relatively high number (32%) of discrepancies between the results with multiplex PCR and RPLA assays was obtained, particularly on account of SEA. Nineteen strains were sea positive by PCR but SEA negative by RPLA, and one strain was sec positive and SEC negative. The results of both methods were identical concerning SEB and SED. It was concluded that detection of ses by PCR was a useful additional tool to support identification of enterotoxigenic strains."

At the same time, consumer and investor interest for improved environmental benefits or reduced environmental impact of food production continues to grow. Following a trend of increasing greenhouse gas emission commitments for businesses across sectors of the economy, the US dairy industry has committed to a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The Paris Climate Accord's goal is to reduce warming of the atmosphere to less than 1.5 to 2°C based on preindustrial levels, which is different from emission goals of historic climate agreements that focus on emission reduction targets. Most of the emissions that account for the greenhouse gas footprint of a gallon of milk are from the short-lived climate pollutant CH4, which has a half-life of approximately 10 yr. The relatively new accounting system Global Warming Potential Star and the unit CO2 warming equivalents gives the industry the appropriate metrics to quantify their current and projected warming impact on future emissions. Incorporating this metric into potential future emissions pathways can allow the industry to understand the magnitude of emissions reductions needed to no longer contribute additional warming. Deterministic modeling was performed across the dairy industry's emission areas of enteric fermentation, manure management, feed production, and other upstream emissions necessary for dairy production. By reducing farm-level absolute emissions by 23% based on current levels, there is the opportunity for the US dairy industry to realize climate neutrality within the next few decades."

Between 2010 and 2012, in each study area, the following 9-step best practices were applied: hazard identification, GIS project creation, risk area delimitation, control area selection, receptors (livestock) identification, farms and matrixes selection, sampling study design, on-farm secondary sources exclusion, and statistical and geostatistical analysis. Dairy farms and free-range laying hens were the primary targets: eggs from both risk and control areas and milk from risk areas were sampled and submitted for detection of selected tracking contaminants compatible with the putative sources. Comparison data (risk vs. control) of heavy metal concentrations in eggs were available only for case study 2, whereas egg comparison data of persistent organic pollutants were available for all the risk-control pairs. After taking into account potential secondary sources, no concern from metals was arisen, whereas high concentrations of persistent organic pollutants were detected in all risk areas; however, only for the aluminum smelter case study, the contamination was broad and higher in the risk area compared with the control one.

However, M. paratuberculosis is an intracellular pathogen that resides within the macrophages of the host and evades destruction. We subsequently performed further experiments examining heat treatment of milk inoculated with mammary gland macrophages containing ingested M. paratuberculosis. Heat treatment of these samples under high-temperature, short-time conditions demonstrated that the macrophage does not protect the organism because we were unable to recover any viable M. paratuberculosis from the samples. Conversely, other researchers have demonstrated that a residual population of M. paratuberculosis may survive heat treatment of milk. In addition, a recent news report stated that viable M. paratuberculosis organisms have been cultured from retail-ready milk in Ireland.

The objective of this cross-sectional study was to identify risk factors for Alberta dairy herds being MAP-positive based on environmental samples (ES). Risk assessments were conducted and ES were collected on 354 Alberta dairy farms (62% of eligible producers) voluntarily participating in the Alberta Johne's Disease Initiative. In univariate logistic regression, risk factors addressing animal and pen hygiene, as well as the use of feeding equipment to remove manure and manure application on pastures, were all associated with the number of positive ES. Furthermore, based on factor analysis, risk factors were clustered and could be summarized as 4 independent factors: (1) animal, pen, and feeder contamination; (2) shared equipment and pasture contamination; (3) calf diet; and (4) cattle purchase. Using these factor scores as independent variables in multivariate logistic regression models, a 1-unit increase in animal, pen, and feeder contamination resulted in 1.31 times higher odds of having at least 1 positive ES. Furthermore, a 1-unit increase in cattle purchase also resulted in 1.31 times the odds of having at least 1 positive ES. Finally, a 100-cow increase in herd size resulted in an odds ratio of 2.1 for having at least 1 positive ES. In conclusion, cleanliness of animals, pens, and feeders, as well as cattle purchase practices, affected risk of herd infection with MAP. Therefore, improvements in those management practices should be the focus of effective tools to control MAP on dairy farms."

Although controversially, MAP has been suggested as the causative agent of Crohn's disease and its presence in consumers' milk might be of concern. A method to detect MAP in milk with real-time PCR was developed for screening of bulk tank milk. Pellet and cream fractions of milk were pooled and subjected to enzymatic digestion and mechanical disruption and the DNA was extracted by automated magnetic bead separation. The analytical sensitivity was assessed to 100 organisms per ml milk (corresponding to 1-10 CFU per ml) for samples of 10 ml. The method was applied in a study of 56 dairy herds to compare PCR of farm bulk tank milk to culture of environmental faecal samples for detection of MAP in the herds. In this study, 68% of the herds were positive by environmental culture, while 30% were positive by milk PCR. Results indicate that although MAP may be shed into milk or transferred to milk by faecal contamination, it will probably occur in low numbers in the bulk tank milk due to dilution as well as general milking hygiene measures. The concentration of MAP can therefore be assumed to often fall below the detection limit. Thus, PCR detection of MAP in milk would be more useful for control of MAP presence in milk, in order to avoid transfer to humans, than for herd prevalence testing. It could also be of value in assessing human exposure to MAP via milk consumption. Quantification results also suggest that the level of MAP in the bulk tank milk of the studied Danish dairy herds was low, despite environmental isolation of MAP from the herds."

To study the prevalence in unpasteurized milk from Swedish farms, bovine and small ruminant dairy farms were sampled. Since the sampling method and transport conditions may influence the outcome of analyses, efforts were made to optimize the methodology. Culturing of bacteria was done from in-line milk filters collected from the milk pipe at the point where it enters the milk bulk tank at the farms and this way of sampling was compared to sampling bulk tank milk (BTM) directly. Analysing milk filters were found to be superior to analysing BTM directly. Conditions for transport of milk filter samples were further improved by the addition of Cary Blair transport medium, which significantly increased the number of positive samples for pathogenic bacteria. The isolation of several foodborne pathogens from milk filters was demonstrated. The prevalence of samples with Staphylococcus aureus was 71% and 64%, and Listeria spp. 21% and 29% from dairy cow and goat/sheep farms, respectively. Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) O157 were detected in 9%, 2% and 2% of samples from bovine milk, respectively. We conclude that the choice of sampling method and sample handling influence the results of bacterial culturing. From the results of this study, we strongly recommend to sample in-line milk filters instead of BTM directly and to use Cary Blair medium during transport, especially if the samples are to be analysed for Campylobacter spp. and/or Listeria spp. The findings also show that unpasteurized milk from Swedish farms occasionally contain bacteria with zoonotic potential."

Results showed that lead consumption varies from region to region, with some, such as Heibei, being at higher risk and consuming larger amounts, and others, such as Shanxi, being at lower risk. It was found that the spatial correlation between lead intake from meats and vegetables was 0.545. The strong association between meats and vegetables shows that lead contamination has a large effect on fresh foods. The food groups with the highest contribution to lead intake were cereals and vegetables, while the food categories with the lowest contribution were dairy products, sugar, and alcohol. The main food group contributing to lead intake in different regions was found to be cereals in Hebei, vegetables in Heilongjiang and Ningxia, and meats in Sichuan and Hunan.

AimThis observational retrospective study aimed to provide an overview of Q fever incidence in Bulgaria in the period 2011 to 2017. MethodsAggregated surveillance data from Bulgaria's mandatory surveillance system, laboratory data on individual samples received at the National Reference Laboratory Rickettsiae and Cell Cultures and outbreak reports sent by the regional health authorities to the National Centre of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, were used in this analysis. Cases were described by year, region, age group and most commonly identified risk behaviours. ResultsA total of 139 confirmed cases were reported in the study period (average annual incidence: 0.27 cases/100,000 inhabitants). No seasonality or trend in reported cases was observed. Cases were mostly sporadic, with two small outbreaks in 2017. Identified risk behaviours among cases were occupational exposure and consumption of milk and dairy products, although exposure data were incomplete. The male/female ratio was 1.4. The identification and resolution of the two rural outbreaks in 2017 with a total of 18 cases involved good practices: active case finding and collaboration between public health and veterinary authorities. ConclusionBetween 2011 and 2017, Bulgaria retained low Q fever incidence, mostly sporadic cases and two small outbreaks. Occupational exposure and consumption of milk and dairy products were the most often reported likely exposures among cases. The outbreak investigations demonstrate the application of good control practices."

We aimed to assess the association between iodine status during pregnancy and the cognitive and motor development of children at 4-5 years. METHODS:We conducted a prospective cohort study in four Spanish regions with recruitment of pregnant women between 2003 and 2008 and follow-up of their children up to 4-5 years (mean (SD)=4.8 (0.6)). Cognitive and motor function was assessed in 1803 children using the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Dietary iodine and supplementation were measured through questionnaires twice during pregnancy. Urinary iodine concentration (UIC) was measured in spot samples. The residuals of a regression of UIC against creatinine were used to define a variable corrected for creatinine (UIC~Cr). RESULTS:Neither iodine supplements nor iodised salt consumption or maternal UIC were associated with cognitive or motor function. After adjusting for creatinine, children of women with UIC~Cr <100 µg/L had 3.93 (95% CI -6.18 to -1.69) general cognitive scores lower than the reference (150-249 µg/L). Dietary iodine was inversely associated with motor scores and milk but not other dairy products or seafood consumption accounted for this association (beta: -1.36; 95% CI -2.12 to -0.61; per one daily milk serving). CONCLUSIONS:We found an association between low maternal urinary iodine and lower cognitive scores in childhood, although only when corrected for creatinine, adding to the evidence that iodine deficiency may have potential harmful effects on neurodevelopment. Iodine supplementation does not appear to improve child's neurodevelopment at 4-5 years."

This research provides an insight into the variety of viable molds (i. e. , filamentous microfungi) that can be isolated from hay produced in South Italy and destined to dairy cows. On different lots of hay (n = 55) collected from 20 dairy farms, a total of 33 different fungal species were identified. The most representative was Cladosporium cladosporioides (n = 46, 84%) followed by Alternaria alternata (n = 25, 45%), and Rhizopus stolonifer (n = 24, 44%). The species most closely related to aflatoxin (AF) contamination, Aspergillus flavus, was often isolated (n = 11, 20%). Regarding AF detection, all the hay samples were found to be scarcely contaminated by AFB1 and showed values from 0.0020 to 0.0077 mg/kg, below the limits established by European Union (EU legislation) (0.02 mg/kg). None of the samples were positive for Aspergillia and tested for AFB1 showed results exceeding established limits. Additionally, hay with moisture between 15.0 and 19.2% or crude ash on dry matter content ranging from 14.0 to 15.5% reported an increased presence of AFB1 (p < 0.05) compared to the other samples. All the analyzed hay samples, besides the presence of molds, can be considered safe for the presence of AFB1.

Additionally the effect of the skimming process on TCs concentrations was tested, as well as the influence of low-temperature long-time pasteurisation. The analyses of TCs in milk and dairy products were performed by an LC-MS/MS method. In order to determine TCs residues in dairy products, an analytical method was developed with the same extraction step for all matrices. TCs molecules were inhomogenously distributed between the milk derivative fractions. The highest concentrations were determined in curd and cheese in the ranges 320-482 µg/kg and 280-561 µg/kg, respectively. Low levels of TCs in butter and whey were observed (11.8-41.2 µg/kg). TCs were found in sour milk (66.0-111 µg/kg), cream (85.0-115 µg/kg) and buttermilk (196-221 µg/kg) at much higher levels than in butter and whey, but lower than in curd and cheese. During the skimming process, the highest yield of cream was obtained after the raw milk was held at 2-8°C for 24 h. The differences in concentrations of TCs between whole milk and skimmed milk, expressed as percentages of recovery, were below 19% (recoveries in excess of 81%). The highest content was observed in milk and cream skimmed at 2-8°C. The degradation percentages for TCs during the pasteurisation process (63°C for 30 min) were below 19%."

To date, the various modes of transmission of the virus have not been fully elucidated. In this regard, there is a possibility of transmission of the virus through food products. The COVID-19 pandemic disease, like those associated with SARS and MERS, is transmitted mainly through the respiratory tract and airborne aerosol particles, but the presence of fragments of the genetic virus (RNA) in the feces of numerous patients proposes that their fecal-oral pathway may be expanded. In addition, people with gastrointestinal disorders such as atrophic gastritis and metaplasia may be susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Accordingly, food may act as a potential carrier of COVID-19 due to environmental or cross-contamination. According to the available evidence, the spread and possibility of transmission of COVID-19 contamination from humans to food products are possible. Beyond that, there is some evidence that some food sources of animal origin, such as pigs and rabbits, can be contaminated by COVID-19. Therefore, the transmission of the virus through some meat products may be conceivable. Due to the rapid release rate of COVID-19 and its stability in various milieus, especially food manufacturing circumstances, it may enter the matrix during different stages of traditional or industrial food processing. Therefore, preventive measures are recommended to be utilized in the food manufacturing sector. The present study explored the risk of different food matrices, including dairy products, bread, meat and meat products, vegetables, fruits, and processed foods, as potential carriers for the transmission of COVID-19."

BCRP is also highly expressed in lactating mammary glands in mice, and this expression is conserved in cows and humans. As a result, BCRP substrates can be secreted into milk. We investigated whether different classes of dietary carcinogens are substrates of Bcrp1/BCRP and the implications for systemic exposure and breast milk contamination. Using polarized cell lines, we found that Bcrp1 transports the heterocyclic amines 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) and the potent human hepatocarcinogen aflatoxin B1, and decreases their cellular accumulation up to 10-fold. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies showed that [14C]IQ, [14C]Trp-P-1 and [3H]aflatoxin B1 plasma levels were substantially lower in wild-type compared with Bcrp1-/- mice, after both oral and intravenous administration, demonstrating that Bcrp1 restricts systemic exposure to these carcinogens. Moreover, Bcrp1 mediates transfer of [14C]IQ, [14C]Trp-P-1 and [3H]aflatoxin into milk, with 3.4+/-0.6, 2.6+/-0.3 and 3.8+/-0.5-fold higher milk to plasma ratios, respectively, in lactating wild-type versus Bcrp1-/- mice. We have thus identified Bcrp1/BCRP as one of the molecular mechanisms by which heterocyclic amines and aflatoxin are transferred into milk, thereby posing a health risk to breast-fed infants and dairy consumers. Paradoxically, Bcrp1/BCRP appears to have both protective and adverse roles with respect to exposure to dietary carcinogens."

The high-As groundwaters are from Quaternary deposits of loess (mainly silt) with intermixed rhyolitic or dacitic volcanic ash (Nicolli et al. 1989, Smedley et al. 1998,2002). Early in the last century an endemic disease due to contamination of drinking water with arsenic was recognised. This disease is called HACRE (Hidroarsenicismo Crónico Regional Endémico, Chronic Endemic Regional Hydroarsenism) and is connected with a particular type of skin cancer (Astolfi et al. 1981). One of the most affected region is the province of Cordoba, where Nicolli et al. (1989) reported As concentrations that exceed the maximun level permitted for drinking water of 50 microg/l for 82% of the groundwater samples (n=60) of a study area comprising approximately 10000 km2. The southeast of Cordoba is an important milk production zone in Argentina, where dairy product consumption is up to 192 equivalent milk l/inhabitant/year. As a secretion of the mammary gland, milk can carry numerous xenobiotic substances, which constitute a technological risk factor for dairy products and above all for the health of the consumer (Licata et al. 2004). Nevertheless no studies on the incidence of high-As livestock drinking water in livestock health and its transfer to milk have been performed in Argentina. The aim of the present study was the determination of arsenic content in livestock drinking water and milk from dairy farms located in an area of high-As groundwaters, to analyse the relation between As uptake through water and its transfer to milk."

We detected resistance to tetracycline in 68.4% of C. jejuni isolates, and resistance to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid in 13.2% of C. jejuni isolates. Based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, we found that dairy-associated C. jejuni were genotypically diverse, although clonal strains were isolated from different geographic regions.

Because foodstuffs of animal origin are well known to be prominent contributors to these contaminants, the current study aimed to assess the role of the dietary intake of animal products as a probability factor for increased serum POPs. The intake of animal products (dietary variables) as a determining factor for serum POP levels was investigated using multivariate statistical models. Our results showed that while poultry, rabbit, and cheese consumption increases the probability of having high levels of non-DDT-derivative pesticides, sausage, yogurt, lard, and bacon consumption decreases the probability of having high levels of these pesticides. In addition, poultry, rabbit, eggs, cream, and butter consumption increased the probability of having detectable levels of marker PCB, while dairy desserts decreased the probability of having detectable levels of these PCBs. On the contrary, sausage and meat consumption increased the probability of having detectable levels of dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs). The current results confirm that dietary intake of foodstuffs of animal origin is a relevant risk factor for the accumulation of POPs (and therefore their serum levels). Our study indicates that the analysis of dietary patterns may be useful for identifying those individuals that will probably present a high body burden of POPs. Because POPs can exert deleterious effects on human health, the identification of populations at risk of being highly contaminated is mandatory in order to implement policies that minimize the exposure to these compounds."

Results of a questionnaire supplied to veterinarians and telephone interviews with meat packer representatives were analyzed by use of univariate and multivariate logistic regression procedures. Some meat packers considered the quality of incoming cull dairy cattle as a control point for food safety hazards. More than 50% of dairy and government-employed veterinarians believed that a current market for on-farm food safety services exists; > 85% believed that a potential market exists.

The results of the search for Yersinia enterocolitica in food samples taken in Umbria region (central Italy) were evaluated during the years 2015-2018. Different types of foods were considered, both ready-to-eat (meat products, dairy products, and raw vegetables) and meat preparations to be eaten after cooking. Samples were assayed by molecular screening for the species indicator gene ompF. Screening positives were subjected to isolation and characterization by searching for specific virulence marker genes, including the ail gene responsible for invasiveness and the ystB gene for the production of enterotoxin. The total prevalence of positive samples for Yersinia enterocolitica was 16.86% with a higher percentage of positive samples in meat preparations (19.35%), followed by ready-to-eat vegetables (11.76%). Poultry meat samples had a higher prevalence than pork and beef samples. Neither positive samples were found in meat products and dairy, nor seasonality in positivity was observed. All isolated strains of Yersinia enterocolitica were biotype 1A, with absence of the ail virulence gene but presence of ystB gene. Since the strains isolated from human patients appear to be primarily biotypes that possess the ail marker, future investigations would be needed regarding the real role of biotype 1A in human disease. In this context, attention should certainly be paid to ready-to-eat vegetables and to careful cooking of meat preparations."

Since this transporter has been extensively related to the active secretion of drugs into milk, the potential in vivo effect of this polymorphism on secretion of xenobiotics in livestock could have striking consequences for milk production, the dairy industry, and public health. Our purpose was to study the in vivo effect of this polymorphism on the secretion of danofloxacin, a widely used veterinary antibiotic, into milk. Danofloxacin (1.25 mg/kg) was administered to six Y/Y 581 homozygous and six Y/S 581 heterozygous lactating cows, and plasma and milk samples were collected and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. No differences were found in the pharmacokinetic parameters of danofloxacin in plasma between the two groups of animals. In contrast, Y/S heterozygous cows showed a 2-fold increase in danofloxacin levels in milk. In addition, the pharmacokinetic elimination parameters, mean residence time and elimination half-life, were significantly lower in the milk of the animals carrying the Y/S polymorphism. These in vivo results are in agreement with our previously published in vitro data, which showed a greater capacity of the S581 variant in accumulation assays, and demonstrate, for the first time, an important effect of the Y581S single-nucleotide polymorphism on antibiotic secretion into cow milk. These findings could be extended to other ABCG2 substrates, and may be relevant for the treatment of mastitis and for the design of accurate and novel strategies to handle milk residues."

In the last decade, several critical reviews and meta-analysis concerning organic food consumption and their effect on some chosen health problems have been published. The aim of the work was to present the current state of knowledge regarding the influence of organic food consumption on human health. On average, organic food of plant origin is characterized by a trace presence of pesticides, a lower content of nitrates and an increased content of polyphenols and vitamin C. Organic products of animal origin contain more beneficial for health unsaturated fatty acid. Organic dairy products, in contrast to meat products, are characterized by a higher content of protein and saturated fatty acids, however, the differences more result from the length of the grazing period and access to fresh forage than to the production system. Although generally, the consumption of organic food does not provide a significant nutritional advantage compared to a conventional diet, regular and frequent consumption of organic products generally reduces the risk of overweight and obesity, both for women and men, as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma in case of women. Besides those, consumption of organic fruits and vegetables, as well as dairy products significantly reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia in pregnancy and eczema in infants, respectively. Positive effect on selected health problems probably results from a reduced amount of pesticide residues and an increased secondary plant metabolites intake which characterize organic food. This review showed that there is a need for further, especially, large cohort studies concerning the effect of organic food consumption on specific diseases development."

Thus, dairy industry focuses most of their processes and costs on keeping contamination levels as low as possible. Thermal processes for microbial decontamination may be effective; however, they cannot provide excellent organoleptic, nutritional, and decontamination properties simultaneously. In this scenario, microbial inactivation by exposure to blue light is a promising alternative method in the food industry due to its intrinsic antimicrobial properties free of any thermal effect. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the inactivation kinetics induced by blue light (λ = 413 nm) against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Mycobacterium fortuitum cells suspended in whole milk or saline solution. We also performed a series of optic spectroscopies to investigate possible degradation of milk components. All species were sensitive to photoinactivation suspended either in saline solution or milk. Inactivation kinetics differs significantly depending on the suspension medium and each species is differently affected. All bacterial species tested presented more than 5 log10 of inactivation within less than 2 h of irradiation (720 J/cm2). Infrared spectroscopy did not reveal any significant alteration in any of the milk constituents (e. g. , sugars, proteins, and lipids).

Cysts were detected in 41% of runoff samples collected near cattle less than 2 months old, compared to 10% of runoff samples collected near cattle over 6 months old. Furthermore, the concentrations and instantaneous loads of cysts were > or =65 and > or =79 times greater, respectively, in runoff from sites housing young calves than in sites housing other age classes of animals. Factors associated with environmental loading of G. duodenalis included cattle age, cattle stocking number, and precipitation but not lot area, land slope, or cattle density. Vegetated buffer strips were found to significantly reduce waterborne cysts in storm runoff: each additional meter of vegetated buffer placed below high-cattle-use areas was associated with reductions in the concentration and instantaneous load of cysts by factors of 0.86 and 0.79 (-0.07 and -0.10 log(10)/m), respectively. Straw mulch, seed application, scraping of manure, and cattle exclusion did not significantly affect the concentration or load of G. duodenalis cysts. The study findings suggest that vegetated buffer strips, especially when placed near dairy calf areas, should help reduce the environmental loading of these fecal protozoa discharging from dairy farms."

The current study utilized concentration data from different sources representing international studies performed over the past decade to determine those food products that contribute the most exposure to PAHs through ingestion for the Azeri population. Due to lack of concentration data from middle-Eastern countries, only European countries were considered and used for this analysis. Using the benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) toxicity equivalency factors (TEFs) to adjust the concentrations of the individual PAH compounds to BaP equivalent concentrations, risk analyses were performed. Deterministic risk estimates fell within probabilistic risk estimates. Child risks were consistently four to seven times higher in magnitude than adult risks. Risk potentials determined for the food exposure pathway were also determined to be up to ten times higher in magnitude than risks determined from exposures due to other pathways such as soil contamination. It was observed that three major factors contributed to the variability in the assessment results, which were child and adult body weights, consumption rates of the different food groups, and the variances of the input data. The most prevalent pathways of PAH exposure from the dietary patterns of the Azerbaijani population were determined to be from bread and bakery products, milk and dairy products, and egg products."

A large number of STEC strains (e. g. , members of the serogroups O26, O91, O103, O111, O118, O145, and O166) have caused major outbreaks and sporadic cases of human illnesses that have ranged from mild diarrhea to the life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome. These illnesses were traced to O157 and non-O157 STEC. In most cases, STEC infection was attributed to consumption of ground beef or dairy products that were contaminated with cattle feces. Thus, dairy cattle are considered reservoirs of STEC and can impose a significant health risk to humans. The global nature of food supply suggests that safety concerns with beef and dairy foods will continue and the challenges facing the dairy industry will increase at the production and processing levels. In this review, published reports on STEC in dairy cattle and their products were evaluated to achieve the following specific objectives: 1) to assemble a database on human infections with STEC from dairy cattle, 2) to assess prevalence of STEC in dairy cattle, and 3) to determine the health risks associated with STEC strains from dairy cattle. The latter objective is critically important, as many dairy STEC isolates are known to be of high virulence. Fecal testing of dairy cattle worldwide showed wide ranges of prevalence rates for O157 (0.2 to 48.8%) and non-O157 STEC (0.4 to 74.0%). Of the 193 STEC serotypes of dairy cattle origin, 24 have been isolated from patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome. Such risks emphasize the importance and the need to develop long-term strategies to assure safety of foods from dairy cattle."

Forty late healthy lactating Holstein cows (270 ± 22 d in milk; daily milk yield 21 ± 3.1 kg/d) were randomly assigned to four treatments: control diet without AFB1 and adsorbents (CON), CON with 8 μg/kg AFB1 (dry matter basis, AF), AF + 15 g/d adsorbent 1 (AD1), AF + 15 g/d adsorbent 2 (AD2). The experiment lasted for 19 days, including an AFB1-challenge phase (day 1 to 14) and an AFB1-withdraw phase (day 15 to 19). Results showed that both AFB1 and adsorbents treatments had no significant effects on the DMI, milk yield, 3.5% FCM yield, milk components and serum parameters. Compared with the AF, AD1 and AD2 had significantly lower milk AFM1 concentrations (93 ng/L vs. 46 ng/L vs. 51 ng/L) and transfer rates of dietary AFB1 into milk AFM1 (1.16% vs. 0.57% vs. 0.63%) (p < 0.05). Children aged 2-4 years old had the highest exposure risk to AFM1 in milk in AF, with an EDI of 1.02 ng/kg bw/day and a HI of 5.11 (HI > 1 indicates a potential risk for liver cancer). Both AD1 and AD2 had obviously reductions in EDI and HI for all population groups, whereas, the EDI (≥0.25 ng/kg bw/day) and HI (≥1.23) of children aged 2-11 years old were still higher than the suggested tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.20 ng/kg bw/day and 1.00 (HI). In conclusion, moderate risk level AFB1 in the diet of healthy lactating cows could cause a public health hazard and adding adsorbents in the dairy diet is an effective measure to remit AFM1 residue in milk and its exposure risk for humans."

The outbreak was caused by feeding grass silage, which was contaminated with 5 log10 CFU L. monocytogenes/g. Clinically, although having been fed from the same batch of silage, abortive (nine ewes), encephalitic (one ewe) and septicaemic (four ewes) forms of listeriosis were observed during the outbreak phase. As the starting point of feeding the contaminated silage was known we could calculate an incubation period of 18+/-2 and 26 days for the abortive and the encephalitic form of listeriosis, respectively. Pathologically, the septicaemic cases suffered from Listeria accumulation at comparable numbers in visceral organs but not in the brain. Only a single ewe developed central nervous symptoms and a rhomb-encephalitis was immunohistologically confirmed. In this case the infection proceeded from the nasal mucosa into the brain, with no infections of the liver, spleen and other visceral organs. Sampling of the cheese production chain, the farm environment and the persons living at the farm revealed the exposure of a farm-worker to an isolate genetically indistinguishable from the outbreak clone, obviously through the consumption of faecally contaminated bovine raw milk. The cheese under processing was free of Listeria because, as a result of intensive consultations, the farmer ensured a proper acidification of the cheese.

Owing to their chronic toxic effects in humans and bioaccumulative properties, their presence in feed and food requires particular attention. One important exposure pathway for consumers is consumption of milk and dairy products. Their transfer from feed to milk has been studied for the past 50 years to quantify the uptake and elimination kinetics. We extracted transfer parameters (transfer rate, transfer factor, biotransfer factor and elimination half-lives) in a machine-readable format from seventy-six primary and twenty-nine secondary literature items. Kinetic data for some toxicologically relevant dioxin congeners and the elimination half-lives of dioxin-like PCBs are still not available. A well-defined selection of transfer parameters from literature was statistically analysed and shown to display high variability. To understand this variability, we discuss the data with an emphasis on influencing factors, such as experimental conditions, cow performance parameters and metabolic state. While no universal interpretation could be derived, a tendency for increased transfer into milk is apparently connected to an increase in milk yield and milk fat yield as well as during times of body fat mobilisation, for example during the negative energy balance after calving. Over the past decades, milk yield has increased to over 40 kg/d during high lactation, so more research is needed on how this impacts feed to food transfer for PCDD/Fs and PCBs."

The leakage of BFRs from consumer products leads to exposure of humans from fetal life to adulthood.

House dust is also reported as an important source of exposure for children as well as adults. The levels of BFRs in the general North American populations are higher than those in Europe and Japan and the highest levels are detected in infants and toddlers. The daily intake via breast milk exceeds the RfD in 10% of US infants. BFRs including PBDEs, HBCDs and TBBP-A have induced endocrine-, reproductive- and behavior effects in laboratory animals. Furthermore, recent human epidemiological data demonstrated association between exposure to BFRs and similar adverse effects as observed in animal studies. Fish including farmed fish and crude fish oil for human consumption may contain substantial levels of BFRs and infants and toddlers consuming these products on a daily basis may exceed the tolerable daily intake suggesting that fish and fish oil alone represent a risk to human health. This intake comes in addition to exposure from other sources (breast milk, other food, house dust). Because potential harmful concentrations of BFRs and other toxicants occur in fish and fish products, research on a wider range of products is warranted, to assess health hazard related to the contamination of fish and fish products for human consumption."

Yet there is little information that compares the practical performance of these two assays.

A total of 1,920 concomitant analyses were conducted with main variables of assay type, processing facility type, and hygiene zone category. Statistical process control methodology was used to calculate 95% confidence control limits; data beyond those limits were considered contamination events. Results demonstrated that overall, the AXP assay detected contamination events approximately two times more often than the assay based on ATP only. This increase in the rate of contamination event detection was especially prevalent in the meat processing facility, where across all hygienic zones, there were 38 versus 85 contaminations events detected for the ATP and AXP assays, respectively. Across hygiene zones, the AXP data displayed either an equal or an increased incidence of soil detection compared with data from the ATP assay.

In each group, significant (p<0.05) differences in motility were observed. The transcript levels of nine cold stress-related genes were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR in two representatives of persistent (CBISA3077) and sporadic (CBISA3049) strains isolated from the dairy environment, and significant (p<0.05) differences between the two strains were observed. The persistent strain showed significantly higher transcript levels of dtpT and sigB genes, and significantly lower levels of flaA, oppA, lmo1722, and lmo0866 genes. In the persistent strain, the upregulation of sigB, involved in the tolerance to low temperature and to osmotic stress, could account for the persistence of this strain in its original dairy environment. In a similar way, the downregulation of two helicase-encoding genes lmo1722 and lmo0866, in this strain, may be an evolutionary trait that could facilitate cold stress adaptation. Even though this analysis should be extended to more sporadic and more persistent strains, the results presented here strongly suggest gene expression networks differently adjusted, in the two strains, to the low-temperature environment from where they were collected.

Efforts by regulatory authorities to control nitrofurazone from agricultural foods are an important public health measure that have, to some extent, been undermined by widespread use amongst laboratories of the unreliable marker metabolite semicarbazide. This work confirms what has long been suspected, namely that powdered dairy products that are initially free of semicarbazide develop semicarbazide under storage conditions such as occur normally across commercial supply chains. The low ng g(-)(1) levels of semicarbazide formed in this way are insufficient to present any food safety hazard. That such development of a marker metabolite is demonstrated to occur by innocent means effectively invalidates the use of semicarbazide as a marker metabolite for powdered dairy products, and exacerbates the regulatory need for a more suitable analytical methodology. In milk, unlike meat, nitrofurazone is known to remain stable and thus available for analysis in the intact form, rather than necessitating any use of a metabolite or fragment. However, no previous methodology that was capable of achieving the stringent European minimum required performance limit of 1 ng g(-)(1) when using intact nitrofurazone had been described for milk. This work describes a specific methodology using LC-MS/MS for milk and milk powder; it achieves detection of intact nitrofurazone (as well as furazolidone, furaltadone and nitrofurantoin) to levels well below 1 ng g(-)(1).

The residues of these agro-chemicals, if not managed properly, could leak into the environment, affecting natural processes, biodiversity, and soil life. Public health can also be affected due to residues in milk and meat, especially in countries with insufficient food quality controls. These processes contribute to the growing global threat to human and animal health posed by multi-resistant microbes. This article discusses the differences and similarities of dairy farming, and the effect on public and environmental health, between the Netherlands, India, Ethiopia, and Uganda, emphasizing the strategies that have been developed during the E-Motive exchange project to reduce the use of antibiotics and other chemicals in dairy farming. Proposed solutions include raising consciousness about the risk of antibiotics and their effect on food quality, and implementing the Natural Livestock Farming five-layer approach for reducing the use of antibiotics and other chemicals. This approach is based on improving animal and farm management, revitalizing ethno veterinary knowledge and the use of medicinal plants, genetic improvement through strategic use of local breeds, establishing quality control systems in the dairy chain, and extra payment to farmers for residue-free milk."

Forty-three samples of raw, whole, refrigerated bulk-tank milk samples (22 of ewe milk and 21 of goat milk) were analyzed during the whole lactation period. Four concentrations of 4 antibiotics were diluted in milk: penicillin G at 1, 2, 3, and 4 μg/L; sulfadiazine at 25, 50, 100, and 200 μg/L; tetracycline at 50, 100, 200, and 400 μg/L; and gentamicin at 25, 50, 100, and 200 μg/L. The detection limit of the Delvotest Accelerator was calculated as the range of antibiotic concentrations within which 95% of positive result lie. The range of detection limit of penicillin G and sulfadiazine was easily detected by Delvotest Accelerator at or below the European Union maximum residue limits, both for ewe and goat milk samples. In contrast, the system showed a lower ability to detect tetracycline and gentamicin both for ewe and goat milk samples. Very low percentages of false-positive outcomes were obtained. Lactation phase did not seem to be a crucial factor affecting the ability of the Delvotest Accelerator to detect spiked milk samples. A higher detection ability was observed for goat milk samples compared with ewe milk samples. A negative correlation between the percentage of positive milk samples detected and milk fat, protein, and lactose contents was observed for gentamicin only."

Effective control or inhibition of E. coli O157:H7 growth depends on our understanding of mechanisms that regulate its growth at low temperature. We hypothesized that polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) plays a critical role in E. coli O157:H7 low-temperature growth. To test this hypothesis, the pnp deletion mutant of E. coli O157:H7 was generated using the λ Red recombinase system, and the growth and survival of wild-type and pnp deletion mutant strains were compared at low temperatures. The growth of pnp deletion mutant strains in Luria Broth (LB) and agar plate at 37°C was similar to their corresponding wild-type strains, while the deletion of pnp impaired E. coli O157:H7 growth in LB at 10°C and 22°C; growth impairment could be partially recovered in the mutant strains by ectopic expression of the pnp complementation plasmid, demonstrating that growth impairment was PNPase-specific. During 14 days of 10°C storage in both LB and milk, wild type strain EDL933 grew and reached >8 log10 colony-forming units per milliliter after 4 days of 10°C storage, while EDL933Δpnp gradually died off with effects more pronounced in milk, which were again mitigated by pnp overexpression. In addition, pnp deletion impaired the motility of E. coli O157:H7 but did not affect its susceptibility to H2O2. PNPase is required for the growth of E. coli O157:H7 at low temperature; PNPase thus provides a molecular target to control the growth of E. coli O157:H7, which may have important practical applications in dairy and other food industry."

The prevalence of multidrug-resistant, particularly methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), has steadily increased in several European countries. In this study, the prevalence of S. aureus in raw cow milk and farm workers was investigated, and the trajectories of MRSA transmission at the primary stage of the dairy chain were assessed. To this purpose, a longitudinal survey was conducted in 618 dairy farms in two contiguous regions with high livestock density in North-eastern Italy. S. aureus contamination of bulk tank milk (BTM) was observed in more than 80% of farms, while MRSA prevalence was 3.6% and 15.9% in BTM and farm workers, respectively. The majority of MRSA isolates from both BTM and farm workers were assigned to ST398, and showed a worrisome multidrug-resistant phenotype. Enterotoxin and Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes were detected in 11.5% and 4.9% of MRSA isolates from both sources. Nearly all MRSA isolates from workers belonged to the same epidemiological type as BTM isolates from the corresponding farm, denoting a bidirectional MRSA transmission pattern. A focus on the ST398 spa type t899 MRSA lineage in the Italian livestock system highlighted the presence of two major clusters whose dissemination was likely facilitated by the selective pressure imposed by antimicrobial use in animal farming. Our findings emphasize the need for continuous monitoring of MRSA along the dairy production chain, not only to avoid transmission between animals and exposed workers, but also to contain the risk of raw milk and dairy product contamination by multidrug resistant and toxigenic strain."

This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of MRSA, discriminatory geno-analysis and antibiotic resistance scheme of the strains isolated from bovine subclinical mastitis in Kurdistan province of Iran. A total of 283 samples were collected and analyzed for S. aureus phenotypically and molecularly. SCCmec and coa types, and pvl gene were evaluated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Finally, the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns of coa types and the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the isolates were assessed. Among the 95 isolates of S. aureus, 11 (11.57%) strains were recognized as MRSA. Six, one, and four SCCmec types represented for IVa, IVc, and V were determined, respectively, among which an individual IVa and V determinant harboured pvl gene. Restriction digestion products of 490 bp, 680 bp, and 730 bp of coa bands were generated. Tobramycin, mupirocin, fusidic acid, clindamycin, and chloramphenicol were the most effective drugs against the MRSA isolates. The detrimental involvement of S. aureus in bovine subclinical mastitis is proved herein. Besides, the contribution of MRSA and potential contamination of milk and dairy products with the bacterium may impose a serious public health risk.

Also, mislabeling or adulteration of expensive milk samples, like ewe or goat milk, with cow's milk is a growing problem in the dairy market. Thus, the determination of the authenticity of milk samples has crucial importance for both producers and consumers. The aim of this study was to discriminate milk samples using Raman spectroscopy with partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), first with regard to whether the milk was heat-treated or not, and second with regard to species (cow, goat, ewe, mixture (adulterated)) in both raw and pasteurized milk. First, discrimination of milk samples as raw or pasteurized was achieved using PLS-DA. Both in calibration and prediction models, high sensitivity and specificity values were obtained for raw and pasteurized milk samples. Second, the proposed method also discriminated milk samples according to their species (cow, goat, ewe, and mixture) for both raw and pasteurized milk. In both calibration and prediction models, the sensitivity and specificity values were above 0.857 and 0.897 respectively. Also, the accuracy values were above 0.915. The results obtained denote satisfactory accurate classification of the samples. The results suggest that Raman spectroscopy coupled with PLS-DA can be successfully used to discriminate milk samples according to heat treatment (raw/pasteurized) and their species within 20 s per sample.

Emission estimates are combined with a country-specific set of indicators to assess the environmental impact in nine regions with specific environmental characteristics. We estimate the contribution of emissions of ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen oxides (NO) to acidification and terrestrial eutrophication, nitrate (NO3) and phosphate (PO4) to aquatic eutrophication, nitrogen oxides (NO), particulate matter (PM10) and (PM2.5) to human toxicity and methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (NO) to global warming. We present large regional differences in the environmental and health impact per unit of agricultural production. The regional acidifying, eutrophying and global warming impact of dairy cattle is calculated to be up to three times the national average, depending on the dairy cattle intensity. Aquatic eutrophication is found to be a problem in regions with relatively high eutrophying emissions per hectare of so-called nitrate vulnerable zones. Human toxicity problems caused by dairy cattle livestock and manure management are problematic in regions with a high population density in rural areas. The strength of our approach is the use of country-specific characterisation factors to assess the potential environmental and health impact of agriculture at the sub-national scale.

Animal welfare and residues of the antibiotics used to treat mastitis cause public concern. Considerable genetic variation may allow selection for increased resistance to mastitis. Because of high genetic correlation to milk somatic cell score (SCS), SCS can serve as a surrogate trait for mastitis resistance. The present study intended to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting SCS in Israeli and Italian Holstein dairy cattle (IsH and ItH, respectively), using selective DNA pooling with single and multiple marker mapping. Milk samples of 4,788 daughters of 6 IsH and 7 ItH sires were used to construct sire-family high- and low-tail pools, which were genotyped at 123 (IsH) and 133 (ItH) microsatellite markers. Shadow correction was used to obtain pool allele frequency estimates. Frequency difference between the tails and empirical standard error of D, SE(D), were used to obtain P-values. All markers significant by single marker mapping were also significant by multiple marker mapping, but not vice versa. Combining both populations, 22 QTL on 21 chromosomes were identified; all corresponded to previous reports in the literature. Confidence intervals were set by chi-squared drop method. Heterozygosity of QTL was estimated at 44.2%. Allele substitution effects ranged from 1,782 to 4,930 cells/mL in estimated breeding value somatic cell count units. Most (80%) of the observed variation in estimated breeding value somatic cell score could be explained by the QTL identified under the stringent criteria. The results found here can be used as a basis for further genome-wide association studies for the same trait."

Due to low-temperature sterilization for a short period of time, pasteurization is not sufficient for complete elimination of B. cereus in milk, thereby cause severe economic loss and food safety problems. It is therefore of paramount importance to perform risk assessment of B. cereus in pasteurized milk. In this study, we isolated B. cereus from pasteurized milk samples in different regions of China, and evaluated the contamination situation, existence of virulence genes, antibiotic resistance profile and genetic polymorphism of B. cereus isolates. Intriguingly, 70 samples (27%) were found to be contaminated by B. cereus and the average contamination level was 111 MPN/g. The distribution of virulence genes was assessed toward 10 enterotoxigenic genes (hblA, hblC, hblD, nheA, nheB, nheC, cytK, entFM, bceT, and hlyII) and one emetic gene (cesB). Forty five percent strains harbored enterotoxigenic genes hblACD and 93% isolates contained nheABC gene cluster. The positive rate of cytK, entFM, bceT, hlyII, and cesB genes were 73, 96, 75, 54, and 5%, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility assessment showed that most of the isolates were resistant to β-lactam antibiotics and rifampicin, but susceptible to other antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol. Total multidrug-resistant population was about 34%. In addition, B. cereus isolates in pasteurized milk showed a high genetic diversity. In conclusion, our findings provide the first reference on the prevalence, contamination level and characteristics of B. cereus isolated from pasteurized milk in China, suggesting a potential high risk of B. cereus to public health and dairy industry."

Superantigens, such as enterotoxins contribute to S. aureus persistence and pathogenicity in this disease. Subclinical and chronic mastitis cases were diagnosed and S. aureus isolates from sub-clinical cases were investigated for carriage of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes that may contribute to long-term carriage and infection. Over a 12-month period, 116 S. aureus strains were recovered from 68 cows with subclinical mastitis. Classical enterotoxin genes (sea-see) were detected in 24.1% of isolates, and pvl and tsst-1 were identified in 3.4% and 46.6% the isolates, respectively. 18.1% that were persistent isolates were identified and characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), MLST, spa typing. Four isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and belonged to SCCmec type I. Molecular typing showed that the agrI group was the most frequent, and a rare isolate was positive for both agrI and agrIII groups. Molecular characterization revealed the persistence of the spa type t10856 (ST133, clonal complex CC133, agr I), in a single animal for nine months and the persistence t605 (ST126, CC126) colonizing four animals for four months. These strains have been described recently in other herds in the same region, indicating their transmissibility and clonal expansion. We conclude that animals with subclinical mastitis are an important and somewhat overlooked reservoir for transmission within and between herds, and may carry virulence and antibiotic resistance genes contributing to persistent colonization, hinder the control of mastitis and may cause risks to the public health."

We collected nasal swab samples from 17 Danish veal farms, 2 slaughterhouses, and received bulk tank milk samples from 286 dairy farms. All samples were analyzed by culturing and screening on MRSA selective plates and presumed MRSA was verified by MALDI-TOF and PCR. MRSA isolates were subjected to spa typing and whole-genome sequencing. LA-MRSA was found on two veal farms in one and three calves, respectively, with subsequent follow-up samples found negative. Eight of 286 dairy farms (2.8%) were found LA-MRSA positive and follow-up samples, from five farms showed intermittent detection of LA-MRSA. The spa types, t034 and t011, were the most common while a single isolate from a dairy farm belonged to spa type t843 associated to mecC-MRSA CC130 and is the first report of mecC-MRSA in the Danish dairy production. A phylogenetic analysis showed that some of the isolates grouped within or close to the dominant Danish pig clusters, suggesting spillover into cattle farms. Other isolates clustered outside the dominant pig clusters suggesting that other routes of introduction cannot be excluded. Results of the investigation indicated a contamination of veal farms while some dairy farms seemed to be a permanent reservoir.

The sustainability of these systems is determined by a multitude of interacting economic, social and environmental factors. Dairy production presents a relevant example of the sustainability trade-offs that occur within such systems. On the one hand, dairy production constitutes an important part of the human diet, but it is also responsible for significant emissions of potent greenhouse gases and other pollutants. In this study, the environmental aspects of pasteurized milk production in Iran were investigated using a life-cycle approach. Three sub-systems, namely feed production, dairy farm and dairy factory, were taken into account to determine how and where Iranian pasteurized milk production might be made more environmentally friendly and energy efficient. The results clearly demonstrate that the feed production stage was the hot spot in pasteurized milk production in terms of energy consumption, environmental burdens and economic costs. The largest share of the total production costs belonged to animal feeds (43%), which were part of the feed production stage. The largest consumers of energy in the production of raw milk were alfalfa (30.3%), concentrate (24%), straw (17.8%) and maize (10.9%) for cows, followed by diesel fuel (6.6%) and electricity (5.6%). The global warming potential for the production of 1000kg of raw milk at the dairy-farm gate was estimated at 457kg CO2,eq.

Although the carcinogenicity of FA by oral exposure has not been proven, it is also known it cause histopathological and cytogenic changes in tissues at first contact, so its toxicity by ingestion should not be underestimated. This research determined both residual FA levels in locally produced fresh white cheese and its variation according to the seasons of the year and its association with ambient temperature. None of the FA levels quantified in cheese exceeded the maximum tolerable concentration (2.6 mg/kg) and although average FA contents did not vary significantly with seasonal changes (0.093-0.181 mg/kg), the number of positive cases did, since the highest prevalence occurred in the dry (60.9 %) and transitional dry-rainy (79.7 %) seasons of 2021, which are characterized by having the highest average ambient temperatures (27.5 °C and 28.3 °C, respectively).

It has been proposed that this epidemiological evidence could be in part attributable to environmental estrogens, compounds that display estrogen-like activity and are ubiquitously present in the environment. Environmental estrogens can be found in a wide variety of foods: phytoestrogens occur in plants such as clover and soy, while mycoestrogens are food contaminants produced by fungi. Meat, eggs and dairy products from animals given exogenous hormones contain relatively high concentration of estrogens. Among xenoestrogens, industrial estrogens are synthetic chemicals produced for specific purposes (pesticides, plastics, surfactants and detergents) while metalloestrogens are found in heavy metals. Estrogens can be also administered through medications (contraceptive pill, hormone replacement therapy, genistein, cimetidine, creams). There is a considerable burden of evidence in vitro and in animal models that these compounds may exert immunotoxic effects. However, to date there is no convincing data that exposure to environmental estrogens can be regarded as a risk for human health. In particular, there is no consensus whether prolonged exposure to relatively low concentrations of different estrogenic chemicals can affect the human immune system and induce clinically evident diseases in real-life scenario. Moreover, the effects on human health of the synergistic interactions between natural, medical, dietary and environmental estrogens have not been fully elucidated yet. Here we provide an extensive review of the in vivo and in vitro effects of environmental estrogens on the immune system, focusing on the evidences of association between exposure and autoimmune disorders."

As milk and dairy products have been implicated in more than half of the listeriosis outbreaks, we investigated the in vitro virulence of L. monocytogenes incubated in different milk types at various storage conditions. Incubation in pasteurized milk at refrigeration conditions (4°C) revealed a higher invasion and intracellular proliferation of four different L. monocytogenes strains compared to raw milk using human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells. Furthermore the period of storage, which increased L. monocytogenes cell numbers, decreased in vitro virulence. However, L. monocytogenes stored for 3weeks at 4°C in milk are still able to invade and proliferate into the host cell. Interestingly abused storage temperatures (25°C and 30°C) for a short time period (2h) revealed an attenuated impact on the in vitro virulence of L. monocytogenes compared to the storage temperature of 4°C. Regarding the major milk compounds, the level of milk fat significantly affected the in vitro virulence of L. monocytogenes. Pre-incubation in milk with high fat content (3.6%) resulted in a lower invasion capability compared to milk with low fat content. In contrast casein and lactose did not influence the invasiveness of L. monocytogenes into the host cell.

Upon dissolving propolis ethanolic extract (PEE) into glycerol, the PEE-glycerol mixture contained no visible insoluble particles and could be dispersed evenly into milk, without leaving any insoluble material. PEE, with or without glycerol, was added into extended shelf-life milk, artificially contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.

The isolates were then assessed for two risk factors, antibiotic resistance and volatile and non-volatile biogenic amine production in vitro. In total, 173 Gram-negative isolates were identified by rrs and/or rpoB gene sequencing. A large biodiversity was observed with nearly half of all Gram-negative isolates belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. Overall, 26 different genera represented by 68 species including potential new species were identified among the studied Gram-negative isolates for both surface and milk or cheese core samples. The most frequently isolated genera corresponded to Pseudomonas, Proteus, Psychrobacter, Halomonas and Serratia and represented almost 54% of the dairy collection. After Pseudomonas, Chryseobacterium, Enterobacter and Stenotrophomonas were the most frequently isolated genera found in cheese core and milk samples while Proteus, Psychrobacter, Halomonas and Serratia were the most frequently isolated genera among surface samples. Antibiotic resistance profiles indicated that resistances to the aminosid, imipemen and quinolon were relatively low while more than half of all tested isolates were resistant to antibiotics belonging to the monobactam, cephem, fosfomycin, colistin, phenicol, sulfamid and some from the penam families. Thirty-six% of isolates were negative for in vitro biogenic amine production. Among biogenic amine-producers, cadaverine was the most frequently produced followed by isoamylamine, histamine and putrescine. Only low levels (<75 mg/l) of tyramine were detected in vitro."

After ingestion by cows, aflatoxin B1 is metabolized to aflatoxin M1 (AFM1), some of which is excreted in milk. This study involved smallholder dairy farms in urban and periurban areas of Nairobi and Kisumu, Kenya. The objective was to determine the effectiveness of training and providing farmers with aflatoxin binder (NovaSil®) on AFM1 contamination in raw milk. A baseline survey was undertaken and 30 farmers whose milk had AFM1 levels above 20 ppt were randomly selected for inclusion in the study. Of these, 20 farmers were part of the intervention, and were given training on the usage of the NovaSil® binder, while 10 served as a control group. All farmers were visited biweekly for three months for interviews and milk samples were collected to measure the AFM1 levels. The AFM1 levels were quantified by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The NovaSil® binder significantly reduced AFM1 concentrations in the raw milk produced by the farmers in the intervention group over the duration of the study (p < 0.01). The control farms were more likely to have milk with AFM1 levels exceeding the regulatory limit of 50 ppt compared to the intervention farms (p < 0.001) (odds ratio = 6.5). The farmers in the intervention group perceived that there was an improvement in milk yield, and in cow health and appetite. These farmers also felt that the milk they sold, as well as the one they used at home, was safer. In conclusion, the use of binders by dairy farmers can be effective in reducing AFM1 in milk. Further research is needed to understand their effectiveness, especially when used in smallholder settings."

In developing countries, EDC dietary exposure data are scarce, especially from areas perceived as pollution hotspots, including industrialized countries like India. Several persistent organic pollutants (POPs) act as EDCs and pose a pressure to human health mainly through dietary exposure. In the present study, a range of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), dioxins and furans were measured in several food items collected from Indian urban (Delhi) and peri-urban (Dehradun) areas. Food basket contamination data were used to estimate EDC dietary exposure and compare it with that of the average European population estimated from available monitoring data. All the target contaminants were found in most food items, especially in dairies and meat products. OCPs were the main contributers to the measured EDC contamination. Food supplied to Delhi's markets had higher EDC contamination than that supplied to the peri-urban market in Dehradun. Despite lax compliance and control measures, Indian dietary exposure of OCPs and PBDEs were comparable with that of Europe and were lower for PCBs and dioxins. Higher meat consumption in Europe only partly explained this pattern which was driven also by the higher EDC residues in some European food items. A substantial part of endocrine disrupting potential in the diet derives from food and animal feeds internationally traded between developed and developing countries. With increasingly globalized food systems, internationally harmonized policies on EDC content in food can lead to better protection of health in both these contexts."

The PCDD/PCDF source was contaminated lime used in Brazilian citrus pulp pellets. The contaminated lime was mined from an industrial dump site. However, the detailed origin of the PCDD/PCDFs in the lime was not revealed. This paper investigates the contamination origin and describes the link between lime milk from the dumpsite of a chlorine/organochlorine industry and the contaminated lime. The contaminated lime stem from mining at the corporate landfill of Solvay Indupa in Sao Paulo. The landfill was used for 40 years for deposition of production residues and closed in 1996. The factory operated/operates at least two processes with potentially high PCDD/PCDFs releases namely the oxychlorination process for production of ethylene dichloride (EDC) and the chlor-alkali process. The main landfilled waste was lime milk (1.4 million tons) from the vinyl chloride monomer production (via the acetylene process) along with residues from other processes. The PCDD/PCDF fingerprint revealed that most samples from the chemical landfill showed an EDC PCDD/PCDF pattern with a characteristic octachlorodibenzofuran dominance. The PCDD/PCDF pattern of a Rio Grande sediment samples downstream the facility showed a chlor-alkali pattern with a minor impact of the EDC pattern. The case highlights that PCDD/PCDF- and persistent organic pollutants-contaminated sites need to be identified in a comprehensive manner as required by the Stockholm Convention (article 6) and controlled for their impact on the environment and human health. Landfill mining and reuse of materials from contaminated deposits should be prohibited."

Lysozyme is a natural enzyme with antimicrobial activity that has attracted considerable attention to be potentially utilized in various industries. Since lysozyme is an intrinsic component of the human immune system and has low toxicity; it could be considered as a natural antimicrobial agent for use in food and pharmaceutical industries. Lysozyme exerts antimicrobial activity against microorganisms, especially Gram-positive bacteria, by hydrolyzing 1,4-beta-linkages between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine in the cell wall. In addition, increased antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against Gram-negative bacteria could be achieved by the modification of lysozyme through physical or chemical interactions. Lysozyme is presented as a natural preservative in mammalian milk and can be utilized as a bio-preservative in dairy products, such as cheese. Both bacteria and fungi can contaminate and spoil the cheese; especially the one that is made traditionally by raw milk. Furthermore, uncontrolled and improper processes and post-pasteurization contamination can participate in the cheese contamination. Therefore, besides common preservative strategies applied in cheese production, lysozyme could be utilized alone or in combination with other preservative strategies to improve the safety of cheese.

The increasing use of sequencing technologies to identify bacteria has improved knowledge about the bacteria present in food premises. Overall, nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas spp. , followed by Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp. dominate on food processing surfaces.

Several outbreaks have been associated with the consumption of raw milk contaminated with Campylobacter spp. In the present study, the occurrence and seasonality of Campylobacter spp. in raw cow's milk were determined. Other samples from the dairy farm environment were also analyzed to understand the possible routes of contamination. The study was conducted from November 2020 to September 2021 in randomly selected dairy farms located in northern Portugal. One liter of milk was collected from bulk cooling tanks transported to the laboratory and analyzed within 24 h. Campylobacter spp. detection and identification were performed using real-time PCR methodology and confirmation followed ISO standards. From 100 dairy farms evaluated, the occurrence of Campylobacter spp. was estimated at 4.0 % in raw cow's milk samples. In the samples from the environment of the farms, only contaminated fecal samples were found, corresponding to an occurrence of 4.2 %. Positivity was observed in summer months. The results of this study indicate the potential risk of campylobacteriosis after the consumption of raw milk. Consumers who seek raw milk for health reasons should be aware of the risk, especially if they belong to vulnerable groups. Moreover, it raises the question of how climate change will impact food safety, suggesting that routine surveillance for zoonotic pathogens should be implemented in dairy farms."

This pilot study assessed the prevalence and amount of total aflatoxin contamination in commercially available dairy feed and the corresponding AFM1 contamination in raw milk from samples collected at farms using local, commercially available dairy feed across Rwanda's five provinces. The inclusion criteria to select dairy farm participants were (1) to have at least two cows and (2) use of commercially prepared dairy feeds. Importantly, the majority of cattle rearing households in Rwanda rely principally on grazing or other freely available feedstock, rather than on commercially prepared feeds. In total, 170 raw milk samples were collected during one sampling period from dairy farms using commercially prepared dairy feeds. In addition, 154 dairy feed samples were collected simultaneously with the milk samples. These farms were previously targeted in a larger study measuring aflatoxin contamination of Rwandan feeds and feed ingredients. The mean AFM1 concentration in these samples was 0.89 ± 1.64 µg/l (median: 0.33 µg/l) with a maximum of 14.5 µg/l. Maize bran was the principal dairy feed ingredient used by farmers in the sampling, representing more than 65% of the total feed samples collected, with mean aflatoxin concentration of 90.5 µg/kg (median 32.3 µg/kg). The authors note that this preliminary sampling is not generalizable across Rwandan milk production and consumption; the limited pilot study presented here was not designed with the robustness necessary for broad-scale generalization. Thus, the data presented should not be broadly applied outside of the context of the study."

Ammonia concentrations and climatic measurements were made on 3 dairy farms during winter, summer, and autumn to calculate emissions using an inverse-dispersion analysis technique. These study farms were confinement systems utilizing freestall housing with nearby sand separators and lagoons for waste management. Emissions were calculated from the whole farm including the barns and any waste management components (lagoons and sand separators), and from these components alone when possible. During winter, the lagoons' NH3 emissions were very low and not measurable.

In an attempt to reduce such milk residues, a template procedure was developed, tried and tested on 43 farms (from 3 processing companies). This involved identifying farms with high TCM milk, applying corrective action in the form of advice and recommendations to reduce TCM and re-measuring milks from these farms. Trichloromethane in milk was measured by head-space gas chromatography with electron capture detector. The TCM reduction strategy proved successful in significantly reducing the levels in milk in the farms tested, e. g. TCM was reduced from 0.006 to the target of 0.002 mg/kg (P < 0.05). The strategy was then applied to farms who supplied milk to six Irish dairy processors with the objective of reducing TCM in those milks to a level of ≤ 0.002 mg/kg. Initially, milk tankers containing milks from approximately 10-15 individual farms were sampled and analysed and tankers with high TCM (>0.002 mg/kg) identified. Individual herd milks contributing to these tankers were subsequently sampled and analysed and farms supplying high TCM identified. Guidance and advice was provided to the high TCM milk suppliers and levels of TCM of these milk supplies were monitored subsequently.

Pathogenic microorganisms can attach to food surfaces, grow on them, and form biofilm that cause an increase in the food safety risk. The mechanisms of biofilm formation have become an important issue in the food-processing industry, therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the biofilm formation and profiles of genes involved in biofilm production of staphylococci isolated from various foodstuff products. MATERIAL AND METHODS:This cross-sectional study was conducted at some grocery stores and confectionaries from September 2015 to October 2016 in different areas of Isfahan, Iran. Staphylococcus spp were isolated from different foodstuff samples including sweet pastries, cakes and similar baked goods, dairy products such as cheese and yogurt, meat products such as sausages, and hamburgers. Standard microbiological methods were used for identification of Staphylococcus spp isolates. Antibiotic susceptibility pattern was determined by the disc diffusion method and icaA/icaD genes have been investigated as PCR target because of their role in the expression of intercellular adhesions involved in biofilm formation by S. aureus. RESULTS:From a total of 194 different foodstuffs samples, 84 Staphylococcus spp were isolated. Out of the 84 Staphylococcus isolates, 95.2% (80/84) were positive to the ability of biofilm formation. Overall, 35.7% (30/84) and 26.2% (22/84) of Staphylococcus spp isolates were positive for icaA and icaD genes, respectively.

It is anticipated that consumption of lactic acid bacteria capable of binding aflatoxins can reduce the risk of AFM1 on human health to a certain extent. Seldom reports have hinted the possibility of using lactic acid bacteria for the biological detoxification of AFM1. Hence, the present study was conducted to assess the ability of selected probiotic Lactobacillus strains for their AFM1 binding ability in PBS and to reduce its bioaccessibility in artificially contaminated skim milk using an in vitro digestion model. Eleven tested probiotic strains illustrated various degrees of AFM1 binding ability ranging from 4.13 to 64.16%. Five among the 11 probiotic strains were subsequently selected for detailed studies on the basis of highest binding potential after 24 h of incubation period. The stability of bacterial-AFM1 complex was assessed by repeated washings with AFM1 free PBS. The observation on bacterial-AFM1 complex stability showed small release of AFM1 in first and second wash (17.30 to 0.98%) where as none was detectable in the third wash. However, upon chloroform extraction, 88.57 to 92.30% of bound AFM1 was released from the bacterial cells which indicate AFM1 binding to the bacterial cell surface rather than absorption or degradation of AFM1 by bacterial cells. During the in vitro digestion test in skim milk, bioaccessibility of AFM1 was reduced to a scale of 32.61 to 52.84% in the presence of selected strains of probiotic lactobacilli. The present findings suggest that selected probiotic strains could be potentially used to mitigate the toxic effects of AFM1 in the contaminated milk and milk products and thereby enhance food safety."

Free forms formed during digestive hydrolysis of esters such as 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD), 2-MCPD and glycidol can provoke a negative effect on human health. Therefore the quantitative determination of MCPDE and GE in edible oils, fats and fat blends is needed. The aim - this manuscript deals with MCPDE and GE concentration measured as free 3-MCPD, 2-MCPD and glycidol in different edible oils, fats and fat blends of Russian market. Material and methods. 55 edible oil and fat samples sold on Russian market including refined and non-refined oils and fat blends such as spreads, dairy fat replacers, and margarines have been analyzed. Slow alkaline transesterification method with GC-MS/MS was used. Results. According to the data obtained, the highest concentrations of the contaminants were detected in fat blends: <0.10-5.03 mg/kg for 3-MCPD, <0.10-2.50 mg/kg for 2-MCPD and 0.1 5-11.17 mg/kg for glycidol. In palm oils and its fractions concentration of 3-MCPD was <0.10-6.61 mg/kg, 2-MCPD - <0.10-2.69 mg/kg and glycidol - <0.10-6.29 mg/kg. The content of glycidol in sunflower oils fluctuated in the range <0.10-1.19 mg/kg, 3-MCPD was <0.10-2.47 mg/kg, and 2-MCPD <0.10-0.67 mg/kg. Non-refined edible oils and olive oils had no or little MCPDE or GE. Conclusion. In this work we indicate high importance of monitoring MCPDE and GE in edible oils and fats both as ready-to-eat products and as ingredients prior to the Russian market release. There is strong need in mitigation of these process contaminants during fat blends manufacturing."

In the period between April and July 2015, an increased number of cases of listeriosis was observed in the area of Pavia, Northern Italy. An epidemiological investigation identified a cheesemaking small organic farm as the possible origin of the outbreak. In this work we present the results of the retrospective epidemiological study that we performed using molecular biology and genomic epidemiology methods. The strains sampled from patients and those from the target farm's cheese were analyzed using PFGE and whole genome sequencing (WGS) based methods. The performed WGS based analyses included: a) in-silico MLST typing; b) SNPs calling and genetic distance evaluation; c) determination of the resistance and virulence genes profiles; d) SNPs based phylogenetic reconstruction. Three of the patient strains and all the cheese strains resulted to belong to the same phylogenetic cluster, in Sequence Type 29. A further accurate SNPs analysis revealed that two of the three patient strains and all the cheese strains were highly similar (0.8 SNPs of average distance) and exhibited a higer distance from the third patient isolate (9.4 SNPs of average distance). Despite the global agreement among the results of the PFGE and WGS epidemiological studies, the latter approach agree with epidemiological data in indicating that one the patient strains could have originated from a different source.

Therefore, it is important to know the factors affecting its quality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the raw milk microbial quality and factors affecting it. A total of 4260 raw cow milk samples, which were collected from villages around Garmsar city, Iran, and their microbial load were registered at Garmsar Dairy Cow Association between 2013 and 2014, was used in the present study. The total average ± SD of microbial load concentration was 3.02 × 105 ± 2.75 × 105 (CFU/ml). The average concentration of total bacteria in 2013 was 2.73 × 105 ± 1.58 × 105 (CFU/ml) and in 2014 it was 3.32 × 105 ± 3.93 × 105(CFU/ml). Seasonally, it was 2.94 × 105 ± 1.72 × 105 (CFU/ml), 3.69 × 105 ± 4.55 × 105 (CFU/ml), 2.91 × 105 ± 1.62 × 105 (CFU/ml), and 2.63 × 105 ± 1.67 × 105 (CFU/ml) for spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. There was a significant difference in seasonal average microbial concentration of milk samples (p < 0.05). The present study concludes that microbial load of milk can be affected by environmental and hygienic conditions. Ranchers need to pay more attention to hygiene especially in warm seasons. Because in case of high microbial load in raw milk, even after milk pasteurization, it is not possible to have a high-quality and desirable product. Milk producers and distributors need also awareness in order to reduce the incidence of secondary contamination.

Consumption of contaminated foods, such as dairy products, can lead to food poisoning caused by heat-stable staphylococcal toxins that are not easily destroyed during pasteurization. The objective of this study was to investigate the growth kinetics of S. aureus and background microorganisms in camel milk stored at different temperatures between 8 and 43°C using one-step kinetic analysis to estimate the kinetic parameters from the observed growth curves. The growth of S. aureus showed apparent lag, exponential, and stationary phases, whereas no or negligible lag phase was observed for background microorganisms. Data analysis showed that the estimated minimum, optimum, and maximum growth temperatures were 5.9, 42.0, and 49.2°C for S. aureus, and 3.0, 38.6, and 49.2°C for the background microorganisms, respectively. The estimated optimum specific growth rate was higher for S. aureus (1.24 h-1) than for background microorganisms (0.995 h-1). This study found that camel milk may inhibit the growth of S. aureus, as it exhibits a lower specific growth rate than that in cow milk or cooked potato. It also has a longer lag phase than that in cow milk at comparable temperature ranges. This unique property is probably related to the presence of some antimicrobial compounds naturally occurring in camel milk. Validation of kinetic parameters and models showed that the root mean square error of prediction was only 0.5 log cfu/mL for S. aureus and background microorganisms, suggesting that the models are reasonably accurate. These models can be used for conducting risk assessments of S. aureus and predicting the general microbiological shelf life of camel milk to prevent foodborne staphylococcal poisoning."

The second German food consumption survey (Nationale Verzehrsstudie II - NVS II) with about 20 000 participants (15 371 for dietary history interviews used for this study) allowed for an updated exposure assessment for the German population. Based on these comprehensive data, information on the consumption of 545 individual food items by the German population was generated. Cadmium concentrations in food were compiled from the German food monitoring programme, European countries' authority programmes and the published literature, covering the years from 1993 to 2008, and were multiplied with consumption data to obtain estimates of cadmium intake from food. Consumption-weighted mean cadmium concentrations per main food group were highest for cereals, followed by oily seeds & fruits, and vegetables. Due to both high consumption and considerable occurrence of cadmium, cereals and vegetables contributed most to the intake of the general public, followed by the main groups beverages, fruits & nuts, and dairy products (including milk). Cadmium intake from food was estimated to be 1.46 and 2.35 µg kg(-1) bw week(-1) for average and high-end consumers, respectively. This corresponds to 58% for average and 95% for high-end consumers, respectively, of a reference value derived from a recent health risk evaluation performed by EFSA, using the benchmark approach. Uncertainties in these estimates pertain to the influence of values below the limit of quantification and some foods not considered due to lacking occurrence data. In conclusion, the estimated cadmium intake of the German population from food is still close to health-based reference values. Further efforts to reduce cadmium intake are required."

The maximum blood concentrations of ochratoxin A and α, respectively, were dose dependent and were observed, on average, 6 and 8h after exposure. Long-term exposure increased the maximum concentration of ochratoxin A detected in blood, whereas ochratoxin α was not affected. In contrast, the time to reach the maximum concentration was reduced to 3h for both molecules. Ochratoxins, essentially ochratoxin α, were mainly excreted in feces.

The ISO-IDF method includes two enrichment steps, plating of the second enrichment broth on E. sakazakii isolation agar (a chromogenic selective agar), picking of five typical colonies for transfer onto tryptone soy agar, and subsequent confirmation of yellow-pigmented colonies by biochemical characterization. Twenty-two of the 38 samples were positive by the culture method.

This study aimed at evaluating AFM1 levels especially above international (European Food Safety Authority, EFSA) (0.05 µg/kg) and local (Ghana Standards Authority, GSA) (0.5 µg/kg) standards and cancer risks associated with the ingestion of raw cow milk (n = 120) sampled from Southern Ghana (Greater Accra, Volta, Western and Eastern Regions). AFM1 were measured with High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with a Fluorescence Detector (HPLC-FLD). Risk assessments were also conducted using models prescribed by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Additives (JECFA). Out of the 120 samples analyzed for AFM1, 67 (55.8%) tested positive, 63 (52.5%) exceeded the limits of EFSA and were between the range 0.06 ± 0.001-3.52 ± 0.5 µg/kg whereas 50(41.7%) within the range of 0.50 ± 0.03-3.52.01 ± 0.5 µg/kg exceeded GSA limits. Risk assessments of AFM1 for infants, toddlers, children, adolescents, and adults ranged between 0.06 and 2.03 ng/kg bw/day, 197.04-6666.67, 0-0.0323 ng aflatoxins/kg bw/day and 1.94 × 10-3- 0.07 cases/100,000 person/yr respectively for Estimated Daily Intake (EDI), Margin of Exposure (MOE), Average Potency, and Cancer Risks. It was concluded that the consumption of raw milk posed adverse health effects on all age categories studied for the regions investigated. The use of raw cow milk may cause some problems and endanger the health of people of different age groups due to noncompliance with prescribed regulatory limits."

The objective of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the genomic attributes, diversity, virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) profiles of the STEC from preweaned and postweaned dairy calves in commercial dairy herds. In total, 31 non-O157 STEC were identified as part of a larger study focused on the pangenome of >1000 E. coli isolates from the faeces of preweaned and postweaned dairy calves on commercial dairy farms. These 31 genomes were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 platform. Based on the phylogenetic analyses, the STEC isolates were determined to be polyphyletic, with at least three phylogroups: A (32%), B1 (58%), and G (3%). These phylogroups represented at least 16 sequence types and 11 serogroups, including two of the 'big six' serogroups, O103 and O111. Several Shiga toxin gene subtypes were identified in the genomes, including stx1a, stx2a, stx2c, stx2d, and stx2g. Using the ResFinder database, the majority of the isolates (>50%) were determined to be multidrug-resistant strains because they harboured genes conferring resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobials, including some of human health significance (e. g. , β-lactams, macrolides, and fosfomycin). Additionally, non-O157 STEC strain persistence and transmission within a farm was observed. Dairy calves are a reservoir of phylogenomically diverse multidrug-resistant non-O157 STEC.

Study subjects included women (n=350) who were admitted for delivery at the local hospitals. Maternal and cord blood samples were collected to measure total mercury and each participant was required to answer a questionnaire. The 90th percentile of mercury levels in maternal and cord blood of the total population was 1.15 μg/l and 1.67 μg/l, respectively. Site 1 (Manguzi) participants had the highest maternal geometric mean (GM) values of 0.93 μg/l, which was significantly different from Site 2 (Port Shepstone) (0.49 μg/l) and Site 3 (Empangeni) (0.56 μg/l) (ANOVA test, p<0.001). Umbilical cord blood GM Hg level for Site 1 (1.45 μg/l) was more than double the GM Hg level in Site 2 (0.70 μg/l) and Site 3 (0.73 μg/l). Univariate analysis indicated that the following maternal characteristics were positive predictors for elevated umbilical cord Hg levels: maternal blood Hg levels, living with a partner, residing in Site 1, living in informal housing, using wood and gas for cooking, borehole water as a drinking source, and a member of the household being involved in fishing. Maternal dietary predictors of elevated Hg levels in umbilical cord blood included consuming fresh fish, tinned fish, fruit or dairy products, daily. This study provides baseline data and reveals that 2% of the study population were above the EPA's reference value (5.8 μg/l) suggesting low level exposure to mercury in pregnant women and the developing foetus in South Africa.

In order to reduce environmental contamination, control measures for manure were implemented because of the assumption that manure was highly contaminated with Coxiella burnetii. The aims of this study were 1) to clarify the role of C. burnetii contaminated manure from dairy goat farms in the transmission of C. burnetii to humans, 2) to assess the impact of manure storage on temperature profiles in dunghills, and 3) to calculate the decimal reduction time of the Nine Mile RSA 493 reference strain of C. burnetii under experimental conditions in different matrices. For these purposes, records on distribution of manure from case and control herds were mapped and a potential relation to incidences of human Q fever was investigated. Additionally, temperatures in two dunghills were measured and related to heat resistance of C. burnetii. Results of negative binomial regression showed no significant association between the incidence of human Q fever cases and the source of manure. Temperature measurements in the core and shell of dunghills on two farms were above 40°C for at least ten consecutive days which would result in a strong reduction of C. burnetii over time. Our findings indicate that there is no relationship between incidence of human Q fever and land applied manure from dairy goat farms with an abortion wave caused by C. burnetii. Temperature measurements in dunghills on two farms with C. burnetii shedding dairy goat herds further support the very limited role of goat manure as a transmission route during the Dutch human Q fever outbreak. It is very likely that the composting process within a dunghill will result in a clear reduction in the number of viable C. burnetii."

The metabolite of TPP, diphenyl phosphate (DPP) was detected most commonly (100%), with TDCPP metabolite, bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCPP), detected in 85-95% of samples, and ITP metabolite, monoisopropylphenyl phenyl phosphate (ip-DPP), detected in 81% of samples (n = 21).

This study is the first to explore the presence of AFM1 in breast milk samples from Bangladesh and assess infant exposure to this toxin, as a consequence of maternal mycotoxin intake. A total of 62 breast milk samples were collected from nursing mothers in Sylhet region of Bangladesh. The milk samples were collected between October 2019 and March 2020 and analyzed by a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. AFM1 was detected in 51.6% of the breast milk samples (colostrum, transitional and mature milk), with a mean concentration of 4.42 ± 0.56 pg/mL, and in the range between LOD (4.0 pg/mL) and 6.66 pg/mL. The frequent detection of AFM1 in breast milk indicates widespread dietary exposure to mycotoxins in our cohort. The estimated average daily intake of AFM1 for all nursed infants was 0.49 ng/kg b. w. /day. No significant correlations were observed between AFM1 levels in human milk and food items regularly consumed by nursing women. Overall, AFM1 levels in breast milk samples from the Sylhet region of Bangladesh are moderate, and lower than the permissible levels established for AFM1 in dairy milk or infant formulae (50 and 25 ng/kg, respectively). Yet, this first data for AFM1 breast milk contaminant levels just reflect the recent situation in one cohort, and monitoring should be continued."

The aim of this study was to analyze and to compare the presence of putative virulence factors codified in plasmid -katP, espP, subA, stcE- and adhesins involved in colonization of cattle -efa1, iha- in 255 native STEC strains isolated from different categories of cattle from different production systems. The most prevalent gene in all strains was espP, and the less prevalent was stcE. katP was highly detected in strains isolated from young and rearing calves (33.3%), while subA was predominant in those isolated from adults (71.21%). Strains from young calves showed the highest percentage of efa1 (72.46%), while iha showed a high distribution in strains from rearing calves and adults (87.04 and 98.48% respectively). It was observed that espP and iha were widely distributed throughout all strains, whereas katP, stcE, and efa1 were more associated with the presence of eae and subA with the eae-negative strains. A great proportion of eae-negative strains were isolated from adults -dairy and grazing farms- and from rearing calves -dairy and feedlot-, while mostly of the eae-positive strains were isolated from dairy young calves.

One isolate was obtained from a pet (dog), one from an exotic animal (a circus elephant), and four human isolates were obtained during a severe food poisoning outbreak that occurred in Sicily in 2015. All the strains were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), for antibiotic resistance and presence of toxin genes. PFGE results showed 10 different pulsotypes, with three relatively frequent and three unique. The antibiotic resistance profiling showed that penicillin G (35.7%) and tetracycline (20.2%) resistance is largely spread. Most isolates contained at least one toxin gene making them a potential threat for public health. Enterotoxin sec gene was observed in 28.6% and seg in 23.8% of the strains, respectively; the human isolates were the only ones to concurrently harbor both seg and sei genes. In addition, 24 isolates were randomly selected and analyzed by multilocus sequence typing. Interestingly, the analysis showed the presence of 12 sequence types (STs), of which 6 were novel. One of them, ST700, was detected in 29% of the isolates and was found to be spread throughout Sicily. ST700 has been present in the island for almost 16 years (1998-2014) and it shows no host preference since it was isolated from different ruminant species.

This poses challenges in assessing the risk to humans from the diverse range of VTEC strains that may be recovered from animals, the environment, or food. For routine assessment of risk posed by VTEC recovered from the agri-food chain, the concept of seropathotype can be used to rank the human risk potential from a particular VTEC serogroup on the basis of both serotype (top seven serogroups) and the presence of particular virulence genes (vt in combination with eae, or aaiC plus aggR). But for other VTEC serogroups or virulence gene combinations, it is not currently possible to fully assess the risk posed. VTEC is shed in animal feces and can persist in the farm environment for extended periods ranging from several weeks to many months, posing an ongoing reservoir of contamination for grazing animals, water courses, and fresh produce and for people using farmland for recreational purposes. Appropriate handling and treatment of stored animal waste (slurries and manures) will reduce risk from VTEC in the farm environment.

In the face of recommended use restrictions for antimicrobial agents in livestock operations, current AMR patterns in known foodborne pathogens should be documented. The objective of this study was to document AMR patterns in EcO157 isolates from dairies in northern Colorado using antimicrobial agents commonly found on dairies and representative of medically important antimicrobial drug classes. Seventy-five EcO157 isolates were recovered from three dairies. Six isolates were resistant to at least 1 of the 10 tested antimicrobial agents: four were resistant to streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline; one was resistant to streptomycin and tetracycline; and one was resistant to only tetracycline. All resistant isolates were from a single dairy. Overall, a low prevalence (8%) of AMR was observed among the 75 EcO157 isolates. No significant effects on AMR profiles due to virulence genes, parity, or previous antimicrobial treatments within the current lactation period were detected. The results of this study provide background information for future comparative studies investigating AMR trends. Future studies should include more participating farms and more samples and should control for potential confounding factors of AMR that may underlie individual farm variation."

In the food chain, the original mycotoxin may be transformed in other toxic compounds, reaching the consumer. A good example is the occurrence of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in dairy products, which is due to the presence of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in the animal feed. Thus, milk-based foods, such as cheese and yogurts, may be contaminated with this toxin, which, although less toxic than AFB1, also exhibits hepatotoxic and carcinogenic effects and is relatively stable during pasteurization, storage and processing. For this reason, the establishment of allowed maximum limits in dairy products and the development of methodologies for its detection and quantification are of extreme importance. There are several methods for the detection of AFM1 in dairy products. Usually, the analytical procedures go through the following stages: sampling, extraction, clean-up, determination and quantification. For the extraction stage, the use of organic solvents (as acetonitrile and methanol) is still the most common, but recent advances include the use of the Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe method (QuEChERS) and proteolytic enzymes, which have been demonstrated to be good alternatives. For the clean-up stage, the high selectivity of immunoaffinity columns is still a good option, but alternative and cheaper techniques are becoming more competitive. Regarding quantification of the toxin, screening strategies include the use of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to select presumptive positive samples from a wider range of samples, and more reliable methods-high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection or mass spectroscopy-for the separation, identification and quantification of the toxin."

In response, some dairy processors increased the times and temperatures of pasteurization well above the legal minimum for high temperature, short time pasteurization (72 °C for 15 s), with unknown implications for public health. The present study was conducted to determine whether an increase in high temperature, short time pasteurization temperature would affect the growth of Listeria monocytogenes, a potentially lethal foodborne pathogen normally eliminated with proper pasteurization but of concern when milk is contaminated postpasteurization. L. monocytogenes growth during refrigerated storage was higher in milk pasteurized at 82 °C than in milk pasteurized at 72 °C. Specifically, the time lag before exponential growth was decreased and the maximum population density was increased. The public health impact of this change in pasteurization was evaluated using a quantitative microbial risk assessment of deaths from listeriosis attributable to consumption of pasteurized fluid milk that was contaminated postprocessing. Conservative estimates of the effect of pasteurizing all fluid milk at 82 °C rather than 72 °C are that annual listeriosis deaths from consumption of this milk would increase from 18 to 670, a 38-fold increase (8.7- to 96-fold increase, 5th and 95th percentiles). These results exemplify a situation in which response to a rare bioterror threat may have the unintended consequence of putting the public at increased risk of a known, yet severe harm and illustrate the need for a paradigm shift toward multioutcome risk benefit analyses when proposing changes to established food safety practices."

Based on epidemiological studies, a benchmark dose (lower/higher bound estimate) between 0.3 and 8 μg/kg bw/day was estimated to cause a 1 % increased risk of lung, skin and bladder cancer. A recently published study by EFSA on dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic in the European population reported 95th percentiles (lower bound min to upper bound max) for different age groups in the same range as the benchmark dose. For toddlers, a highly exposed group, the highest values ranged between 0.61 and 2.09 µg arsenic/kg bw/day. For all other age classes, the margin of exposure is also small. This scenario calls for regulatory action to reduce arsenic exposure. One priority measure should be to reduce arsenic in food categories that contribute most to exposure. In the EFSA study the food categories 'milk and dairy products,' 'drinking water' and 'food for infants' represent major sources of inorganic arsenic for infants and also rice is an important source. Long-term strategies are required to reduce inorganic arsenic in these food groups. The reduced consumption of rice and rice products which has been recommended may be helpful for a minority of individuals consuming unusually high amounts of rice. However, it is only of limited value for the general European population, because the food categories 'grain-based processed products (non rice-based)' or 'milk and dairy products' contribute more to the exposure with inorganic arsenic than the food category 'rice. ' A balanced regulatory activity focusing on the most relevant food categories is required. In conclusion, exposure to inorganic arsenic represents a risk to the health of the European population, particularly to young children. Regulatory measures to reduce exposure are urgently required."

The present study investigated the potential and reliability of terpenoids as traceable compounds in Idiazabal PDO cheeses made with raw milk from commercial sheep flocks grazed on lowlands or mountain grasslands. Terpenoids were analysed in individual pasture plants and ripened cheeses. Ingested diets were estimated by microscopic examination of plant residues in sheep faeces, and terpenoid composition of pastures and sheep diets were calculated from isolated plant species analysis. About 100 individual terpenoids were detected in botanical species collected from pastures and 40 compounds in mature cheeses. Important differences were found in the abundance of terpenoids identified in lowland and highland pastures mainly depending on the botanical family and the contribution of each botanical species to both type of grasslands. Estimated sheep diet composition of lowland and highland flocks was different and, in consequence, ingested terpenoids calculated from the estimated diet composition and individual plant terpene analysis were different. The multivariate approach provided robustness in the terpenoid traceability from pasture to cheese selecting individual terpenoids, particularly sesquiterpenoids such as γ-cadinene and aromadendrene, which strongly contributed to discriminate between mountain and valley cheeses. These results can help regulatory bodies to implement effective traceability and authentication procedures to identify mountain cheeses and to protect added-value dairy products."

A rise in Campylobacter gastroenteritis in an isolated population was investigated using whole-genome sequencing (WGS), an epidemiological study, and environmental investigations. A single strain was identified in 20 cases, clearly distinguishable from other local strains and a reference population by WGS. A case-case analysis showed association of infection with the outbreak strain and milk from a single dairy (odds ratio, 8; Fisher exact test P value =.023). Despite temperature records indicating effective pasteurization, mechanical faults likely to lead to incomplete pasteurization of part of the milk were identified by further testing and examination of internal components of dairy equipment. Here, milk distribution concentrated on a small area, including school-aged children with low background incidence of campylobacteriosis, facilitated outbreak identification. Low-level contamination of widely distributed milk would not produce as detectable an outbreak signal. Such hidden outbreaks may contribute to the substantial burden of apparently sporadic Campylobacter from cattle where transmission routes are not certain. The effective discrimination of outbreak isolates from a reference population using WGS shows that integrating these data and approaches into surveillance could support the detection as well as investigation of such outbreaks."

We demonstrated that management of the maternity area is an important factor in the control of Johne's disease. Although it is believed that the highest risk group for JD infection is calves under 6 mo, the cleanliness scores of older heifers and their exposure to mature cow manure was significantly associated with JD control; farms with highly contaminated weaned and bred heifers and those that had exposure to mature cow manure were more likely to be unsuccessful in their JD control efforts.

Mycobacterium paratuberculosis is easily transmitted through consumption of contaminated milk; therefore, finding safe methods to reduce the mycobacterial load in milk and other dairy products is important to the dairy industry. The main objective of the current study was to investigate the effect of natural products, such as bacteriocins designated as ""generally regarded as safe"" (GRAS), on the survival of M. paratuberculosis in milk. Commercially synthesized bacteriocin (nisin) was used to examine its effect on the survival of laboratory and field isolates of M. paratuberculosis and in contaminated milk. Surprisingly, nisin had a higher minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the laboratory strain (M. paratuberculosis K10), at 500 U/mL, than against field isolates (e. g. , M. paratuberculosis 4B and JTC 1281), at 15 U/mL. In milk, growth of M. paratuberculosis was inhibited after treatment with levels of nisin that are permissible in human food at 4°C and 37°C. Using both fluorescent and scanning electron microscopy, we were able to identify defects in the bacterial cell walls of treated cultures. Our analysis indicated that nisin reduced membrane integrity by forming pores in the mycobacterial cell wall, thereby decreasing survival of M. paratuberculosis. Thus, nisin treatment of milk could be implemented as a control measure to reduce M. paratuberculosis secreted in milk from infected herds. Nisin could also be used to reduce M. paratuberculosis in colostrum given to calves from infected animals, improving biosecurity control in dairy herds affected by Johne's disease."

Feed additive assessment incorporates consumer safety as well as animal health and welfare, which, in turn, can affect productivity and hence food security. The safety of feed users and the environment are other important components of the assessment process which, therefore, builds on a One Health perspective. In several instances the assessment entails a balanced assessment of benefits and risks for humans, animals and/or the environment. Three case studies are selected to discuss issues for a consistent framework on Risk-Benefit Assessment (RBA) of feed additives, based on EFSA opinions and literature: (a) Supplementation of feeds with trace elements with recognized human toxicity (cobalt, iodine) - RBA question: can use levels, hence human exposure, be reduced without increasing the risk of deficiency in animals?; (b) Aflatoxin binders in dairy animals - RBA question: can the use reduce the risk for human health due to aflatoxin M1, without unexpected adverse effects for animals or humans?; (c) Use of formaldehyde as preservative in feedstuffs to prevent microbial contamination - RBA question: is the reduction of microbiological risks outweighed by risks for the consumers, farmed animals or the workers? The case studies indicate that the safety of use of feed additives can involve RBA considerations which fit into a One Health perspective. As in other RBA circumstances, the main issues are defining the question and finding ""metrics"" that allow a R/B comparison; in the case of feed additives, R and B may concern different species (farm animals and humans). A robust assessment of animal requirements, together with sustainability considerations, might be a significant driving force for a RBA leading to a safe and effective use."

Many studies, in vivo and in vitro, have revealed abnormal reproductive function following exposure to these compounds. The number of chemicals known to have the potential to modulate endocrine functions is increasing. In contrast to humans and wildlife, the potential reproductive effects of exposure of domestic animals to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDC) have been studied little. The aim of this overview is to evaluate the possible contribution of EDC to reproductive failure in domestic ruminants. Sources and classes of EDC are discussed as well as their structure and the modes of hormone disruption. Endocrine disrupting agents may interfere with the reproductive processes of both males and females at several points of the reproductive cycle and through a range of physiological mechanisms. Extrapolating from the results obtained with laboratory animals, the mechanisms whereby infertility in domestic ruminants might be expressed by exposure to EDC through contaminated food and drinking water are addressed. A preliminary risk assessment is included and it is concluded that under certain circumstances there may be a significantly enhanced intake of oestrogenic hormones and EDC through sewage-contaminated water or soil-contaminated herbage. The physiological consequences for domestic ruminants of EDC ingestion, at the rates estimated, are largely unknown. However, the levels of exposure to oestrogenic hormones and phthalates in grazing ruminants are such that when studying fertility problems in high-yielding dairy cattle the impacts of exposure to endocrine disruptors via the food and drinking water cannot be neglected."

Therefore, food safety risks are generally detected only when the problems have developed too far to allow preventive measures. Successful early warning systems should identify signals that precede the development of a food safety risk. Moreover, such signals could be identified in factors from domains adjacent to the food supply chain, so-called drivers of change and other indicators. In this study, we show for the first time, using the dairy supply chain as an application case, that such drivers and indicators may indeed represent signals that precede the detection of a food safety risk. Using dynamic unsupervised anomaly detection models, anomalies were detected in indicator data expected by domain experts to impact the development of food safety risks in milk. Detrended cross-correlation analysis was used to demonstrate that anomalies in various indicators preceded reports of contaminated milk. Lag times of more than 12 months were observed. Similar results were observed for the 6 largest milk-producing countries in Europe (i. e. , Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom). Additionally, a Bayesian network was used to identify the food safety hazards associated with an anomaly for the Netherlands. These results suggest that severe changes in domains adjacent to the food supply chain may trigger the development of food safety problems that become visible many months later. Awareness of such relationships will provide the opportunity for food producers or inspectors to take timely measures to prevent food safety problems. A fully automated system for data collection, processing, analysis and warning, such as that presented in this study, may further support the uptake of such an approach."

Annual average concentrations of total PFOA and PFOS ranged from 0.026 to 0.112 µg L-1 (irrigation water), and from 0.818 to 1.364 µg kg-1 (soil), respectively. PFOA and PFOS hotspots were identified downstream of the Nakdong River and were influenced by seasonal climatic variations. The observed average biennial concentration of the sum of PFOA and PFOS decreased in irrigation water, from 0.112 µg L-1 in 2013 to 0.026 µg L-1 in 2015, suggests that the 2013 Persistent Organic Pollutants Control Act may have helped to reduce levels of PFAS at this location. This study calculated some of the highest plant uptake factors reported to date, with values ranging from 0.962 in green onions to < 0.004 in plums. Leafy vegetables and rice are important components of the Korean diet; these groups had the largest contribution to the estimated dietary intake of PFOA and PFOS, which was calculated at 0.449 and 0.140 ng kg bw -1 day-1, respectively. This corresponded to 66.4% for PFOA and 7.9% for PFOS of the EFSA reference dose (RfD). The dietary intake of PFOA and PFOS from crops alone did not exceed the RfD. However, when the estimated daily intake (EDI) from other sources such as tap water, meat, fish, dairy, and beverages was included in the exposure risk assessment, both of the EDIs to PFOA and PFOS exceeded the RfDs, indicating that there may be a risk to human health. This study concludes that consumption of crops might, therefore, be a significant and underappreciated pathway for human exposure to PFAS."

A country such as India, where its biggest strength is its demographic dividend, cannot afford to malnutrition a large population of its children by allowing them to consume contaminated and adulterated dairy products. In view of the gravity of the situation, we propose a blockchain-enabled supply chain platform for the dairy industry. With respect to the supply chain platform, the dairy products of choice include milk, cheese, and butter. Blockchain is one of the fastest growing technologies having widespread acceptance across multiple industry verticals. Blockchain possesses the power to transform traditional supply chains into decentralized, robust, transparent, tamper proof, and sustainable supply chains. The proposed supply chain platform goes beyond the aspect of food traceability and focuses on maintaining the nutritional values of dairy products, identification of adulteration and contamination in dairy products, the increasing economic viability of running a dairy farm, preventing counterfeit dairy products, and enhancing the revenue of the dairy company. The paper collates the mentioned functionalities into four distinct impact dimensions: social, economic, operations, and sustainability. The proposed blockchain-enabled dairy supply chain platform combines the use of smart contracts, quick response code (QR code) technology, and IoT and has the potential to redefine the dairy supply chains on socio-economic, operational, and sustainability parameters."

Contaminated milk might expose humans to that pathogen. The aim of the present study was to develop a novel real-time PCR assay providing the additional possibility to detect viable Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) based on the MAP-specific Mptb52.16 target. The design included an internal amplification control to identify false negative results. Inclusivity and exclusivity tested on 10 MAP strains, 22 non-MAP mycobacteria, and 16 raw milk microflora strains achieved 100%. The detection limit in artificially contaminated raw milk was 2.42 × 101 MAP cells/ml milk. In a survey of naturally contaminated samples obtained from dairy herds with a known history of paratuberculosis, 47.8% pre-milk and 51.9% main milk samples tested positive. Real-time PCR-derived MAP-specific bacterial cell equivalents (bce) ranged from 1 × 100 to 5.1 × 102 bce/51 ml; the majority of samples had less than one bce per ml milk. Expression of the chosen target was detected in artificially contaminated raw milk as well as inoculated Dubos broth, thus confirming the real-time PCR assay's potential to detect viable MAP cells. Concentrating the DNA of a large sample volume in combination with the newly developed real-time PCR assay permitted quantification of low levels of MAP cells in raw milk and pasteurized milk. The selected target - Mptb52.16 - is promising with regard to the detection of viable MAP.

The critical elements in this determination are: (1) quantitative determination of the difference between S100 and regular dairy ingredients, (2) comparison of exposures resulting from proposed uses to background exposures already in the American diet, and (3) corroborative results of controlled clinical trials comparing safety outcomes from consumption of S100 with those of conventional dairy ingredients.

In comparison with perchlorate levels reported for other countries, perchlorate levels in urine samples from fireworks sites and nonfireworks sites in China were higher. Median indoor dust perchlorate concentrations were positively correlated (r = 0.964, p < 0.001) with outdoor dust perchlorate levels reported previously. The total daily intake (EDI total) of perchlorate, estimated based on urinary levels, ranged from 0.090 to 27.72 μg/kg body weight (bw)/day for all studied participants; the percentage of donors who had EDI total exceeding the reference dose (RfD) recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) was 79%, 48%, and 25% for toddlers (median: 1.829 μg/kg bw/day), adults (0.669 μg/kg bw/day), and children (median: 0.373 μg/kg bw/day), respectively. Toddlers (0.258 μg/kg bw/day) had the highest median EDI indoor dust, which was 2 to 5 times greater than the EDI indoor dust calculated for other age groups (the range of median values: 0.044 to 0.127 μg/kg bw/day). Contribution of indoor dust to EDItotal was 26%, 28%, and 7% for toddlers, children, and adults, respectively.

Samples represented by semifinished and finished cheeses, swabs from the equipment and brines from the salting step, were subjected to analysis by using traditional and molecular methods, represented mainly by quantitative PCR. Comparing the results obtained by the application of the two approaches used, it became evident how traditional microbiological analysis underestimated the presence of L. monocytogenes in the dairy plant. Especially samples of the brines and the equipment swabs were positive only with qPCR. For some equipment swabs it was possible to detect a load of 10(4)-10(5) cfu/cm(2), while the modified ISO method employed gave negative results both before and after the enrichment step. The evidences collected during the first sampling year, highlighting a heavy contamination of the brines and of the equipment, lead to the implementation of specific actions that decreased the contamination in these samples during the 2008 campaign. However, no reduction in the number of L. monocytogenes positive final products was observed, suggesting that a more strict control is necessary to avoid the presence of the pathogen. All the isolates of L. monocytogenes were able to attach to abiotic surfaces, and, interestingly, considering the results obtained from their molecular characterization it became evident how strains present in the brines, were genetically connected with isolates from the equipment and from the final product, suggesting a clear route of contamination of the pathogen in the dairy plant. This study underlines the necessity to use appropriate analytical tools, such as molecular methods, to fully understand the spread and persistence of L. monocytogenes in food producing companies."

Although milk can contain a full range of organisms classified as microbes (i. e. , bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoans), with few exceptions (e. g. , phages that affect fermentations, fungal spoilage organisms, and, to a lesser extent, the protozoan pathogens Cryptosporidium and Giardia) dairy microbiology to date has focused predominantly on bacteria. Between 1917 and 2017, our understanding of the microbes present in milk and the tools available for studying those microbes have changed dramatically. Improved microbiological tools have enabled enhanced detection of known microbes in milk and dairy products and have facilitated better identification of pathogens and spoilage organisms that were not known or well recognized in the early 20th century. Starting before 1917, gradual introduction and refinement of pasteurization methods throughout the United States and many other parts of the world have improved the safety and quality of milk and dairy products. In parallel to pasteurization, others strategies for reducing microbial contamination throughout the dairy chain (e. g. , improved dairy herd health, raw milk tests, clean-in-place technologies) also played an important role in improving microbial milk quality and safety. Despite tremendous advances in reducing microbial food safety hazards and spoilage issues, the dairy industry still faces important challenges, including but not limited to the need for improved science-based strategies for safety of raw milk cheeses, control of postprocessing contamination, and control of sporeforming pathogens and spoilage organisms."

However, the epidemiology of Q fever/coxiellosis in Brazil is still poorly understood. Accordingly, there have been few studies investigating the presence of Coxiella burnetii in dairy products around the world, especially in Brazil, where consumption of fresh cheese made from raw-milk is very high. This study was a random survey to assess the prevalence of C. burnetii by PCR in traditional Minas artisanal cheese from the Serro microregion, Brazil, which is manufactured from bovine raw-milk. DNA extracted from 53 cheese samples were analyzed by nested PCR with C. burnetii-specific primers and the products confirmed by DNA sequencing. Out of the 53 cheese samples five (9.43%) were C. burnetii DNA-positive, each coming from one of the respective randomly selected manufacturing agroindustries. Based on our results, it is estimated that 1.62 tons/day of ready-to-eat cheese made from raw-milk from a total of 16.2 tons produced daily in the study region are contaminated with C. burnetii. To our knowledge, this is the first report of highly heat-resistant zoonotic pathogen in raw-milk Brazilian artisanal cheese. This food safety hazard has been completely neglected in ready-to-eat raw-milk Brazilian artisanal cheese and could imply potential threats to consumers, since C. burnetii survives in artisanal cheese submitted to long ripening periods. Thus, this work established random and representative baseline prevalence of C. burnetii in this food product in Brazil. Further epidemiological studies, monitoring trends and setting control targets are warranted. Finally, these results point out the importance of including C. burnetii in animal and public health surveillance programs."

To accomplish this, a large-scale molecular epidemiological analysis of Campylobacter jejuni circulating within the study location was completed. In excess of 8000 isolates of C. jejuni from people (n = 2548 isolates), chickens (n = 1849 isolates), cattle (n = 2921 isolates), and water (n = 771 isolates) were subtyped. In contrast to previous studies, the source attribution estimates of clinical cases attributable to cattle vastly exceeded those attributed to chicken (i. e. , three- to six-fold). Moreover, cattle were often colonized by C. jejuni (51%) and shed the bacterium in their feces. A large proportion of study isolates were found in subtypes primarily associated with cattle (46%), including subtypes infecting people and those associated with chickens (19%). The implication of cattle as a primary amplifying reservoir of C. jejuni subtypes in circulation in the study location is supported by the strong cattle association with subtypes that were found in chickens and in people, a lack of evidence indicating the foodborne transmission of C. jejuni from beef and dairy, and the large number of cattle and the substantial quantities of untreated manure containing C. jejuni cells. Importantly, the evidence implicated cattle as a source of C. jejuni infecting people through a transmission pathway from cattle to people via the consumption of chicken. This has implications for reducing the burden of campylobacteriosis in the study location and elsewhere."

The present investigation focused on the iodine level of feed and milk in German feeding practice in comparison with the results of previous milk monitoring and dose-response experiments with dairy cows. In 73 samples of straight feedstuffs (41 concentrates, 32 silages prepared from grass or green maize) and a total of 83 vitamin mineral premixes and compound feeds, respectively, the iodine content was determined and along with the expected daily iodine intake of cows. In six Thuringian cow herds, the total cow diets (51 total mixed rations, TMR) as well as the bulk milk (n=77) were analysed for iodine. Cereal and legume grains and extracted meals from oilseeds had very low native iodine contents at<9-43μg iodine/kg dry matter (DM). Silages showed higher contents than the concentrates. In grass silage, the median amounted to 173μg iodine/kg DM. The significant relationship between the silages' ash and iodine content indicates contamination of grass during harvesting by soil. With regard to supplements, dairy cows received via premixes a mean of 1.2mg iodine/kg diet DM and this was in the magnitude of 0.8mg iodine/kg DM determined in TMR on farm. However, the resulting mean milk concentration of 105μg iodine/kg, median 100μg/kg, is only a half of that in dose-response experiments with 200μg iodine/kg milk at 1mg iodine/kg cow feed DM. The decrease of iodine transfer into the mammary gland and milk is caused by rapeseed meal (RSM) with the glucosinolates and their degradation compounds, e. g. isothiocyanates. By compensating for the iodine antagonist effects of diets containing RSM, more iodine should be added. Twice the current mean feed iodine supplement would optimize the contribution of animal-source food to the human iodine supply in Germany."

Infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria present treatment option challenges and are often associated with heightened severity of infection. Antimicrobial use (AMU) in human and animal health is a main driver for the development of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Increasing levels of AMU and the development and spread of AMR in food-producing animals, especially in poultry and swine production, has been identified as a food safety risk, but dairy production systems have been less studied. A number of farm management practices may impact on animal disease and as a result can influence the use of antimicrobials and subsequently AMR prevalence. However, this relationship is multifactorial and complex. Several AMR transmission pathways between dairy cattle, the environment, and humans have been proposed, including contact with manure-contaminated pastures, direct contact, or through the food chain from contaminated animal-derived products. The World Health Organization has defined a priority list for selected bacterial pathogens of concern to human health according to 10 criteria relating to health and AMR. This list includes human pathogens such as the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E), which can be associated with dairy cattle, their environment, as well as animal-derived food products. ESBL-E represent a potential risk to human and animal health and an emerging food safety concern.

The % CV was found in the range of 3.50-15.8% and 1.32-7.98%, respectively, while the % recovery was in the range of 92-104% and 100-103%, respectively. In addition, the indirect ELISA was also used to detect AFM1 fortified in processed milk samples. The % CV and % recovery values were in the ranges of 0.1-33.0% and 91-109%, respectively. Comparison analysis between the indirect ELISA and high performance liquid chromatography was also performed and showed a good correlation with the R2 of 0.992 for the concentration of 0.2-5.0 ng/mL. These results indicated that the developed MAb and ELISA could be used for detection of AFM1 in milk samples."

In the last years, an increasing number of STEC infections associated with the consumption of raw and pasteurized milk cheese have been reported, contributing to raise the public awareness. The aim of this study is to evaluate the main genomic features of STEC strains isolated from a semi-hard raw milk cheese, focusing on their pathogenic potential. The analysis of 75 cheese samples collected during the period between April 2019 and January 2020 led to the isolation of seven strains from four stx-positive enrichment. The genome investigation evidenced the persistence of two serotypes, O174:H2 and O116:H48. All strains carried at least one stx gene and were negative for eae gene. The virulence gene pattern was homogeneous among the serogroup/ST and included adherence factors (lpfA, iha, ompT, papC, saa, sab, hra, and hes), enterohemolysin (ehxA), serum resistance (iss, tra), cytotoxin-encoding genes like epeA and espP, and the Locus of Adhesion and Autoaggregation Pathogenicity Islands (LAA PAIs) typically found in Locus of Enterocyte Effacement (LEE)-negative STEC. Genome plasticity indicators, namely, prophagic sequences carrying stx genes and plasmid replicons, were detected, leading to the possibility to share virulence determinants with other strains. Overall, our work adds new knowledge on STEC monitoring in raw milk dairy products, underlining the fundamental role of whole genome sequencing (WGS) for typing these unknown isolates. Since, up to now, some details about STEC pathogenesis mechanism is lacking, the continuous monitoring in order to protect human health and increase knowledge about STEC genetic features becomes essential."

Twenty isolates (11.4%), including all 14 Newport, 3 Dublin, 2 Typhimurium, and 1 Infantis isolate, displayed the typical multidrug-resistant, bla(CMY)-positive (MDR-AmpC) phenotype which included resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamide, and tetracycline, plus resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Five of the MDR-AmpC isolates carried class I integrons (2.8%). Two-enzyme (XbaI and BlnI) pulsed-field gel electrophoresis discerned clades within serotypes and, together with the resistance profiles, identified strains that appeared to have persisted temporally and geographically.

Good hygiene practices are necessary to prevent contamination, but contamination may nevertheless occur at the production site and, not least, at the site of the consumer. In recent years, there has been a growing interest from consumers for ""clean label"" food products, which are natural, less-processed, and free of added, chemical preservatives, and a wish for shelf lives of considerable length in order to minimize food waste. This has sparked an interest in using lactic acid bacteria (LAB) or their metabolites as biopreservatives as a way to limit the growth of spoilage organisms in dairy products. A range of compounds produced by LAB with potential antifungal activity have been described as contributing factors to the inhibitory effect of LAB. More recently, growth inhibition effects caused by specific competitive exclusion have been elucidated. It has also become clear that the sensitivity toward both individual antifungal compounds and competition mechanisms differ among molds. In this review, the main spoilage molds encountered in dairy products are introduced, and an overview of the antifungal activity of LAB against different spoilage molds is presented including the main antifungal compounds derived from LAB cultures and the sensitivity of the spoilage molds observed toward these compounds. The recent findings of the role of competitive exclusion with emphasis on manganese depletion and the possible implications of this for biopreservation are described.

Well selection excluded other sources of contamination so that the effect of dairying with border-strip irrigation could be assessed. Groundwater samples (135) were collected, mostly during the irrigation season, with E. coli being detected in 75% of samples. Campylobacter was identified in 16 samples (12%). A risk assessment of drinking water with these levels of Campylobacter was undertaken. A probability distribution was fitted to the observed Campylobacter data and the @RISK modeling software was used, assuming a dose response relationship for Campylobacter and consumption of 1 L/day of water. The probability of infection on any given day in the study area was estimated at 0.50% to 0.76%, giving an estimated probability of infection during the irrigation season of 60% to 75%.

In this study, a cationic hierarchical porous covalent organic frameworks (C-H-COF) were customized via a template-assisted strategy using polystyrene spheres (PS) as sacrificial materials and a post-synthetic modification method. C-H-COF showed good adsorption selectivity for PFASs owing to the dual effects of the full utilization of the internal adsorption sites and electrostatic interaction. The key role of electrostatic attraction in the extraction of PFASs using C-H-COF was further proven by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The maximum adsorption capacity of the C-H-COF for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was 400 mg·g⁻1, which was superior to that of microporous COFs (M-COF) and hierarchical porous COFs without cationic functionalization (H-COF). Accordingly, an analytical method for sensitively detecting five PFASs was established by employing C-H-COF as a dispersive solid phase extraction (DSPE) adsorbent combined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), and the limits of detection were 0.011‒0.29 ng·L⁻1. Moreover, the hierarchical porous structure of the C-H-COF accelerated the mass transfer of analytes so that the extraction process could be completed within 10 min. This method was employed to analyze PFASs in dairy products, in which the ultra-trace levels of analytes were quickly determined with spiked recoveries of 80.1‒112.6%.

For stability assessment of anthocyanins in kefir, the anthocyanins retention was 67% during storage and the half‐life time (t₁/₂) was approximately 27 days. The highest stability in the carbonated water samples was shown in anthocyanin malvidin‐3‐glucoside when they were stored in the dark; the t₁/₂ was almost four times longer than in light exposure. The light had adverse effects on the color of carbonated water while the colored kefir showed physical properties similar to kefir without additives. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The incorporation of synthetic additives to provide coloration in beverages causes harmful effects on human health. Food industries produce a significant amount of waste that causes serious environmental problems and economic losses if they are not utilized efficiently. This study shows a new way to approach the residues of food processing as natural sources of bioactive compounds that could be used as a colorant in food and beverages. The anthocyanins from skin grape applied in food matrices present better thermal stability and higher half‐life time when were stored in the dark.

This could enhance the accumulation of bABCG2 substrates in dairy milk, impacting pesticide risk assessment. We therefore investigated whether 13 commonly used pesticides in Europe are inducers of AhR and bABCG2 activity. MDCKII cells expressing mammary bABCG2 were incubated with pesticides for up to 72 h. To reflect an in vivo situation, applied pesticide concentrations corresponded to the maximum residue levels (MRLs) permitted in bovine fat or muscle. AhR activation was ascertained through CYP1A mRNA expression and enzyme activity, measured by qPCR and 7-ethoxyresorufin-Ο-deethylase (EROD) assay, respectively. Pesticide-mediated increase of bABCG2 efflux activity was assessed using the Hoechst 33342 accumulation assay.

Products consisted of whole milk, nonfat milk, and chocolate milk packaged in gallon, half gallon, quart, pint, and half-pint containers. Samples were collected from both large and small retail stores in urban and suburban locations in four FoodNet cities (Baltimore, Md. , Atlanta, Ga. , St. Paul/ Minneapolis, Minn. , and San Francisco, Calif. ). Samples were prescreened for L. monocytogenes by the AOAC-approved rapid Vitek immunodiagnostic assay system, enzyme-linked fluorescent assay method. Positive prescreening samples were cultured according to the Bacteriological Analytical Manual, enumerated for L. monocytogenes with a nine-tube most-probable-number (MPN) procedure, and confirmed by biochemical characterization. The frequency of isolation of L. monocytogenes in these products was 0% (0 of 1,897) in whole milk, 0.05% (1 of 1,846) in nonfat milk, 0% (0 of 1,669) in chocolate milk, and 0% (0 of 107) in other (reduced fat and low fat) milk samples. Overall, L. monocytogenes was confirmed in only 0.018% of pasteurized milk samples (1 of 5,519). Enumeration of the single confirmed positive nonfat milk sample revealed low-level contamination (<0.3 MPN/g), even when sampled 5 days past the expiration of the sell-by date. The results confirm the low frequency of contamination of pasteurized fluid milk products by L. monocytogenes for products sold in the United States and reaffirm the reduction of contamination frequency of fluid milk by L. monocytogenes when compared with earlier estimates from the U.

Milk samples (10 samples from each of 7 farms) were collected in autumn and winter seasons. The mean contents of protein, fat and ash ranged from 2.14 to 3.28%, 1.52 to 2.01%, and 0.93 to 0.97%, respectively. Of the fungal agents identified, yeasts belonged to Candida spp. (48.2%), Rhodotorula spp. (22.3%) and Trichosporon spp. (13.4%); and moulds belonged to Geotrichum spp. (16.1%). Of the 70 milk samples, 20 (28.6%) samples had AFM₁ in concentrations in excess of the maximum levels specified in European Union (EU) regulations, that is, 50 ng/L. The mean concentration of AFM₁ in milk samples was 45.95 ng/L, and the minimum and maximum levels were 5.19 and 150.17 ng/L, respectively. The mean concentrations of AFM₁ in winter and autumn months were 54.24 and 34.92 ng/L, respectively (p<.05). As contamination of milk with fungi and AFM₁ is a potential risk for human health, raw camel milk should be monitored for their presence. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Having an idea of fungal load and AFM₁ contamination in raw camel milk could be used by food safety organizations to establish regulations for the control of contamination sources. In Iran, there is no study about the incidence of fungal and AFM₁ contaminations in raw camel milk. Our study is the first one in Yazd province, Iran. In the current study, Candida species were the most predominant yeasts in raw camel milk. The mean AFM₁ contamination was 45.95 ± 49.50 ng/L, representing 28.6% samples exceeded the EU accepted limit (50 ng/L). Therefore, feed hygiene control is the first step in preventing the transfer of aflatoxins to human; and continuous monitoring of dairy products will be necessary for evaluation of hygienic managements."

Analysis of nationally consistent measurements from the U. S. Geological Survey's NAWOA program confirms these hypotheses for a substantial range of agricultural systems. Shallow unconfined aquifers are most susceptible to nitrate contamination associated with agricultural systems. Alluvial and other unconsolidated aquifers are the most vulnerable and shallow carbonate aquifers provide a substantial but smaller contamination risk. Where any of these aquifers are overlain by permeable soils the risk of contamination is larger. Irrigated systems can compound this vulnerability by increasing leaching facilitated by additional recharge and additional concentrations of groundwater nitrate than all other agricultural systems, although mean nitrate concentrations in counties with dairy, poultry, cattle and grains, and horticulture systems were similar. If trends in the relation between increased fertilizer use and groundwater nitrate in the United States are repeated in other regions of the world, Asia may experience increasing problems because of recent increases in fertilizer use. Groundwater monitoring in Western and Eastern Europe as well as Russia over the next decade may provide data to determine if the trend in increased nitrate contamination can be reversed. If the concentrated livestock trend in the United States is global, it may be accompanied by increasing nitrogen contamination in groundwater. Concentrated livestock provide both point sources in the confinement area and intense non-point sources as fields close to facilities are used for manure disposal. Regions where irrigated cropland is expanding, such as in Asia, may experience the greatest impact of this practice."

Exposure assessment considered the microbiological status of dairy farms, expected milk contamination, storage conditions from bulk tank to home storage, microbial growth during storage, destruction experiments, consumption frequency of raw milk, age of consumers, serving size, and consumption preference. The differential risk between milk handled under regulation conditions (4°C throughout all phases) and the worst field handling conditions was considered. The probability of Campylobacter jejuni infection was modeled with a single-hit dose-response beta-Poisson model, whereas for HUS an exponential dose-response model was chosen and two probabilities were used to model the higher susceptibility of children younger than 5 years old. For every 10,000 to 20,000 consumers each year, the models predicted for the best and worst storage conditions, respectively, 2.12 and 1.14 campylobacteriosis cases and 0.02 and 0.09 HUS cases in the 0- to 5-year age group and 0.1 and 0.5 HUS cases in the >5-year age group. The expected pediatric HUS cases do not differ considerably from those reported in Italy by the Minister of Health. The model developed may be a useful tool for extending the assessment of the risk of campylobacteriosis and HUS due to raw milk consumption at the national level in Italy. Considering the epidemiological implications of this study, the risk of illness linked to raw milk consumption should not be ignored and could be reduced by the use of simple measures. Boiling milk before consumption and strict control of temperatures by farmers during raw milk distribution have significant effects on campylobacteriosis and HUS and are essential measures for risk management."

The purpose of the study was to determine whether clinical isolates belonged to a specific genetic group, whether links could be made between food groups and clinical cases and whether specific genetic groups were associated with specific food products or processing units. There was great genetic variability among the isolates, which produced a total of 141 RAPD composites based on the RAPD analysis with four primers. The RAPD composites divided in two major clusters and clinical isolates were evenly distributed in both of them. None of the isolates from food products had the same RAPD composite as isolates from human patients, thus, no particular food commodity could be linked to clinical cases. Each food-processing environment was contaminated with more than one RAPD composite and the genetic variability found within each company was, in most cases, of approximately the same magnitude as the variability found when considering all the samples. In each plant, one or a few types persisted over time, indicating the presence of an established in-house flora. Our results indicate that most of the analysed cases of listeriosis were sporadic and, further, that these cases cannot be traced to a few specific food sources.

However, much less is known about the potential carcinogenic impact of a metabolite of AFB1 called aflatoxin M1 (AFM1), which is secreted in milk when dairy animals consume AFB1-contaminated feed. The cancer risk of AFM1 to humans from milk consumption has not yet been evaluated. We sought to estimate the global risk of AFM1-related liver cancer through liquid milk consumption, accounting for possible synergies between AFM1 and chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in increasing cancer risk. We conducted a quantitative cancer risk assessment by analyzing extensive datasets of national population sizes, dairy consumption patterns, AFM1 concentrations in milk in 40 nations, and chronic HBV prevalence. Two separate cancer risk assessments were conducted: assuming a possible synergy between AFM1 and HBV in increasing cancer risk in a manner similar to that of AFB1 and HBV, and assuming no such synergy. If there is no synergy between AFM1 and HBV, AFM1 may contribute ∼0.001% of total annual HCC cases globally. If there is synergy between AFM1 and HBV infection, AFM1 may contribute ∼0.003% of all HCC cases worldwide. In each case, the total expected AFM1-attributable cancer cases are ∼13-32 worldwide. AFM1 exposure through liquid milk consumption does not substantially increase liver cancer risk in humans.

Three different climate models, one aflatoxin B1 prediction model and five different carryover models were used. For this particular case study of East European maize, most of the calculations suggest an increase (up to 50%) of maximum mean aflatoxin M1 in milk by 2030, except for one climate (DMI) model suggesting a decrease. Results from all combinations of carryover and climate models suggest a similar or slight increase (up to 0.6%) of the chance of finding aflatoxin M1 in milk above the EC limit of 0.05 μg/kg by 2030. Results varied mainly with the climate model data and carryover model considered.

New goat meat and milk products are needed to increase demand and meet the diverse tastes of the American public. Despite research progress in control of mohair and cashmere growth, erratic prices and sale of raw materials have contributed to further declines in US production. Innovative and cooperative ventures are needed for profit sharing up to the consumer level. Internal parasites pose the greatest challenge to goat production in humid areas largely because of anthelmintic resistance. Study of alternative controls is required, including immunity enhancement via nutrition, vaccination, pasture management such as co-grazing with cattle, and genetic resistance. Similarly, the importance of health management is increasing related in part to a lack of effective vaccines for many diseases. Nutrition research should address requirements for vitamins and minerals, efficiencies of protein utilization, adjusting energy requirements for nutritional plane, acclimatization, and grazing conditions, feed intake prediction, and management practices for rapid-growth production systems. Moreover, efficient technology transfer methods are needed to disseminate current knowledge and that gained in future research."

This study aimed to quantify total organic carbon (TOC) and total inorganic C losses in runoff after application of dairy slurry, pig slurry, or milk house wash water (MWW) to land and to mitigate these losses through coamendment of the slurries with zeolite (2.36-3.35 mm clinoptilolite) and liquid polyaluminum chloride (PAC) (10% AlO) for dairy and pig slurries or liquid aluminum sulfate (alum) (8% AlO) for MWW. Four treatments under repeated 30-min simulated rainfall events (9.6 mm h) were examined in a laboratory study using grassed soil runoff boxes (0.225 m wide, 1 m long; 10% slope): control soil, unamended slurries, PAC-amended dairy and pig slurries (13.3 and 11.7 kg t, respectively), alum-amended MWW (3.2 kg t), combined zeolite and PAC-amended dairy (160 and 13.3 kg t zeolite and PAC, respectively) and pig slurries (158 and 11.7 kg t zeolite and PAC, respectively), and combined zeolite and alum-amended MWW (72 and 3.2 kg t zeolite and alum, respectively). The unamended and amended slurries were applied at net rates of 31, 34, and 50 t ha for pig and dairy slurries and MWW, respectively. Significant reductions of TOC in runoff compared with unamended slurries were measured for PAC-amended dairy and pig slurries (52 and 56%, respectively) but not for alum-amended MWW. Dual zeolite and alum-amended MWW significantly reduced TOC in runoff compared with alum amendment only. We conclude that use of PAC-amended dairy and pig slurries and dual zeolite and alum-amended MWW, although effective, may not be economically viable to reduce TOC losses from organic slurries given the relatively low amounts of TOC measured in runoff from unamended slurries compared with the amounts applied."

A recently developed rpoB subtyping method was applied to characterize the diversity and phylogenetic relationships among Bacillus and related sporeformers associated with milk processing systems. Milk samples representing the processing continuum from raw milk to pasteurized products were collected from two fluid milk processing plants, held at 6 degrees C up to the code date that had been established by each processing plant (i. e. , either 18 or 21 days), and plated for bacterial enumeration throughout storage. Bacterial colonies selected to represent the visible diversity in colony morphology on enumeration plates were examined further. Among 385 bacterial isolates characterized, 35% were Bacillus spp. , and 65% were Paenibacillus spp. A total of 92 rpoB allelic types were identified among these isolates, indicating considerable diversity among endospore-forming spoilage organisms present in fluid milk systems. Of the 92 allelic types identified, 19 were isolated from samples collected from both processing plants. The same rpoB allelic types were frequently identified in paired raw milk and packaged product samples, indicating that Bacillus and Paenibacillus spp. can enter dairy processing systems through raw milk. Certain subtypes were found exclusively in pasteurized samples, including those that were temporally independent, suggesting the possibility of in-plant sources for these spoilage organisms, including through the persistence of selected subtypes in processing plants. Development of effective control strategies for the diverse array of psychrotolerant endospore-forming organisms that currently limit the shelf lives of high-temperature short-time fluid milk products will require comprehensive, integrated efforts along the entire milk processing continuum."

Even though the PCDD/F level in feed in E2 was satisfied with the EU Regulation (No 277/2012), the TEQ levels in milk and tissues exceeded the European Union maximum level (EU ML) after approximately one-week exposure. The dynamic variation in milk during the initial 20-day exposure was successfully described by a first-order kinetic model. The levels at the plateau period showed a significant linear relationship (p < 0.01, R2 = 0.98) against the intake amounts from feed. Based on modeling, a maximum content was obtained at approximately 0.33 pg TEQ/g in cow feed with 12 % moisture to ensure the milk and meat safety under the current regulatory requirements of EU for cow-origin food. After the cease of exposure, the PCDD/F levels in milk declined below the EU ML within 40 days, while those in meat were still higher than the EU ML over 160 days. In serum, PCDD/Fs detected in E1 showed a similar dynamic variation during the exposure period. Regarding congener profile, higher-chlorinated congeners tended to transfer from feed to feces, whereas lower ones were preferably transferred into milk, which required specific concern about the metabolic effect of PCDD/Fs in large mammals. This study revealed a necessity for re-evaluation of official regulation on pollutants in cow feed and cow-origin food in terms of biotransfer and bioaccumulation."

These sources typically include sewage outfalls, seepage from septic tanks, and urban and agricultural runoff. Shellfish as filter feeders are particularly susceptible to contamination in faecally contaminated waters and a range of microbiological indicators have been developed to assess the levels of contamination and likely risks to public health (Hackney and Pierson, 1994). This paper outlines the application of bacterial source tracking (BST) in a shellfish growing area in part of the Port Stephens estuary along the NSW north coast. The approach is based on the premise that bacterial isolates from different faecal sources will have significantly different resistance patterns to the battery of antibiotics and concentrations tested. Faecal streptococci (FS) were isolated from several possible faecal sources: beef and dairy cattle, chickens and humans. The resistance patterns of these isolates to four different concentrations of four antibiotics were compared to those of FS isolates obtained from samples collected upstream and in the vicinity of the oyster leases. Discriminant analysis was performed using the patterns from the known source isolates and the rate of correct classification was determined for each source. The predictive function of discriminant analysis was then used to determine the most probable source of each of the unknown isolates from Tilligerry Creek, the drainage channels to the estuary, and the shellfish leases. Preliminary results are presented here and suggest that there is no single significant source of faecal contamination, rather there are contributions from a range of sources. The findings may have implications for the ways in which land use activities and catchments are managed in similar estuarine locations with a shellfish industry."

A significant positive correlation was found between the concentrations of perchlorate and iodide in Japanese commercial milk. The concentrations of perchlorate and nitrate-N in water samples analyzed from both countries also showed a significant positive correlation. The exposure estimation revealed that dairy milk provides a greater source for perchlorate and iodide, while water predominantly contributes nitrate-N intake for all age groups in both counties. Infants and children demonstrated the highest estimated perchlorate, iodide and nitrate-N intake on a body weight basis in comparison to other age groups. Therefore, further studies of risk associated with perchlorate may need to reconsider co-existence of iodine and other iodide transport inhibitors in food."

Due to potentially teratogenic and carcinogenic effects of their residues on public health, the use of thyreostats in animal production has been banned in the European Union since 1981. Systematic detection of low concentrations of thiouracil in the urine of livestock in many countries is believed to be of endogenous origin due to the use of Brassicaceae plants in the animal diet. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to determine the effects of diets rich in rapeseed meal on formation of thiouracil in urine and milk of dairy cows. For two weeks three cows were subjected to a diet supplemented with rapeseed at 30%, compared to the control cattle diet which contained up to 11% rapeseed. During the experiment, samples of urine and milk were collected and analysed by LC-MS/MS. The increase and decrease of thiouracil concentration in urine samples in different animals was individual and cyclic. The highest concentration of natural thiouracil determined in urine was 3.61 μg l-1. It has been found that endogenous thiouracil exists in two tautomeric forms. A few days of storage of frozen urine samples affected the stability of natural thiouracil, whereas an acidic medium improved the stability of the compound and its isomer, which remained stable even after two months of storage at temperatures below -18°C. Due to the instability of thiouracil, urine samples upon sampling should be delivered to the laboratory as soon as possible or properly preserved. In milk samples, thiouracil was not found above the decision limit of the applied method of 0.63 μg l-1. Preliminary studies have shown that faecal examination for banned thiouracil can be a complementary test for urine samples, and may be helpful in determining the origin of the compound present in urine."

Cryptosporidiosis has become a concern for dairy producers because of the direct losses due to calves not performing well and the potential for environmental contamination with C. parvum. Identifying modifiable control points in the dynamics of infection in dairy herds will help identify management strategies that mitigate its risk. The quantitative risk assessment approach provides estimates of the risk associated with these factors so that cost-effective strategies can be implemented. Using published data from epidemiologic studies and a stochastic approach, we modeled the risk that C. parvum presents to dairy calves in 2 geographic areas: 1) the New York City Watershed (NYCW) in southeastern New York, and 2) the entire United States. The approach focused on 2 possible areas of exposure--the rearing environment and the maternity environment. In addition, we evaluated the contribution of many risk factors (e. g. , age, housing, flies) to the end-state (i. e. , total) risk to identify areas of intervention to decrease the risk to dairy calves. Expected risks from C. parvum in US dairy herds in rearing and maternity environments were 41.7 and 33.9%, respectively. In the NYCW, the expected risks from C. parvum in the rearing and maternity environments were 0.36 and 0.33%, respectively. In the US scenarios, the immediate environment contributed most of the risk to calves, whereas in the NYCW scenario, it was new calf infection. Therefore, within the NYCW, risk management activities may be focused on preventing new calf infections, whereas in the general US population, cleaning of calf housing would be a good choice for resource allocation. Despite the many assumptions inherent with modeling techniques, its usefulness to quantify the likelihood of risk and identify risk management areas is illustrated."

In this study, samples of cassava, maize, groundnut, beans, soybean, sorghum and milk, and their processed products were collected from local markets in Burundi and Eastern DRC. In order to investigate the levels of aflatoxin, crop samples were analyzed using a single step lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (Reveal Q+), while enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) was used to analyze aflatoxin-M1 in milk, yogurt, and cheese samples.

The resulting qualitative RA was designed to ascertain the risk to human health from the consumption of Swiss dairy products. The products and microbial hazards to be considered in the RA were determined based on a risk profile. The hazards included Campylobacter spp. , Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp. , Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, coagulase-positive staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin. The release assessment considered the prevalence of the hazards in bulk milk samples, the influence of the process parameters on the microorganisms, and the influence of the type of dairy. The exposure assessment was linked to the production volume. An overall probability was estimated combining the probabilities of release and exposure for each combination of hazard, dairy product and type of dairy.

Effects on transporter expression and function of the imidazole fungicide prochloraz, previously reported to influence BCRP in mammary cells, was investigated on transporter expression and function in the two cell lines. Transporters studied were BCRP, MDR1, MRP1, OATP1A5/OATP1A2, OCTN1 and OCT1. Gene expressions of BCRP and OCT1 in murine mammary glands were increased during gestation and lactation, whereas MDR1, MRP1, OATP1A5 and OCTN1 were decreased, compared to expressions in virgins. All transporters measured in mammary glands of mice were detected in bovine mammary tissue and in HC11 cells, while only MDR1 and MRP1 were detected in BME-UV cells. Prochloraz treatment induced MDR1 gene and protein expression in both differentiated HC11 and BME-UV cells and increased protein function in HC11 cells, resulting in decreased accumulation of the MDR1 substrate digoxin. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that murine (HC11) and bovine (BME-UV) mammary epithelial cells can be applied to characterize expression and function of transporters as well as effects of contaminants on the mammary transporters.

Knowledge of microbiota and predominant, technologically important microorganisms is critical in developing products with enhanced quality and safety, as well as sustainable interventions for these products, including Africa-specific starter culture development. This narrative review summarizes current knowledge of technologically-important microorganisms of African fermented dairy products (FDP) and raw milk, taking into consideration novel findings and taxonomy when re-analyzing data of 29 publications covering 25 products from 17 African countries. Technologically-important lactic acid bacteria such as Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (Sii), Lactobacillus spp. and yeasts predominated in raw milk and FDP across Africa. Re-analysis of data also suggests a much wider distribution of Sii and thus a potentially longer history of use than previously expected. Therefore, evaluating the role and safety of African Sii lineages is important when developing interventions and starter cultures for FDP in Africa to enhance food safety and food security. In-depth functional genomics, epidemiologic investigations and latest identification approaches coupled with stakeholder involvement will be required to evaluate the possibility of African Sii lineages as novel food-grade Streptococcus lineage."

Milk contamination can occur at any stage from its way from cow to our tables. Usually milk is pure and sterile when produced in udder of a healthy cow. Like humans, cow are reservoirs of bacteria which are harmless to humans and some cows can harbour few bacteria that are harmful to humans even though they are not harmful to the cow. Milk can be contaminated during or after milking. Also, cow feeds can be contaminated with mycotoxins such as aflatoxins produced by the fungi, Aspergillus flavus. Four types of aflatoxins are known which are; aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, G2. Cows comsuming feeds contaminated with aflatoxin B1 leads to secretion in the milk of aflatoxin M1 and M2 causing aflatoxicosis. Microbial contamination of milk and dairy products is a universal problem and foodborne infections accounting for 20 million cases annually in the world have been identified as an important public health and economic problem in developed as well as developing nations. The main objective of this study was to determine milk microbial quality in Kicukiro district. The specific objectives are to identify bacteria pathogens in milk collected in Kicukiro district, to compare milk quality among sectors of Kicukiro district, to compare milk processed by industries and home-processed milk. The methodology employed in this research was cross-sectional and experimental as the study began with collection of raw data and went through laboratory analysis from July&ndash;August, 2018. The findings showed that 59.56% of the milk fell within Grade I &ndash; Grade III (&lt; 200,000 &le; 2,000,000 cfu/ml) and 40.42 % of the milk samples were not within the acceptable limit of total count quality as per COMESA and EAS, non-lactobacilli and fungi were present in most samples as examined through microscope and no Staphylococcus aureus was present in any sample as examined by catalase and coagulase tests."

Dictionary: {}</s>",{'Food': ['Raw milk']}</s>,"An increasing number of people are consuming raw unpasteurized milk. Enhanced nutritional qualities, taste, and health benefits have all been advocated as reasons for increased interest in raw milk consumption. However, science-based data to substantiate these claims are limited. People continue to consume raw milk even though numerous epidemiological studies have shown clearly that raw milk can be contaminated by a variety of pathogens, some of which are associated with human illness and disease. Several documented milkborne disease outbreaks occurred from 2000-2008 and were traced back to consumption of raw unpasteurized milk. Numerous people were found to have infections, some were hospitalized, and a few died. In the majority of these outbreaks, the organism associated with the milkborne outbreak was isolated from the implicated product(s) or from subsequent products made at the suspected dairy or source. In contrast, fewer milkborne disease outbreaks were associated with consumption of pasteurized milk during this same time period. Twenty nine states allow the sale of raw milk by some means. Direct purchase, cow-share or leasing programs, and the sale of raw milk as pet food have been used as means for consumers to obtain raw milk. Where raw milk is offered for sale, strategies to reduce risks associated with raw milk and products made from raw milk are needed. Developing uniform regulations including microbial standards for raw milk to be sold for human consumption, labeling of raw milk, improving sanitation during milking, and enhancing and targeting educational efforts are potential approaches to this issue. Development of pre- and postharvest control measures to effectively reduce contamination is critical to the control of pathogens in raw milk. One sure way to prevent raw milk-associated foodborne illness is for consumers to refrain from drinking raw milk and from consuming dairy products manufactured using raw milk."

The study used an export/import database which provided imports data collected from the Pakistan Customs Authority. We investigated imports of 7 CIA-HtP and various poultry feed additives/growth promoters (FAs/GPs) identified from a survey of 10 poultry and dairy farms in Punjab province in Pakistan and a previously published study, over a three-year period of 2017-2019.

S. aureus that are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics (especially cefoxitin) are referred to as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The spread of MRSA cannot be separated from sanitation management during milking; it can originate from milk collected from the udder or from the hands of farmers during the milking process. The purpose of this study was to examine the level of MRSA contamination in dairy cow's milk and farmer's hand. Methods: A total of 109 samples of dairy cow's milk and 41 samples of farmer's hand swabs were collected at a dairy farm in Probolinggo, East Java, Indonesia. Samples were cultured and purified using mannitol salt agar (MSA). The profile of S. aureus resistance was established by disk diffusion test using a disk of beta-lactam antibiotics, namely oxacillin and cefoxitin. Results: The S. aureus isolates that were resistant to oxacillin and cefoxitin antibiotics were then tested for oxacillin resistance screening agar base (ORSAB) as a confirmation test for MRSA identity. S. aureus isolates suspected to be MRSA were then tested genotypically by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to detect the presence of the mecA gene. The results of the isolation and identification found 80 isolates (53.33%) of S. aureus. The results of the resistance test found that 42 isolates (15%) of S. aureus were resistant to oxacillin and 10 isolates (12.5%) were resistant to cefoxitin. The ORSAB test found as many as 20 isolates (47.62%) were positive for MRSA. In PCR testing to detect the presence of the mecA gene, three isolates (30%) were positive for the mecA gene. Conclusions: This study shows that several S. aureus isolates were MRSA and had the gene encoding mecA in dairy farms."

PA levels in the plant materials were 3767, 2792 and 1674 µg g-1 respectively. Feed intake, milk yield and several blood parameters indicative for liver function were not influenced by the treatment. When fed ragwort, increased levels of PAs were detected in the milk, in particular jacoline and an unidentified cyclic diester, possibly a hydroxylated metabolite from retrorsine. The latter was the most important PA in milk from cows fed common groundsel. For viper's bugloss, echimidine was the most abundant identified PA but in addition several hydroxylated PA metabolites were detected. For ragwort, the overall PA transfer was estimated at 0.05% and 1.4% for jacoline (N-oxide). Transfer rates were similar for viper's bugloss (0.05%) but lower for common groundsel (0.01%). Only a small portion of the administered PAs was quantified in milk, urine and faeces, with an overall balance of 4.5%, 2.9% and 5.8%, for ragwort, common groundsel and viper's bugloss, respectively. Samples taken from the rumen indicated that the N-oxides were converted into the free bases, which was confirmed by in vitro studies with the same plant species incubated with ruminal fluid. These results confirm that the transfer of PAs to milk is relatively low but may be of concern for human health regarding the genotoxic and carcinogenic properties of these compounds. The transfer rate depends on the type of PAs present in the weeds. The incomplete balance of input vs output stresses the need to further investigate the metabolism and the potential transfer of metabolites into edible products."

A population study was performed on 60 strains using distance-based methods such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and the output was analyzed using Structure statistical software (University of Chicago; http://pritch. bsd. uchicago. edu/structure. html ). This Bayesian clustering model tool allows one to assign individuals into a population with no predefined structure. In order to assess partition of genetic variability among isolates, groups obtained by Structure were also investigated using analysis of molecular variance. S. aureus was recovered in 60 out of 78 samples (76.9%) collected from 26 farms. According to PFGE analysis, the strains were divided into 25 different pulsotypes and grouped into two main clusters. Restriction profiles, analyzed by Structure, allowed us to identify two distinct S. aureus genetic groups. Within each group, the strains showed a high coefficient of membership. A great part of genetic variability was attributable to within-groups variation. On the basis of the virulence profile, 45% of the isolates were linked to ""animal"" biovar, while 6.7% could be assigned to ""human"" biovar. Out of 60 strains, 27 were characterized by in vitro production of either enterotoxins A (5.0%), C (38.3%), or D (1.7%).

Further, starlings have been implicated in the spread of bacterial pathogens among livestock. Here, we determined the prevalence, genotypic, and phenotypic properties of Campylobacter isolated from fecal samples of dairy cattle and starlings found on the same establishment in northeastern Ohio. Campylobacter were detected in 83 (36.6%) and 57 (50.4%) out of 227 dairy and 113 starling fecal samples, respectively. Specifically, 79 C. jejuni, five C. coli, and two other Campylobacter spp. were isolated from dairy feces, while all isolates from starlings (n=57) were C. jejuni. Our results showed that the prevalence of C. jejuni in birds was significantly (p<0.01) higher than that in dairy cattle. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis showed that C. jejuni were genotypically diverse and host restricted; however, there were several shared genotypes between dairy cattle and starling isolates. Likewise, many shared clonal complexes (CC) between dairy cattle and starlings were observed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis. As in humans, both in cattle and starlings, the CC 45 and CC 21 were the most frequently represented CCs. As previously reported, CC 177 and CC 682 were restricted to the bird isolates, while CC 42 was restricted to dairy cattle isolates. Further, two new sequence types (STs) were detected in C. jejuni from dairy cattle. Interestingly, cattle and starling C. jejuni showed high resistance to multiple antimicrobials, including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, and gentamicin. In conclusion, our results highlight starlings as potential reservoirs for C. jejuni, and they may play an important role in the epidemiology of clinically important C. jejuni in dairy population."

Reasons cited by former vegetarians for resuming omnivorous diets included: not feeling healthy, concern about their nutritional status, a change in living situation, or missing the taste of meat. Perceptions of meat and dairy products differed significantly by dietary pattern: nonvegetarians and former vegetarians were more likely than current vegetarians to agree with statements inferring positive attributes (eg, nutrient content).

The investigation into local raw milk consumption patterns showed that the proportion of raw milk consumption was 51.6% in people who consume milk. The probability of ingestion of marketed raw milk that failed to meet standards for this group of bacteria was 29.9% and about 652 consumers per day were estimated to ingest contaminated milk.

Moreover, 1 sample was positive concomitantly for M. tuberculosis and M. avium complexes. On risk analysis, no variable was associated with raw milk contamination by M. tuberculosis complex species. However, washing the udders of all animals and drying them with paper towels were weakly classified as risk factors for M. avium contamination. Positive samples were obtained from both animals and bulk tanks, which emphasizes the importance of tuberculosis control programs and provides evidence that milk monitoring can be used as a control practice. Moreover, the findings of this study reinforce the need for awareness of the problems of raw milk consumption among the general population."

It is caused by Brucella spp. , an expanding group of pathogens able to infect various host species. Bovines and small ruminants, which excrete the bacteria in milk and in reproductive discharges, are major sources of infection for humans and other animals. Contact with contaminated animals and consumption of unpasteurized dairy products are the main routes for human infection. In spite of the considerable progress of knowledge gained and success achieved in brucellosis control in the developed world, this disease continues to be an important burden in the Middle East (ME). Common risk factors implicated in the difficulty and complexity of brucellosis control within the region include (1) social and political instabilities; (2) insufficient resources and infrastructure for appropriate diagnosis, reporting, and implementation of control measures; (3) variation of livestock husbandry systems and their commingling with other livestock and wildlife; and (4) traditional cultural practices, including consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. Development of core interdisciplinary competencies is required for a true One Health-based endeavor against the disease. National awareness and educational programs addressing all population sectors from consumers to decision-makers seem to be the next logical, sustainable, and economically viable approach toward improving disease status in this region. In the present review, we describe the current situation of brucellosis in the ME, focusing on the major limitations and shortcomings regarding disease control. We propose a regional approach toward public awareness of brucellosis as the first step in mitigating the disease and discuss the potential benefits, and components of such a strategy, which can further be used as a model for other endemic zoonotic diseases."

A common form of EMA, undeclared substitution with alternative ingredients, is usually a health concern because of allergen labeling requirements. As demonstrated by the nearly 300,000 illnesses in China from melamine adulteration of infant formula, EMA also has the potential to result in serious public health consequences. Furthermore, EMA incidents reveal gaps in quality assurance testing methodologies that could be exploited for intentional harm. In contrast to foodborne disease outbreaks, EMA incidents present a particular challenge to the food industry and regulators because they are deliberate acts that are intended to evade detection. Large-scale EMA incidents have been described in the scientific literature, but smaller incidents have been documented only in media sources. We reviewed journal articles and media reports of EMA since 1980. We identified 137 unique incidents in 11 food categories: fish and seafood (24 incidents), dairy products (15), fruit juices (12), oils and fats (12), grain products (11), honey and other natural sweeteners (10), spices and extracts (8), wine and other alcoholic beverages (7), infant formula (5), plant-based proteins (5), and other food products (28). We identified common characteristics among the incidents that may help us better evaluate and reduce the risk of EMA. These characteristics reflect the ways in which existing regulatory systems or testing methodologies were inadequate for detecting EMA and how novel detection methods and other deterrence strategies can be deployed. Prevention and detection of EMA cannot depend on traditional food safety strategies. Comprehensive food protection, as outlined by the Food Safety Modernization Act, will require innovative methods for detecting EMA and for targeting crucial resources toward the riskiest food products."

Probabilistic calculations of prenatal exposure were estimated by integrated external and internal dosimetry modelling, physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, using a Monte-Carlo simulation. Physical characteristic data from the cohort, along with food intake information from the questionnaires (concentrations of BPA and DEHP in different food categories and the range of the different food ratios), were used to estimate the value of the total dietary intake for the Tarragona pregnancy cohort. The major contributors to the total dietary intake of BPA were canned fruits and vegetables, followed by canned meat and meat products. In turn, milk and dairy products, followed by ready to eat food (including canned dinners), were the most important contributors to the total dietary intake of DEHP. Despite the dietary variations among the participants, the intakes of both chemicals were considerably lower than their respective current tolerable daily intake (TDI) values established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Internal dosimetry estimates suggest that the plasma concentrations of free BPA and the most important DEHP metabolite, mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), in pregnant women were characterized by transient peaks (associated with meals) and short half-lives (< 2h). In contrast, fetal exposure was characterized by a low and sustained basal BPA and MEHP concentration due to a lack of metabolic activity in the fetus.

The demand for point-of-care testing, able to distinguish molecular signatures with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity has been significantly increasing. This new requirement relies on the on-site detection and monitorization of molecular signatures suitable for the surveillance of food production and processing. The widespread use of antibiotics has contributed to disease control of livestock but has also created problems for the dairy industry and consumers. Its therapeutic and subtherapeutic use has increased the risk of contamination in milk in enough concentrations to cause economic losses to the dairy industry and have a health impact in highly sensitive individuals. This study focuses on the development of a simple Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) method for fast high throughput screening of tetracycline (TET) in milk. For this, we integrate a paper-based low-cost, fully recyclable and highly stable SERS platform, with a minimal sample preparation protocol. A two-microliter sample of milk solutions spiked with TET (from 0.01 to 1000 ppm) is dried on a silver nanoparticle coated cardboard substrate and measured via a Raman spectrophotometer. The SERS substrate showed to be extremely stable with a shelf life of several months. A global spectrum principal component analysis approach was used to test all the detected vibrational modes and their correlation with TET concentration. Peak intensity ratios (455 cm-1/1280 cm-1 and 874 cm-1/1397 cm-1) were found to be correlated with TET concentrations in milk, achieving a sensitivity as low as 0.1 ppm.

Healthy dairy and beef cattle are a major reservoir of a diverse group of STEC that infects humans through contamination of food and water, as well as through direct contact. Infection of humans by STEC may result in combinations of watery diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Systems of serotyping, subtyping, and virulence typing of STEC are used to aid in epidemiology, diagnosis, and pathogenesis studies. Severe disease and outbreaks of disease are most commonly due to serotype O157:H7, which, like most other highly pathogenic STEC, colonize the large intestine by means of a characteristic attaching and effacing lesion. This lesion is induced by a bacterial type III secretion system that injects effector proteins into the intestinal epithelial cell, resulting in profound changes in the architecture and metabolism of the host cell and intimate adherence of the bacteria. Severe disease in the form of bloody diarrhea and the hemolytic uremic syndrome is attributable to Shiga toxin (Stx), which exists as 2 major types, Stx1 and Stx2. The stx genes are encoded on temperate bacteriophages in the chromosome of the bacteria, and production and release of the toxin are highly dependent on induction of the phages. Regulation of the genes involved in induction of the attaching and effacing lesion, and production of Stx is complex. In addition to these genes that are clearly implicated in virulence, there are several putative virulence factors. A major public health goal is to prevent STEC-induced disease in humans. Studies aimed at understanding factors that affect carriage and shedding of STEC by cattle and factors that contribute to development of disease in humans are considered to be important in achieving this objective."

MAP is globally impacting animal health and imparting significant economic burden to animal agriculture. Confounding the management of Johne's disease is that animals are typically infected as calves and while commonly not manifesting clinical disease for years, they shed MAP in their milk and feces in the interval. This has resulted in a ""don't test, don't tell"" scenario for the industry resulting in greater prevalence of Johne's disease; furthermore, because MAP survives pasteurization, the contaminated food supply provides a source of exposure to humans. Indeed, greater than 90% of dairy herds in the US have MAP-infected animals within the herd. The same bacterium, MAP, is the putative cause of Crohn's disease in humans. Countries historically isolated from importing/exporting ruminant animals and free of Johne's disease subsequently acquired the disease as a consequence of opening trade with what proved to be infected animals. Crohn's disease in those populations became a lagging indicator of MAP infection. Moreover, MAP is associated with an increasingly long list of human diseases. Despite MAP scientists entreating regulatory agencies to designate MAP a ""zoonotic agent,"" it has not been forthcoming.

Multiple places may contribute to the mishandling in any outbreak. The method of processing include all sorts of processing operations. The method of preparation is classified into the following food service systems: raw unaltered foods, assembled/prepare serve, cook-serve, cook hold-hot, cook chill serve, cook chill reheat, and acidify serve. The contributory factors are situations or operations that allow contamination of foods and survival and/or proliferation of the etiologic agents in the foods.

Hybridization data were analyzed by a two-component mixture model that estimates the probability of any given gene to be either present or absent in the strains. A total of 78 genes were found to be variable, as they were absent in at least one isolate. Most of the variable genes were clustered in regions that, in the published V583 sequence, related to prophages or mobile genetic elements. The variable genes were distributed in three main groups: (i) genes equally distributed between clinical and dairy food isolates, (ii) genes absent from dairy food-related isolates, and (iii) genes present in MMH594 and V583 strains only. Further analysis of the distribution of the last gene group in 70 other isolates confirmed that six of the probed genes were always absent in dairy food-related isolates, whereas they were detected in clinical and/or commensal isolates. Two of them corresponded to prophages that were not detected in the cognate isolates, thus possibly extending the number of genes absent from dairy food isolates.

This study reviewed research studies on S. aureus in milk and dairy products worldwide published before October 2021 in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science to estimate the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, and enterotoxin genes using a meta-analysis method. In addition, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis and regression analysis were conducted to explore the sources of the heterogeneity. The results showed that 140 eligible studies were published between 1992 and 2021. In raw milk, the prevalence (33.36%, 95% CI: 27.18-39.84%) was higher than that in dairy products and pasteurized milk, while it decreased over the publication period (P = 0.02). Subgroup analysis showed that the prevalence of S. aureus isolated from dairy plants was higher than that isolated from farms and retail markets. Among the 12 antibiotics, the resistance rates of penicillin (73.85%, 95% CI: 67.05-80.17%) and ampicillin (59.63%, 95% CI: 47.31-71.41%) were the highest, and the antibiotic resistance of ampicillin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol increased over time (P < 0.05).

By using a selective 30-min heat treatment at 100 degrees C, 17 Belgian dairy farms were screened to evaluate the presence, sources, and nature of potentially highly heat-resistant spores in raw milk. High numbers of these spores were detected in the filter cloth of the milking equipment and in green crop and fodder samples. About 700 strains were isolated after the selective heating, of which 635 could be screened by fatty acid methyl ester analysis. Representative strains were subjected to amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, percent G+C content, and DNA-DNA reassociations for further identification. The strain collection showed a remarkable diversity, with representatives of seven aerobic spore-forming genera. Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus pallidus were the most predominant species overall. Twenty-three percent of the 603 spore-forming isolates proved to belong to 18 separate novel species. These findings suggest that the selective heating revealed a pool of unknown organisms with a higher heat-resistant character. This study showed that high spore counts can occur at the dairy farm and that feed and milking equipment can act as reservoirs or entry points for potentially highly heat-resistant spores into raw milk. Lowering this spore load by good hygienic measures could probably further reduce the contamination level of raw milk, in this way minimizing the aerobic spore-forming bacteria that could lead to spoilage of milk and dairy products.

The conventional Microbial Risk Assessment (MRA) investigations require prior knowledge of process flow, exposure, and hazard assessment throughout the supply chain. These data are often generated using conventional microbiological approaches based either on shelf-life studies or specific spoilage organisms (SSOs), frequently overlooking crucial information such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR), biofilm formation, virulence factors and other physiological variations coupled with bio-chemical characteristics of food matrix. Additionally, the microbial risks in food are diverse and heterogenous, that might be an outcome of growth and activity of multiple microbial populations rather than a single species contamination. The uncertainty on the microbial source, time as well as point of entry into the food supply chain poses a constraint to the efficiency of preventive approaches and conventional MRA. In the last few decades, significant breakthroughs in molecular methods and continuously progressing bioinformatics tools have opened up a new horizon for risk analysis-based approaches in food safety. Real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and kit-based assays provide better accuracy and precision with shorter processing time. Despite these improvements, the effect of complex food matrix on growth environment and recovery of pathogen is a persistent problem for risk assessors. The dairy industry is highly impacted by spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.

Bacterial numbers were generally very low (<100 cfu/m(3) of air) during the different steps of milk powder production. Elevated bacterial concentrations (with mean values of 391 ± 142 and 179 ± 33 cfu/m(3) of air during winter and summer sampling, respectively; n=15) occurred mainly in the ""logistics area,"" where products in closed tins are packed in secondary packaging material and prepared for shipping. However, total bacterial counts at the outdoor site varied, with a 5- to 6-fold higher concentration observed in winter compared with summer. Twenty-five gram-positive and gram-negative genera were identified as part of the airborne microflora, with Bacillus and Staphylococcus being the most frequent genera identified. Overall, the culturable microflora community showed a composition typical and representative for the specific location. Bacterial counts were highly correlated with total airborne particles in the size range 1 to 5 µm, indicating that a simple surveillance system based upon counting of airborne particles could be implemented. The data generated in this study could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the dairy plant's sanitation program and to identify potential sources of airborne contamination, resulting in increased food safety."

Analyses of NIST and BCR reference materials demonstrated the accuracy of this technique. The highest copper levels were found in dried fruit and legumes, followed by organ meats, molluscs and crustaceans, cephalopods, cereals and sausages, respectively. In cereals, legumes and fruit, copper levels increased significantly with increasing levels of protein and decreasing carbohydrate content (p < 0.001). In meat and meat by-products, copper concentrations found in organ meats were significantly higher (p < 0.01). In fresh fish products, copper levels in shellfish were significantly higher than those measured in fish (p < 0.001). In vegetables, the copper concentrations found in mushrooms were significantly higher (p < 0.005). Mean copper concentrations analysed in cheese were statistically higher than those determined in other dairy products (p < 0.01). In beverages, copper levels determined in rum and juices were significantly higher (p < 0.001). Beverages for which a vegetable component was directly used in their manufacturing process (juices, wines and beers) had statistically higher copper levels when compared with fresh drinks. The daily dietary intake (DDI) of copper in the Andalusian diet was 1979 mug day(-1) per person. Cereals, meat, meat by-products and vegetables are the food categories that are the main source of copper in the daily diet. Taking into account the dietary reference intakes and upper levels (900 and 10, 000 mug Cu day(-1) for healthy adults, respectively), the mean copper DDI found indicate that for most of healthy adult individuals from the area, no adverse effects occur in relation to copper nutrition (deficiency or toxicity). Potable waters supplied 53 mug day(-1), which constitutes on average 0.025% of the maximum tolerable daily intake of this element set by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee."

The objectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of staphylococcal enterotoxin (se) genes in Staphylococcus aureus from raw cow's milk and milk products and to assess their genetic background with the spa typing method. Of the 549 samples (297 bulk milk and 162 milk product samples) collected from Tigray region, Northern Ethiopia, 160 (29.1%) were positive for S. aureus, of which 82 (51%) were found to harbor se genes by a modified multiplex PCR. Nine se genes were identified: sea (n = 12), seb (n = 3), sec (n = 3), sed(n = 4), seg (n = 49), seh (n = 2), sei (n = 40), sej (n = 1), and tsst-1 (n = 24). The classical type of genes accounted for 27%. Of the 82 enterotoxigenic isolates, 41.5 and 12.4% harbored two or more se genes, respectively. The highest gene association was observed between sei and seg, whereas sea and seb were always found together with the new types of se genes. Altogether, 18 genotypes of toxin genes were identified, and 33% of the samples contained > 5 log CFU ml(-1) S. aureus. spa typing identified 22 spa types and three novel spa sequences, which showed the high genetic diversity of the isolates. No apparent relationship was observed between spa type and se genes. Of the 25 spa types, 13 (52%) were from raw milk, 3 (12%) from milk products, and 9 (36%) from both types of sample. Types t314 (20.7%,n = 17), t458 (18.3%, n = 15), and t6218 (9.8%, n= 8) were the most common spa types identified and were widely distributed in three of the eight studied localities. This is the first study from the Tigray region to report the high distribution of enterotoxigenic S. aureus with a diversified genetic background from dairy food. The study may provide valuable data for microbial food safety risk assessment, molecular epidemiology, and phylogenetic studies of S. aureus in Ethiopia."

Based on a logistic regression model, year, month, semester, SCC, TBC, dry therapy, and milk yield significantly contributed to AR variation. High SCC was associated with increased AR violations. When antibiotic dry therapy was implemented, AR occurrence was higher than when this practice was not used. A polynomial monthly distribution throughout the year was observed for AR occurrence; the highest values were in autumn, coinciding with low milk yields per flock. Yearly occurrences drastically diminished from 2004 (1.36%) to 2008 (0.30%), probably as a result of effective educational programs. The mixed-model ANOVA of factors influencing variation in SCC and TBC indicated that year, month, AR, dry therapy group, milking type, and year interactions were significant variation factors for SCC and TBC; mathematical model accounted for 74.1 and 35.4% of total variance for each variable, respectively. Differences in management and hygiene practice caused significant SCC and TBC variations among flocks and within flocks throughout the 5-yr study. Over time, continuously dry treated flocks showed lower logSCC (5.80) and logTBC (4.92) than untreated (6.10 and 5.18, respectively) or discontinuously dry treated (6.01 and 5.05, respectively) flocks. Continuously dry treated flocks had lower AR occurrences than did discontinuously dry treated flocks. As a whole, AR occurrence and SCC and TBC bulk tank milk variables can be used for monitoring mammary health and milk hygiene and safety in dairy sheep throughout time."

This in vitro study aimed to evaluate thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from sheep milk as bio-preservative agents to control L. monocytogenes growth in PDO cheese. Results were compared with those obtained with a commercial protective culture (cPC) composed of a Lactiplantibacillus plantarum bacteriocin producer designed to inhibit L. monocytogenes growth in cheese. The in vitro antilisterial activities of n.74 autochthonous LAB and a cPC were tested against 51 L. monocytogenes strains using an agar well diffusion assay. In addition, 16S rRNA sequencing of LAB isolates with antilisterial activity was conducted and strains of Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. indicus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. sunkii, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Enterococcus faecalis were identified. In this study, 33.6% (74/220) bacterial strains isolated from milk had characteristics compatible with thermophilic LAB, of which 17.6% (13/74) had in vitro antilisterial activity. These results demonstrate that raw sheep milk can be considered an important source of autochthonous thermophilic LAB that can be employed as protective cultures during the manufacturing of Sardinian PDO cheeses to improve their food safety.

The specific and sensitive detection of milk protein residues in foods is needed to protect milk-allergic consumers from exposure to undeclared milk protein residues contained in foods made with milk or milk-derived ingredients or made on shared equipment or in shared facilities with milk or milk-derived ingredients. However, during cheese ripening, milk proteins are degraded by chymosin and milk-derived and bacterial proteases. Commercial allergen-detection methods are not validated for the detection of residues in fermented or hydrolyzed products. The objective of this research was to evaluate commercially available milk ELISA kits for their capability to detect milk protein residues in aged Cheddar cheese. Cheddar cheese was manufactured at a local dairy plant and was aged at 5°C for 24 mo, with samples removed at various time points throughout aging. Milk protein residues and protein profiles were measured using 4 commercial milk ELISA kits and sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE. The ELISA data revealed a 90% loss of milk protein residue signal between the youngest and oldest Cheddar cheese samples (0.5 and 24 mo, respectively). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE analysis showed protein degradation throughout aging, with the highest level of proteolysis observed at 24 mo. Results suggest that current commercial milk ELISA methods can detect milk protein residues in young Cheddar cheese, but the detection signal dramatically decreases during aging. The 4 evaluated ELISA kits were not capable of detecting trace levels of milk protein residues in aged cheese. Reliable detection of allergen residues in fermented food products is critical for upholding allergen-control programs, maintaining product safety, and protecting allergic consumers. Furthermore, this research suggests a novel use of ELISA kits to monitor protein degradation as an indication of cheese ripening."

The rising prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), AmpC beta-lactamase, carbapenemase (CRE) and fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae continually decreases the efficiency of clinically important antibiotics. Moreover, the potential for zoonotic transmission of antibiotic-resistant enteric bacteria increases the risk to public health. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of specific antibiotic-resistant bacteria on human contact surfaces in various animal environments. Environmental surface samples were collected from companion animal shelters, private equine facilities, dairy farms, livestock auction markets and livestock areas of county fairs using electrostatic cloths. Samples were screened for Enterobacteriaceae expressing AmpC, ESBL, CRE or fluoroquinolone resistance using selective media. Livestock auction markets and county fairs had higher levels of bacteria expressing both cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone resistance than did equine, dairy, and companion animal environments. Equine facilities harboured more bacteria expressing cephalosporin resistance than companion animal shelters, but less fluoroquinolone resistance. The regular use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins in livestock populations could account for the increased levels of cephalosporin resistance in livestock environments compared to companion animal and equine facilities. Human surfaces, as well as shared human and animal surfaces, were contaminated with resistant bacteria regardless of species environment. Detecting these bacteria on common human contact surfaces suggests that the environment can serve as a reservoir for the zoonotic transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes. Identifying interventions to lower the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in animal environments will protect both animal and public health."

In total, 195 raw milk samples were collected from 195 dairy farms located in 4 cities of northern China from May to September 2015. Out of 195 samples, 54 (27.7%) were positive for Staph. aureus. Among these 54 samples, 54 strains of Staph. aureus were isolated, and 16 strains were identified as methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. The strains exhibited high percentages of resistance to penicillin G (85.2%), ampicillin (79.6%), and erythromycin (46.3%). Moreover, 72% of the strains showed resistance to more than one antimicrobial agent. Overall, 63% of penicillin-resistant strains possessed the blaZ gene, and 60% of the erythromycin-resistant strains possessed erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), msr(A), or msr(B) genes with 8 different gene patterns. All isolates resistant to gentamicin, kanamycin, and oxacillin carried the aac6'-aph2"", ant(4')-Ia, and mecA genes, respectively. Two tet(M)-positive isolates carried specific genes of the Tn916-Tn1545 transposon. The most predominant virulence genes were sec, sea, and pvl, which encode staphylococcal enterotoxins (sec and sea) and Panton-Valentine leukocidin, respectively. Thirty-two isolates (59.2%) harbored one or more virulence genes. The majority of Staph. aureus strains were multidrug resistant and carried multiple virulence genes, which may pose a risk to public health.

Fecal coliforms in dairy products, such as brukina, wagashi, and yogurt exceeded the specified limit of 10 CFU/mL, while the prevalence of E. coli and K. pneumoniae were 70 and 65%, respectively. Generally, respondents perceived indigenous dairy as unsafe. These perceptions were formed on the basis of visual cues of environmental and personal hygiene. Of the indigenous milk products consumed, brukina, a fermented milk and millet gruel (33%) and wagashie, a soft unfermented cheese (29%), were the most popular. However, only 19% of wagashie and 21% of brukina consumers believed these products were safe. Consistently, the odds of consuming a particular milk product was significantly higher if the consumer believed it was safe. Poor sanitation and unhygienic processing of otherwise healthy but perishable indigenous milk products has justifiably fueled the mistrust of consumers and may hinder potential intervention efforts to increase milk production and consumption in Ghana."

An environmental monitoring program (EMP) is a critical aspect of sustainable and safe food manufacturing used to evaluate the effectiveness of the microbial controls in place. An effective EMP should be based on risk analysis, taking into account previous sampling history to determine the selection of the sampling points, the scope of the test, and the frequency of analysis. This study involved evaluation of the environmental monitoring regime and microbiological status of a medium-sized dairy plant manufacturing food ingredients, e. g. , proteins, milk powders, and dairy fats. The data specific to microbial tests ( n = 3,468), recorded across 124 fixed sampling locations over a 2-year period (2014 to 2015) from air ( n = 1,787) and surfaces ( n = 1,681) were analyzed. The aim of this study was to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the EMP in a select dairy processing plant. The results of this study outline the selection of sampling locations, the scope of the test, and the frequency of analysis. An analysis of variance revealed subsections of the manufacturing areas with high risk factors, especially the packaging subsection specified for bulk packaging, the atomizer, and the fluidized bed. The temporal and spatial analysis showed the potential to reduce or relocate the monitoring effort, most notably related to total coliforms and Staphylococcus aureus, across the dairy plant due to homogeneity across the sampling subsections with little or no deviations. The results suggest a need to reevaluate the current EMP and the corrective action plan, especially with regard to detection of pathogens. Recommendations for optimization of the EMP are presented to assist the dairy industry with reviewing and revising the control measures and hazard assessment with regard to existing contamination issues."

    #Identify the chemical","Diet is considered the main source of Persistent Organic Pollutant (POP) exposure in the general population, although there are still several gaps of knowledge regarding the differential contribution of main food groups. The aim of this study was to identify dietary patterns that contribute to human exposure to organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs). Study population (n=1880, 18-65years old) was recruited during 2009-2010 in all the main geographical areas of Spain. For this work, exposure was estimated by chemical analyses of serum levels of 6 PCBs (n=1880), 13 OCPs (n=934), and 6 (PFASs) in a subsample of 755 (n=755). Dietary habits and covariates were gathered via self-administered questionnaires. Data analyses were performed by means of multivariable linear regression and weighted quantile sum regression. Both the consumption of animal-based and plant-based food were positively associated with the individual concentrations of p,p´-DDE, hexachlorobenzene, and PCB-congeners -138, -153, and-180. The contribution of animal-based products was 2.1-4.0× stronger except in p,p´-DDE, to which both patterns had similar contributions. In PFASs only animal food was positively associated with the exposure levels. The main animal-based contributors to PCB exposure were fish (49-64%) and eggs (19-36%), while OCP concentrations were mainly influenced by dairy products (32-48%) and fish (47-48%). PFOA and PFHxS were mainly explained by cold-meat (34-37%), fish (25-26%), and eggs (19-21%), while PFOS and PFDA were primarily influenced by fish consumption (44-77%). In the case of plant-based items, fruits (25-82%) and vegetables (18-63%) accounted for the majority of the variability of PCB and OCP concentrations. Our results highlight the relevance of dietary POP exposure as well as the need for the consideration of nutritional interventions in public health programs aiming to reduce POP exposure in the general population."

Methods: A total of 13 kinds of dietary samples in Chinese total diet study include cereals, legumes, potatoes, meats, eggs, aquatics, dairies, vegetables, fruits, sugars, beverages and water, alcohols, condiments and their corresponding products. Among them, condiments were used in the preparation of 12 other sample categories; thus, the actual mixed dietary samples of each province covered 12 groups. A total of 240 mixed dietary samples were collected from 20 provinces in China from 2009 to 2013. After the sample extraction and cleanup, dietary samples were analyzed for the residues of fipronil and its metabolites to obtain the contamination levels of fipronil residues using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. The dietary intake of adult residents was estimated based on food consumption of general population of China. Results: Among the 240 dietary samples, the detection rate of fipronil was 10.4% (25 samples), and the detection rates of fipronil metabolites, i. e. fipronil desulfinyl, fipronil sulfone and fipronil sulfide were 20.4% (49 samples), 40.0% (96 samples) and 8.8% (21 samples), respectively. According to the dietary exposure analysis, the average lower and upper dietary exposure levels of fipronil residues in adult residents of China were 11.34 and 12.35 ng·kg(-1)·d(-1), accounting for 5.7% and 6.2% of acceptable daily intake (ADI), respectively. The highest adult dietary intake of fipronil residues was found in Hunan province, with a value of 72.98 ng·kg(-1)·d(-1), accounting for 36.5% of ADI. Vegetables were the main dietary source of fipronil residues, which contributed to 71.0% of the total intake dose. Conclusion: Fipronil residues were detected in varying degrees in dietary samples, yet the health risk caused by the dietary intake of adult residents among 20 provinces of China is low."

Concern has been raised that cows supplemented with rbST are at an increased risk of developing clinical mastitis, which would potentially increase the use of antimicrobial agents and increase human illnesses associated with antimicrobial-resistant bacterial pathogens delivered through the dairy beef supply. The purpose of this study was to conduct a quantitative risk assessment to estimate the potential increased risk of human infection with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and subsequent adverse health outcomes as a result of rbST usage in dairy cattle. The quantitative risk assessment included the following steps: (i) release of antimicrobial-resistant organisms from the farm, (ii) exposure of humans via consumption of contaminated beef products, and (iii) consequence of the antimicrobial-resistant infection. The model focused on ceftiofur (parenteral and intramammary) and oxytetracycline (parenteral) treatment of clinical mastitis in dairy cattle and tracked the bacteria Campylobacter spp. , Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, and Escherichia coli in the gastrointestinal tract of the cow. Parameter estimates were developed to be maximum risk to overestimate the risk to humans. The excess number of cows in the U. S. dairy herd that were predicted to carry resistant bacteria at slaughter due to rbST administration was negligible. The total number of excess human illnesses caused by resistant bacteria due to rbST administration was also predicted to be negligible with all risks considerably less than one event per 1 billion people at risk per year for all bacteria. The results indicate a high probability that the use of rbST according to label instructions presents a negligible risk for increasing the number of human illnesses and subsequent adverse outcomes associated with antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter, Salmonella, or E. coli."

The presence of antibiotic-resistant and heat-resistant bacteria in camel milk has become a potential public health issue. The phenotypic and molecular characterization of methicillin-resistant staphylococcal strains recovered from pasteurized camel milk distributed in retail markets of Saudi Arabia was assessed. A total of 100 samples were collected between March and May 2017. Out of the 20 S. aureus isolates that were recovered from the pasteurized camel milk, 10 were found to be resistant to cefoxitin (30 µg) and, thus, were designated as methicillin-resistant strains. The resistance ratio of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates for a different class of antibiotics was determined by performing the antimicrobial susceptibility test and was estimated to be approximately 60%. Polymerase chain reaction assay was performed to amplify the methicillin-resistant gene mecA, and furthermore, nucleotide sequencing was performed to detect and verify the presence of methicillin-resistant strains. Upon sequencing the putative S. aureus methicillin-resistant strains, we obtained 96 to 100% similarity to the penicillin-binding protein 2a gene (mecA) of the S. aureus strain CS100. Moreover, the 10 methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates were also identified to be heat resistant and were stable at temperatures up to 85°C for 60 s, with 3 isolates being heat resistant even at 90°C for 60 or 90 s. The mean decimal reduction time (D85 value) was 111 s for all the 10 isolates. No difference was observed in the profile of total protein between the 10 methicillin- and heat-resistant S. aureus isolates and the S. aureus strain ATCC 29737, which was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE analyses. Therefore, we could conclude that a relatively high percentage of the tested pasteurized camel milk samples were contaminated with S. aureus (20%) and methicillin- and heat-resistant S. aureus (10%)."

It compares organic vs. conventional food production with respect to parameters important to human health and discusses the potential impact of organic management practices with an emphasis on EU conditions. Organic food consumption may reduce the risk of allergic disease and of overweight and obesity, but the evidence is not conclusive due to likely residual confounding, as consumers of organic food tend to have healthier lifestyles overall. However, animal experiments suggest that identically composed feed from organic or conventional production impacts in different ways on growth and development. In organic agriculture, the use of pesticides is restricted, while residues in conventional fruits and vegetables constitute the main source of human pesticide exposures. Epidemiological studies have reported adverse effects of certain pesticides on children's cognitive development at current levels of exposure, but these data have so far not been applied in formal risk assessments of individual pesticides. Differences in the composition between organic and conventional crops are limited, such as a modestly higher content of phenolic compounds in organic fruit and vegetables, and likely also a lower content of cadmium in organic cereal crops. Organic dairy products, and perhaps also meats, have a higher content of omega-3 fatty acids compared to conventional products. However, these differences are likely of marginal nutritional significance. Of greater concern is the prevalent use of antibiotics in conventional animal production as a key driver of antibiotic resistance in society; antibiotic use is less intensive in organic production. Overall, this review emphasises several documented and likely human health benefits associated with organic food production, and application of such production methods is likely to be beneficial within conventional agriculture, e. g. , in integrated pest management."

The decreasing trend was consistent with the results in other countries; however, the trends in cereals, fruits, and oils were in contrast to previous results reported in other countries. Cereals and fruits are important crops in southern Taiwan, and the local pollution generated by industries or incinerators may seriously affect the distribution of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs.

A stochastic risk assessment involving two field surveys (cattle farms and milk shops) and a medical record survey was conducted to assess the risk of human brucellosis infection through consumption of informally marketed raw milk potentially infected with Brucella abortus in Kampala and to identify the best control options. In the cattle farm survey, sera of 425 cows in 177 herds in the Kampala economic zone were sampled and tested for brucellosis using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CELISA). Farmers were interviewed for dairy information. In the milk shop surveys, 135 milk sellers in the urban areas were interviewed and 117 milk samples were collected and tested using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IELISA). A medical record survey was conducted in Mulago National Referral Hospital for serological test results. A risk model was developed synthesizing data from these three surveys. Possible control options were prepared based on the model and the reduction of risk was simulated for each scenario. Overall, 12.6% (6.8-18.9: 90%CI) of informally marketed milk in urban Kampala was contaminated with B. abortus at purchase and the annual incidence rate was estimated to be 5.8 (90% CI: 5.3-6.2) per 10,000 people. The best control option would be the construction of a milk boiling centre either in Mbarara, the largest source of milk, or in peri-urban Kampala and to ensure that milk traders always sell milk to the boiling centre; 90% success in enforcing these two options would reduce risk by 47.4% (21.6-70.1: 90%CI) and 82.0% (71.0-89.0: 90%CI), respectively.

Monitoring the stages of milk production and checking dairy products for contamination are crucial steps to ensure dairy safety. This study aimed to report the occurrence of thermotolerant coliforms, E. coli, and STEC strains in pasteurized dairy products and to evaluate the antibiotic resistance profiles, serotypes, and characterizations of the STEC isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. We obtained a total of 138 pasteurized dairy products from 15 processing plants in Bahia, Brazil, to examine coliforms, E. coli, and STEC strains. We found that 43% of samples (59/138) contained thermotolerant coliforms, and 30% (42/138) did not comply with Brazilian regulations. Overall, 6% (9/138) were positive for E. coli and 4% (5/138) were positive for STEC. We recovered 9 STEC isolates from pasteurized cream (2/9), Minas Padrão cheese (2/9), Minas Frescal cheese (4/9), and ricotta (1/9). All isolates were stx2-positive, and 2 were eae-positive. All isolates were negative for the ""big 6"" STEC serogroups, belonging instead to serotypes ONT:HNT, ONT:H12, O148:H-, OR:H40, OR:HNT, and O148:HNT. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed 100% genetic similarity among 3 isolates from 2 different samples produced in the same production facility, which may suggest cross-contamination. As well, we found isolates that were 98% similar but in samples produced in different production facilities, suggesting a mutual source of contamination or a circulating strain. Two STEC strains exhibited resistance to streptomycin. Although the isolates presented a low resistance profile and no strain belonged to the ""big 6"" pathogenic group, the circulation of stx2-positive STEC strains in ready-to-eat products highlights the importance of epidemiological surveillance inside the Brazilian dairy chain."

Despite the application of different traditional biocontrol methods in the food industry, food borne disease outbreaks linked to this organism remain. Due to their high specificity, lytic bacteriophages are promising antimicrobial agents that could be utilized to control pathogens in foods. In this study, a novel Escherichia phage, CAM-21, was isolated from a dairy farm environment. CAM-21 showed targeted host specificity towards various serotypes of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, including O157:H7, O26, O103, and O145. Morphological analyses revealed that CAM-21 has a polyhedron capsid and a contractile tail with a diameter of about 92.83 nm, and length of about 129.75 nm, respectively. CAM-21 showed a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of E. coli O157:H7, even at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of as low as 0.001. Phage adsorption and one-step growth analysis indicated that the target pathogen was rapidly lysed by CAM-21 that exhibited a short latent time (20 min). Electron microscopic and genomic DNA analyses suggested that CAM-21 is a lytic phage, classified as a new species in the Tequatrovirus genus of the Myoviridae Family. Based on whole genome sequencing, CAM-21 has a double-stranded DNA with 166,962 bp, 265 open reading frames and 11 tRNA. The genome of CAM-21 did not encode toxins, virulence factors, antibiotic resistance, lysogeny or allergens. Phylogenetic and genomic comparative analyses suggested that CAM-21 is a T4-like phage species. The growth of E. coli O157:H7 was effectively controlled in milk, ground beef and baby spinach at MOIs of 1000 and 10,000. CAM-21 significantly (P ≤ 0.05) reduced the bacterial counts of the treated foods, ranging from 1.4-2.0 log CFU/mL in milk to 1.3-1.4 log CFU/g in ground beef and baby spinach.

By consensus, the groups associated the KN label with individuals concerned about healthy eating and diets, reaffirming the positive commercial positioning of kefir. At the same time, for KCA, a contrasting association was observed. The Conscious group noted the samples better, emphasizing the correlation of KCR (with added fruit residue dye) with an adult female, married and engaged in physical activity. KCN was correlated with a young, single, student and gym or running target group stands out for the Balanced group. The Flexible one also associated the consumption of KCA with a young audience, ranging from athletic to overweight, with a normal to unbalanced diet.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that phage KMSP1 belongs to the Myoviridae family. Phage KMSP1 efficiently inhibited bacterial growth for >28 h post-infection. In addition, phage KMSP1 could infect a broad spectrum of S. aureus strains, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains. Whole-genome sequence analysis showed that KMSP1 is a lytic phage with the absence of genes related to lysogen formation, toxin production, and antibiotics resistance, respectively. In the genome of KMSP1, the presence of putative tail lysin containing a cysteine/histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase (CHAP) domain could be one of the reasons for the effective antimicrobial activity of KMSP1. Furthermore, high stability of phage KMSP1 at temperature ranging from 4 to 55 °C and pH ranging from 5 to 11, suggested its potential use in various food systems. Receptor analysis revealed that KMSP1 utilized cell wall teichoic acid (WTA), one of the major virulence factors of S. aureus, as a host receptor. Application of phage KMSP1 at an MOI of 104 achieved a significant reduction of log 8.8 CFU/mL of viable cell number in pasteurized milk and log 4.3 CFU/cm2 in sliced cheddar cheese after 24 h. Taken together, the strong antimicrobial activity of phage KMSP1 suggested that it could be developed as a biocontrol agent in dairy products to control S. aureus contamination."

Twelve samplings were performed over a period of 16 months, collecting rectal feces from apparently healthy animals in three age groups (calves, heifers, and lactating cows) that were subjected to selective isolation in cefotaxime-containing media. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by broth microdilution for 197 cefotaxime-resistant E. coli (1-3 isolates per age group and sampling date), and 41 of them were selected for long-read whole-genome sequencing. Cefotaxime-resistant E. coli were detected in the five farms, but isolation frequency and resistance profiles varied among farms and age groups. The genetic profiling of a selection of isolates recovered in two of the farms was described in full detail, showing the predominance of a few genomic subtypes of E. coli in one farm (F1) and great variability of strains in another one (F4). Two predominant distinct strains carrying the bla CTX-M-1 gene in IncX1 plasmids successively spread and persisted in F1 over a prolonged period. In F4, 13 different MLST types carrying a high diversity of ESBL-encoding genes in 6 different plasmid types were observed, probably as the result of multiple source contamination events. In both farms, the presence of certain plasmid types with the same repertoire of ARGs in different E. coli STs strongly suggested the occurrence of horizontal transfer of such plasmids among strains circulating within the farms. Considering the public health importance of ESBL-producing E. coli both as pathogens and as vectors for resistance mechanisms, the presence of β-lactamase- and other AMR-encoding genes in plasmids that can be readily transferred between bacteria is a concern that highlights the need for One Health surveillance."

Replicated field plots of loamy or sandy soils were tilled and amended with dairy manure compost (DMC), poultry litter compost (PLC), or no compost (NoC) over two field seasons and noncomposted heat-treated poultry pellets (HTPPs) during the second field season. Plots were inoculated with a three-strain cocktail of rifampin-resistant E. coli (rE. coli) at levels of 8.7 log CFU/m2. Direct plating and most-probable-number methods measured the persistence of rE. coli and Listeria spp. in plots through 104 days postinoculation. Greater survival of rE. coli was observed in PLC plots in comparison to DMC plots and NoC plots during year 1 (P < 0.05). Similar trends were observed for year 2, when rE. coli survival was also greater in HTPP-amended plots (P < 0.05). Survival of rE. coli depended on soil type, and water potential and temperature were significant covariables. Listeria spp. were found in NoC plots, but not in plots amended with HTPPs, PLC, or DMC. Radish data demonstrate that PLC treatment promoted the greatest level of rE. coli translocation compared with DMC and NoC treatments (P < 0.05). These results are consistent with findings from studies conducted in other regions of the United States, and they inform northeast produce growers that composted and noncomposted poultry-based BSAAOs support greater survival of rE. coli in field soils. This result has the potential to affect the food safety risk of edible produce grown in BSAAO-amended soils as a result of pathogen contamination."

For example, the inhibition of the phytopathogens Erwinia amylovara and Xanthomonas campestris has reduced the incidence of diseases such as fire blight in apples and bacterial spot of tomato and peaches. Research on preslaughter treatment of food animals has demonstrated phage control of salmonellosis in chickens, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli infections in calves, piglets, and lambs, and E. coli O157:H7 shedding by beef cattle. Phages have also been applied to control the growth of pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and Campylobacter jejuni in a variety of refrigerated foods such as fruit, dairy products, poultry, and red meats. Phage control of spoilage bacteria (e. g. , Pseudomonas spp. and Brochothrix thermosphacta) in raw chilled meats can result in a significant extension of storage life. Phage biocontrol strategies for food preservation have the advantages of being self-perpetuating, highly discriminatory, natural, and cost-effective. Some of the drawbacks of biopreservation with phages are a limited host range, the requirement for threshold numbers of the bacterial targets, phage-resistant mutants, and the potential for the transduction of undesirable characteristics from one bacterial strain to another. Most research to date has involved experimentally infected plants and animals or artificially inoculated foods.

The authors formed a Scientific Advisory Team (SAT) and developed a tiered ""Metabolic Matrix"" founded in three science-based principles: (1) protect the liver, (2) feed the gut, and (3) support the brain. The Metabolic Matrix categorizes each product and provides the criteria, metrics, and recommendations for improvement or reformulation. Real-time consultation with the KDD Executive and Operations teams was vital to see these procedures through to fruition. This scientific exercise has enabled KDD to lay the groundwork for improving the health, well-being, and sustainability of their entire product line, while maintaining flavor, economic, and fiscal viability. This process is easily transferrable, and we are sharing this effort and its approaches as a proof-of-concept.

In this study, 150 raw buffalo milk samples and 300 pasteurized buffalo milk samples were collected from 3 provinces in southwestern China. The genotype, virulence gene distribution, antibiotic resistance, and biofilm-forming ability of isolates were analyzed. Ninety-six B. cereus strains were isolated and identified: 50 isolates (33.3%) from buffalo raw milk and 46 isolates (15.3%) from pasteurized buffalo milk. These strains were classified into 41 sequence types (ST) and 5 groups, of which ST857 was the predominant ST.

It was then concluded that pasteurization along with homogenization has the most marked effect on the elimination of coliphage MS2 in frozen ice cream. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Enteric viruses have been reported among outbreaks in which a pasteurized dairy product, such as pasteurized milk, yogurt, and cheese, was involved. Since enteric viruses cause acute diseases and are of major public health concern, together with the fact that overall global dairy production and consumption have increased, a more comprehensive analysis of dairy products with a risk of contamination with enteric viruses seems essential. Ice cream is a dairy product for which there is considerable demand in the dairy market. However, there has been a paucity of research on the survival of enteric viruses in ice cream. Therefore, we performed the current study to understand the effects of different treatments on the survival of enteric viruses in traditional ice‐cream."

In that study, mean daily intakes of 11.5 mu g alpha-HCH, 13.8 mu g lindane and 78.4 mu g DDTs were calculated. Livestock meat and dairy products were the prime sources of human dietary exposure to organochlorines, since between 60-85% of the mean daily intakes arose from these particular food classes. These percentages are in accordance with the well documented fact that organochlorines predominantly accumulate in the lipid fractions of the human food chain, by which animal fatty foods have become a major route of exposure for humans (Kannan et al. 1992). Since the current daily intakes of organochlorines in Spain are not known, it was considered necessary to carry out a pesticide survey in several foods that compose an average Spanish diet. To accomplish that, we have determined residues of a list of priority organochlorine compounds in several fatty foodstuffs collected between 1987 to 1990, and prepared in the way in which they would normally be eaten. This study is merely an attempt to estimate the actual intakes, since only a selected number of food classes were investigated and no age-sex group, or seasonal differences were taken into account. In spite of these disadvantages, there are merits to such an approach. Approximate intake figures are available for comparison with toxicologically acceptable intakes and with retrospective studies in Spain and other countries around the world, and they serve to outline the temporal trends in organochlorine contamination that have occurred during the last decades.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate genetic parameters of FA profile predicted by mid-infrared spectroscopy, milk yield, composition, and total and differential somatic cell count. Edited data included 35,331 test-day records of 25,407 Italian Holstein cows from 652 herds. Variance components and heritability were estimated using single-trait repeatability animal models, whereas bivariate repeatability animal models were used to estimate genetic and phenotypic correlations between traits, including the fixed effects of stage of lactation, parity, and herd-test-date, and the random effects of additive genetic animal, cow permanent environment and the residual. Heritabilities and genetic correlations obtained in the present study reflected both the origins of FA (extracted from the blood or synthesized de novo by the mammary gland) and their grouping according to saturation or chain length. In addition, correlations among FA groups were in line with correlation among individual FA. Moderate negative genetic correlations between FA and milk yield and moderate to strong positive correlations with fat, protein, and casein percentages suggest that actual selection programs are currently affecting all FA groups, not only the desired ones (e. g. , polyunsaturated FA). The absence of association with differential somatic cell count and the weak association with somatic cell score indicate that selection on FA profile would not affect selection on resistance to mastitis and vice versa. In conclusion, our findings suggest that genetic selection on FA content is feasible, as FA are variable and moderately heritable. Nevertheless, in the light of correlations with other milk traits estimated in this study, a clear breeding goal should first be established."

Samples were analyzed using a confirmatory UHPLC-MS/MS (Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) method validated for simultaneous detection of 23 mycotoxins in feeds. Overall, mycotoxins assessed were detected across samples with 86% of samples containing at least one mycotoxin above respective decision limits; up to 66% of samples were found to be contaminated with at least three mycotoxins. Findings demonstrated that deoxynivalenol, sterigmatocystin, alternariol and enniatin B were the most common mycotoxins, while low to marginal detection rates were observed for all other mycotoxins with none of the samples containing fusarenon-X, HT-2-toxin and neosolaniol.

Then six phthalate metabolites were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, malondialdehyde (MDA) as an oxidative stress marker was measured. A questionnaire was conducted and information on food consumption and the use of plastic packaging or storage materials was gathered. The concentrations of phthalate metabolites varied substantially by sampling time even within the same subject, but all target metabolites were detected in 100% of the samples with the highest geometric mean of 107 μg/g-creatinine for mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP). Urinary levels of mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), and MnBP among Korean children were 8 and 3 times greater than those reported for US children, but those of monoethyl phthalate (MEP) were about 5 times lower than those of US children. Estimated phthalate intakes were generally in safe range, but in 3-8% of the participating children, the hazard quotients greater than one were noted. Urinary MDA concentrations were significantly associated with several metabolite levels after adjusting covariates in regression model. Consumption of dairy products or meat, and use of a plastic material were significantly associated with the DEHP metabolites or MnBP levels in multivariate model. The results of this study provide evidence of the association between phthalate exposure and oxidative stress especially among the early teenagers, and identified major sources that can be applied to development of management plan for phthalate exposure among children."

Farmer's awareness and voluntary participation in aflatoxin mitigation can be critical in such scenarios. Therefore, the present study was conducted to understand the perceptions of dairy farmers about aflatoxins and link it with aflatoxin mitigation programs on milk in Pakistan. Information was collected from 450 peri-urban dairy farmers in seven cities using questionnaires. Majority (77.9%) of the farmers were aware of the negative impact of moldy feed on animal health. However, only 40.6% of the farmers were aware of the transferability of the toxins from moldy feed to milk. The farmers had almost no awareness of aflatoxins as 95% never heard of the term. After receiving an onsite briefing on effects of the toxin on animal and human health, and its transferability to milk, 98.3% farmers showed willingness to buy aflatoxin-safe feedstuffs, while 88.5% showed willingness to control aflatoxin in milk. Around half of the farmers considered aflatoxin control programs as affordable. On average, farmers agreed to pay 10.1% higher price for aflatoxin certified oilseed cakes. Availability of feedstuffs certified of low aflatoxin content was suggested by 22% of the participants as the critical step in reducing aflatoxins in milk. Other important suggestions included; subsidy on quality feeds (18%), raising awareness (18%), and legislation and monitoring (16%). The present results suggest that the current practice of milk monitoring in the country can yield desirable results only if it is coupled with feed certification programs ensuing availability of aflatoxin-safe feeds. Further, awareness can positively impact participation of producers in aflatoxin control programs. In this regard, awareness about effects of aflatoxins on animal health was found to be a more powerful trigger of voluntary control compared with the awareness of the toxin's transferability to milk."

Here, the bioaccumulation of PFAAs in dairy cows receiving naturally contaminated feed and drinking water was investigated by conducting a mass balance of PFAAs for a herd of dairy cows in a barn on a typical Swedish dairy farm. It was assumed that the cows were able to reach steady state with their dietary intake of PFAAs. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) with 8 to 12 carbons were detected in cow tissue samples (liver, muscle, and blood) at concentrations up to 130 ng kg(-1). Mass balance calculations demonstrated an agreement between total intake and excretion within a factor of 1.5 and consumption of silage was identified as the dominant intake pathway for all PFAAs. Biomagnification factors (BMFs) were highly tissue and homologue specific. While BMFs of PFOS and PFCAs with 9 and 10 fluorinated carbons in liver ranged from 10 to 20, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was not biomagnified (BMF<1) in any of the investigated tissues. Biotransfer factors (BTFs; defined as the concentration in tissue divided by the total daily intake) were calculated for muscle and milk. Log BTFs ranged from -1.95 to -1.15 day kg(-1) with the highest BTF observed for PFOS in muscle. Overall, the results of this study suggest that long-chain PFAAs have a relatively high potential for transfer to milk and beef from the diet of dairy cows. However, a low input of PFAAs to terrestrial systems via atmospheric deposition and low bioavailability of PFAAs in soil limits the amount of PFAAs that enter terrestrial agricultural food chains in background contaminated environments and makes this pathway less important than aquatic exposure pathways. The BTFs estimated here provide a useful tool for predicting human exposure to PFAAs via milk and beef under different contamination scenarios."

Cross‐contamination after milk pasteurization, caused especially by improper handling, is considered the most recurrent source of contamination of dairy products. Therefore, this research aimed to quantify and analyze the presence of coagulase‐positive and coagulase‐negative staphylococci from 104 dairy products samples to identify phenotypically the species and to evaluate the in vitro production of classical enterotoxins (SEA, SEB, SEC, SED and SEE) and the presence of possible coding genes of these enterotoxins. The average staphylococcal count values in different food groups ranged from 3.7 to 6.15 log colony‐forming units (cfu)/g. Among the staphylococcal strains, 74.3% (110/148) were coagulase‐negative Staphylococcus and 25.7% (38/148) were coagulase‐positive Staphylococcus, and 13 species were identified. From the 111 selected isolates, one (0.9%) strain produced enterotoxin, which was identified as S. aureus, coagulase positive, isolated from “Minas” half‐cured cheese, whose count was 6.28 log cfu/g. Contrary to expectations, no coding genes were present in the isolate analyzed. For this research, the analyzed samples showed high staphylococcal concentrations that do not exclude a possible risk of producing the already described enterotoxins.

The hypothetical accident assumes a severe loss of coolant accident at the KNPP coincident with meteorological conditions causing significant radionuclide deposition in the two counties. External doses are estimated from ground deposition and the behaviour of the different population groups, and internal doses from predicted food product activity concentrations and dietary consumption data. Doses are predicted for reindeer keepers and other Norwegian inhabitants, taking account of existing (137)Cs and (90)Sr deposition but not including the remedial effect of any countermeasures that might be used. The predicted doses, arising mainly from radiocaesium, confirm the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme assessment that residents of the Arctic are particularly vulnerable to radiocaesium contamination, which could persist for many years. External doses are predicted to be negligible compared to ingestion doses. Ingestion doses for reindeer keepers are predicted to exceed 1 mSv y(-1) for several decades primarily due to their high consumption of reindeer meat. Other Norwegians would also be potentially exposed to doses exceeding 1 mSv y(-1) for several years, especially if they consume many local products. Whilst reindeer production is the most important exposure pathway, freshwater fish, lamb meat, dairy products, mushrooms and berries are also significant contributors to predicted ingestion doses. Radionuclide fluxes, defined as the total output of radioactivity in food from an area for a unit time, are dominated by reindeer meat.

The bacteriological quality of water especially, water stored in household storage containers in present study area was found to be contaminated with different bacteria indicating potential food safety problem and health risk to the society. In this respect, people handling water should be educated on its proper handling and the risk of contamination during storage. To minimize contamination, materials with narrow mouth and lid should be used. Further study is recommended on the relationship between the bacteriological quality of water and the behavior of water users."

This study was carried out to evaluate the growth and survival of Listeria monocytogenes during manufacture and ripening of Carra cheese. For this purpose, Carra cheese was produced with raw cow's milk inoculated to contain 2.97 log cfu/mL of L. monocytogenes (serovar 4b). Cheese was ripened through storing in an earthenware jug underground for 90 days. Enumeration of L. monocytogenes was made by surface-plating on Oxford agar. The number of L. monocytogenes increased during manufacture and reached 4.89 log cfu/g at the first day of ripening, while it decreased to 4.19 log cfu/g during the first 15 days of ripening and remained constant throughout the rest of the ripening period. The results indicated that L. monocytogenes in Carra cheese manufactured with raw milk was able to survive for 90 days of ripening despite low pH and the presence of a high number of lactic acid bacteria. Thus, Listeria-contaminated Carra cheese could cause serious illness if consumed by susceptible individuals. Behaviour of L. monocytogenes during manufacture and ripening of different types of cheese in several countries should be studied in order to determine the exact risk that this food represents to food safety. Considering the processing method (it was prepared with raw milk) of Carra cheese and that artisan practices may still be applied under potentially poor hygienic conditions in small dairies, there is a potential for L. monocytogenes in the cheese at the time of consumption. Therefore, this study was undertaken to describe what might be expected if Carra cheese is manufactured from contaminated raw milk. In Carra cheese, the pathogen might survive after ripening for 90 days. Therefore, we think that individuals should be consuming Carra cheese with caution. Otherwise, Listeria-contaminated Carra cheese may cause serious and mortal illnesses, even outbreaks, in humans."

A cross-sectional survey was carried out in Andalusia, a region in southern Spain. Blood samples were obtained in a random subsample of 340 subjects. Food consumption was assessed by 48-h recall. Height, weight, skinfolds, waist and hip circumferences were measured. Copper, manganese and selenium were measured in plasma. Information about physical exercise, educational level, alcohol and smoking habits was obtained with a structured questionnaire. Plasma copper was found to be higher in women than among men. Hypocupraemia was found in 4.4% of the population, while 9.7% presented hypomanganesemia. Moreover, 86.5% presented plasma selenium values below 125microg/L (cutoff for optimal glutathione peroxidase activity). No association was found between plasma elements, anthropometric indices and lifestyle factors; there were tendencies, no more. Copper tended to decrease in obese and increase in sedentary, while selenium tended to decrease among smokers. Plasma Cu was positively correlated with the consumption of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Plasma Mn was directly correlated with the consumption of dairy products. Levels of Se were positively correlated with age, the consumption of fruit, vegetables, energy obtained from carbohydrates, and the consumption of fibre, and inversely correlated with the consumption of meat and sweets. Our results provide an estimate of the copper, manganese and selenium status in the adult population of southern Spain. The correlations found for Se suggest that there is a tendency for Se levels to be better maintained among the population that shows a stronger preference for the traditional diet."

Although processing facility-level practices (e. g. , sanitation practices) are known to impact the frequency of postpasteurization contamination (PPC), the relative importance of different practices is not well defined, thereby affecting the ability of facilities to select intervention targets that reduce PPC and provide the greatest return on investment. Thus, the goal of this study was to use an existing longitudinal data set of bacterial spoilage indicators obtained for pasteurized fluid milk samples collected from 23 processing facilities between July 2015 and November 2017 (with three to five samplings per facility) and data from a survey on fluid milk quality management practices, to identify factors associated with PPC and rank their relative importance. This ranking was accomplished using two separate approaches: multimodel inference and conditional random forest. Data preprocessing for multimodel inference analysis showed (i) nearly all factors were significantly associated with PPC when assessed individually using univariable logistic regression and (ii) numerous pairs of factors were strongly associated with each other (Cramer's V ≥ 0.80). Multimodel inference and conditional random forest analyses identified similar drivers associated with PPC; factors identified as most important based on these analyses included cleaning and sanitation practices, activities related to good manufacturing practices, container type (a proxy for different filling equipment), in-house finished product testing, and designation of a quality department, indicating potential targets for reducing PPC. In addition, this study illustrates how machine learning approaches can be used with highly correlated and unbalanced data, as typical for food safety and quality, to facilitate improved data analyses and decision making."

Turkish White Cheese was manufactured by the short-set procedure in pilot-plant-sized vats in a commercial dairy plant. Pasteurized cow's milk was inoculated with L. innocua to a final level of 3.84 (low dose) and 7.12 (high dose) log₁₀ CFU/ml. Bacterial loads of inoculated milk, whey, post-ripened curd and post-salted cheese was determined during processing at 23 °C. Cheeses were stored in 16% saline solution at 4 °C up to 45 days. Samples were taken from each treatment and analyzed at 5-day intervals. Total reduction in viable cell numbers of L. innocua in Turkish White Cheese with each inoculum dose was approximately 2 log₁₀ cycles during the storage period with a first-order-rate of inactivation at 4 °C. Variations in initial number of LAB in L. innocua seeded cheeses after overnight pressing were observed as 3.84, 4.24, 5.85 log CFU/ml at conditions of high-dose, low-dose inoculation of L. innocua and without inoculation as control sample, respectively. The salt concentration, pH, starter activity and storage time were determined to be the main causes of this reduction in LAB. The results had shown that L. innocua was able to survive during the manufacture and storage due to inadequate pasteurization or post-process contamination. The storage period has been defined as a critical control point (CCP) for consumption of Turkish White Cheese and calculated to be at least 90 and 178 days at refrigeration temperature, in low and high inoculum doses of L. innocua, respectively, for a safe consumption. This study, which gives the result of behavior of low and high dose of Listeria monocytogenes during storage as CCP, can even guide the future risk assessment studies on Listeria in Turkish White Cheese."

Cattle slurry, naturally contaminated with MAP, was collected from a dairy herd and divided into 32 glass bottles which were assigned to eight different treatments (control, 3·0% CaO, 0·5% NaOH; 0·087%, 0·11% and 0·14% H2 SO4 ; and 1·0 and 2·5% KMnO4 ). Treated dairy slurry samples were evaluated at 0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 30 and 60-days following treatment application for viable MAP and dairy slurry pH, and in addition temperature in this material was monitored continuously. Bacterial counts were estimated at each sampling time. A Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson mixed model was fitted to assess the effect of each treatment on the count of MAP cells. Model results indicated that only the 3·0% CaO treatment had a statistically important negative effect on MAP counts during the study period. For most treatments, MAP was undetectable immediately after chemical treatment but re-appeared over time, in some replicates at low concentrations. However, in those cases MAP counts were not statistically different than the control treatment. Regarding the fate of the other bacterial populations, the Firmicutes phylum was the dominant population in the un-treated slurry while Clostridia class members were among the most prevalent bacteria after the application of most chemical treatments. Only 3% CaO treatment had a statistically important negative effect on MAP viability in cattle slurry. This study provides evidence of MAP partial control in dairy slurry. This information should be considered as a best management practice to reduce MAP and other pathogens for slurry management on dairy farms."

A total of 52 infant milk, 25 Feta cheese and 32 pasteurized milk samples were randomly selected from the market. The determination of AFM1 was based on indirect immunoenzymatic ELISA method with two analytical packages; namely Tecna (Italy) and Prognosis Biotech (Greece), for comparison purposes, strictly following the manufacturer's instructions. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of AFM1 through dairy consumption and the relevant hazard index (HI) were calculated. The levels of AFM1, in all samples tested, were below the tolerable maximum level of 50 ng/L for milk and 25 ng/L for infant formulas (EC Regulation 1881/2006), while concentrations were very low (0.23-9.38 ng/L for infant formula, 0.54-4.09 ng/L for cheese and 0.20-17.84 ng/L for pasteurized milk). The exposure assessment revealed that infants, toddlers and children were the most exposed groups in AFM1 via milk and formula consumption (0.65, 0.35 and 0.35 respectively). The HI was also noticed higher in those ages, with the maximum value to reach 1.90. Though, for feta cheese the exposure was calculated as very low (EDI: 0.01 and HI: 0.05). Comparing the two analytical packages used, no statistically significant difference was found (p-value >0.05).

Asymmetric control charts with these reference values, 40 and 50 ng kg(-1) warning and action limits are recommended to assess immediately the distribution of AFM1 concentration in incoming consignments. The moving window method, presented as a worked example including 5 days with five samples/day, enabled verification of compliance of production with the legal limit in 98% of the consignments at a 94% probability level. The sampling plan developed assumes consecutive analyses of samples taken from individual farms, which makes early detection of contamination possible and also immediate corrective actions if the AFM1 concentration in a consignment exceeds the reference value. In the latter case different control plans with increased sampling frequency should be applied depending on the level and frequency of contamination. As aflatoxin B₁ increases in feed at about the same time, therefore a coordinated sampling programme performed by the milk processing plants operating in a confined geographic area is more effective and economical then the individual ones. The applicability of the sample size calculation based on binomial theorem and the fast response rate resulting from the recommended sampling plan were verified by taking 1000-10,000 random samples with replacement from the experimental databases representing the normal, moderately and highly contaminated periods. The efficiency of the control plan could be substantially enhanced if the dairy farms used feed with a tolerable level of AFB1."

A binary logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine the association between risk factors for Brucella and contamination of milk samples. Furthermore, a relative effect decomposition study was conducted to determine effective strategies for reducing the risk of Brucella contamination of raw whole milk. Our data indicate that disease prevention and control measures, abortion rate, and animal polyculture are the most important risk factors. Meanwhile, culling after quarantine was identified as an effective protective measure in the current Chinese dairy situation. These results indicate that, although there is a low risk of contamination of milk with Brucella nationwide in China, there are individual regions where contamination is a significant problem. Controlling three factors-culling after quarantine, maintaining a low abortion rate, and avoiding mixing groups of cattle and small ruminants-could effectively reduce the risk of Brucella contamination of raw whole milk."

This study aimed to detect the presence of antibiotics and the level of tylosin in fresh and fermented (nono) milk from cows in Delta state, Nigeria. Two hundred and five samples comprising 126 fresh milk and 79 fermented milk (nono) were sampled from Kwale, Ozoro, and Oleh representing one senatorial district of Delta state, South-South Nigeria. They were screened for the presence of tylosin and other antimicrobial residues using four-plate test and tylosin was confirmed with high-performance liquid chromatography. Antibiotic residues were obtained in 76% and 85% of fresh milk and nono, respectively. Tylosin residue was also detected in 24% fresh milk and 11% nono samples at mean concentrations of 14.64±0.69 µg/l and 7.97±0.23 µg/l, respectively. The mean concentrations of tylosin from both milk types were below the recommended maximum residue limit (MRL) of 50 µg/l in dairy. High prevalence of antimicrobial residues in fresh milk and nono shows that consumers in the study area are predisposed to health hazards due to the presence of residues of different antibiotics in fresh milk and nono. Although tylosin was confirmed in both milk products, the mean concentrations were below the MRL. However, it is still very vital to resort to the observance of withdrawal periods and avoid gross misuse of antimicrobials.

Furthermore, the new model was evaluated with 94 growth rates and 432 time to toxin formation data extracted from the scientific literature for seafood, poultry, meat, pasta and prepared meals. These data included responses for 36 different toxigenic strains of non-proteolytic C. botulinum. The obtained Bf-/Af-values were 0.97/2.04 for μmax-values and 0.96/1.80 for time to toxin formation. The model correctly predicted 93.8% of the growth responses with 5.6% being fail-safe and <1% fail-dangerous. A cocktail of four non-toxin producing Clostridium spp. isolates was used to develop the new model and these isolates had more than 99.8% 16S rRNA gene similarity to non-proteolytic C. botulinum (Group II). The high number of environmental factors included in the new model makes it a flexible tool to facilitate development or reformulation of seafood and poultry products that do not support the growth of non-proteolytic C. botulinum. Further, evaluation of the new model with well characterized products is desirable particularly for meat, vegetables, pasta and prepared meals as well as for dairy products that was not included in the present study."

Because of this, reduction of the vulnerability of foods to adulteration is of high priority to Brazil. This study analyzes economically motivated food fraud and adulterations in Brazil between 2007 and 2017, based on academic journal reports. In addition, alternatives are proposed to minimize these incidents through good practices, traceability systems and the development of methods to detect food fraud and adulteration. Complex supply chains for foods of animal origin, such as milk and dairy products, were the main targets of food fraud and adulterations. Other products prone to fraudulent activities were vegetable oils, especially olive oil, which are high value products. Meat and fish, as well as their respective by-products, were also involved in some food fraud and adulteration, especially substitution. Cases of extraneous ingredient addition were also reported in the coffee and tea sectors. Comprehensive food fraud and adulteration prevention requires the enforcement of regulatory systems, increased sampling and monitoring, training of food producers and handlers, and development of precise, rapid, and cost-effective methods of fraud detection. The availability of robust methods to identify the chemical constituents of foods could be a decisive step, both to detect and prevent fraud in producer countries and to open up new markets to these products. The results of this study can be used to analyze food safety risks and prioritize target areas for food research and policy-making in order to enforce food safety regulations in Brazil.

A population-based cross-sectional survey, including 385 participants was conducted in Korhogo, northern Côte d'Ivoire, to identify risk factors for Sii fecal carriage, including consumption of local FDPs. A structured questionnaire was used to gather participant's socio-demographic and economic characteristics, their relation to livestock and dietary habits. In addition, fresh stool and milk samples were collected. The identification of Sii was done using a SBSEC-specific PCR assay targeting 16S rRNA and groEL genes. The overall prevalence of SBSEC and Sii carriage was 23.2% (confidence interval CI 95% = 18.9-27.5) and 12.0% (CI 95% = 8.4-15.5) for stool, respectively. Prevalence of Sii was significantly higher in consumers of artisanal butter compared with non-consumers (57.1% vs 10.1%, odds ratio OR: 11.9, 95% CI: 3.9-36.6), as well as in persons handling livestock (OR = 3.9; 95% CI = 1.6-9.3) and livestock primary products (OR = 5.7; 95% CI = 2.3-14.3).

Less, however, is known about the effect on the other victim: China's small dairy farmers. Although small backyard producers were not the ones that added melamine to the milk supply, the incomes of dairy farmers fell sharply after the crisis. In response, one of the actions taken by the government was to encourage small dairy producers to check into production complexes that were supposed to supply services, new technologies, and provide for easy/bulk procurement of the milk produced by the cows of the farmers. Because both farmers and their cows were living (and working) away from home, in the rest of the paper we call these complexes cow hotels. In this paper we examine the dynamics of China's dairy production structure before and after the milk scandal. In particular, we seek to gain a better understanding about how China's policies have been successful in encouraging farmers to move from the backyard into cow hotels. We also seek to find if larger or smaller farmers respond differently to these policy measures. Using data from a sample of farmers from dairy-producing villages in Greater Beijing, our empirical analysis finds that 1 yr after the milk scandal, the dairy production structure changed substantially. Approximately one quarter (26%) of the sample checked into cow hotels after the milk scandal, increasing from 2% before the crisis. Our results also demonstrate that the increase in cow hotel production can largely be attributed to China's dairy policies. Finally, our results suggest that the effects of government policy differ across farm sizes; China's dairy policies are more likely to persuade larger farms to join cow hotels. Apparently, larger farms benefit more when they join cow hotels. Overall, these results suggest that during the first year after the crisis, the government policies were effective in moving some of the backyard farmers into cow hotels (although 60% farmers remained backyard producing)."

For a reliable risk assessment, knowledge about the microbial community composition of biofilms in the milking systems of dairy farms must be improved. In this work, swab samples of milking machine biofilms of two dairy farms were investigated by a combination of culture-dependent and -independent methods. Spots in the milking system with enhanced microbial colonization were identified by quantification on selective and non-selective media. In addition, stainless steel coupons were placed into the piping system of a milking machine, removed after several milking intervals, and investigated for colonization by cultivation and culture-independently. Isolates were differentiated and identified by a combination of chemotaxonomical methods and 16S rRNA sequencing. The culture-independent approach involved treatment of the samples with the viability dye propidium monoazide prior to direct DNA-extraction by enzymatic cell lysis and cloning to exclude bias from dead biomass. The milking equipment retainers and the outlet of the milk bulk tank were identified as highly colonized spots on both farms. A high bacterial diversity was detected covering the phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Presence of biofilms was demonstrated on several materials including stainless steel and plastic, which are frequently used in milking machines, but also in dairy processing plants. Growth of mainly Gram-positive bacteria with high percentages of the phylum Actinobacteria was detected on the stainless steel coupons after exposition in the milking system for two to three days.

Samples were collected from 86 cows, from 9 farmers, selling through two dairy cooperatives, with additional samples from informal markets. Production was very low; around one litre/day/cow and 10 L/day/herd. The milk was typically transported by bicycle in high ambient temperatures without refrigeration until reaching the point-of-sale (journey times of 30-120 min), where it was sold without pasteurisation despite milk-borne zoonoses being endemic (bovine tuberculosis (bTB) and Brucellosis). Although microbiological contamination was initially low, with geometric mean total bacterial count (TBC) of 425 cfu/mL (cfu = colony forming units) upon arrival at point-of-sale, poor hygiene led to high bacterial loads later on (geometric mean TBC > 600,000 cfu/mL after two days refrigeration), with almost all samples culture positive for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. After milking, milk was kept for 100-223 min at temperatures favouring microbial growth (median 34 °C) and sold without a microbial kill step. In this situation limited variation in observed standards of milk hygiene had no significant effect on milk end-product bacterial counts. Options for refrigerated transport are limited. Pasteurisation at the cooperative should be investigated, as this would largely remove pathogenic microbes present in the milk whether resulting from cattle infection or poor hygiene during milking and transportation. As milk is also purchased directly from producers, on-farm milk heating options should also be assessed. Smallholders may benefit from access to national markets by providing milk to large dairies, which have systems for ensuring safety. However, this requires significant investment and an increased and more consistent supply of milk; and many consumers, unable to afford milk sold through formal sectors, would not benefit."

Given the emergence of antibiotic resistance (ABR) and possible zoonotic spillovers, S aureus from mastitic cattle pose threat to both veterinary and public health. Therefore, assessment of their ABR status and pathogenic translation in human infection models is crucial. In this study, 43 S. aureus isolates associated with bovine mastitis obtained from four different Canadian provinces (Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, and Atlantic provinces) were tested for ABR and virulence through phenotypic and genotypic profiling. All 43 isolates exhibited crucial virulence characteristics such as hemolysis, and biofilm formation, and six isolates from ST151, ST352, and ST8 categories showed ABR. Genes associated with ABR (tetK, tetM, aac6', norA, norB, lmrS, blaR, blaZ, etc. ), toxin production (hla, hlab, lukD, etc. ), adherence (fmbA, fnbB, clfA, clfB, icaABCD, etc. ), and host immune invasion (spa, sbi, cap, adsA, etc. ) were identified by analyzing whole-genome sequences. Although none of the isolates possessed human adaptation genes, both groups of ABR and antibiotic-susceptible isolates demonstrated intracellular invasion, colonization, infection, and death of human intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2), and Caenorhabditis elegans. Notably, the susceptibilities of S. aureus towards antibiotics such as streptomycin, kanamycin, and ampicillin were altered when the bacteria were internalized in Caco-2 cells and C. elegans.

Cross-contamination of raw milk through faeces is an important vehicle for transmission of Campylobacter to consumers. This systematic review and meta-analysis, aimed to summarize data on the prevalence and concentration of Campylobacter in faeces of dairy cows. Suitable scientific articles published up to July 2021 were identified through a systematic literature search and subjected to screening and quality assessment. Fifty-three out of 1338 identified studies were eligible for data extraction and 44 were further eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence was calculated in two different meta-analytic models: a simple model based on one average prevalence estimate per study and a multilevel meta-analytic model that included all prevalence outcomes reported in each study (including different subgroups of e. g. health status and age of dairy cows). The results of the two models were significantly different with a pooled prevalence estimate of 29%, 95% CI [23-36%] and 51%, 95% CI [44-57%], respectively. The effect of sub-groups on prevalence were analyzed with a multilevel mixed-effect model which showed a significant effect of the faecal collection methods and Campylobacter species on the prevalence. A meta-analysis on concentration data could not be performed due to the limited availability of data. This systematic review highlights important data gaps and limitations in current studies and variation of prevalence outcomes between available studies. The included studies used a variety of methods for sampling, data collection and analysis of Campylobacter that added uncertainty to the pooled prevalence estimates. Nevertheless, the performed meta-analysis improved our understanding of Campylobacter prevalence in faeces of dairy cows and is considered a valuable basis for the further development of quantitative microbiological risk assessment models for Campylobacter in (raw) milk and food products thereof."

The objectives of the present study were to identify the source of, strains associated with, and risk factors for Listeria monocytogenes infection for patients affected by the outbreak. Microbiological, case-control, and environmental investigations were conducted. Participants in the case-control study were case patients who became infected with L. monocytogenes between 1 October 2000 and 31 January 2001 and control subjects who were matched with case patients on the basis of ethnicity, sex, age, and pregnancy status. All participants were residents of Winston-Salem. We identified 13 patients, all of whom were Hispanic, including 12 females who were 18-38 years of age. Eleven case patients were pregnant; infection with L. monocytogenes resulted in 5 stillbirths, 3 premature deliveries, and 3 infected newborns. Case patients were more likely than control subjects to have eaten the following foods: fresh, unlabeled, Mexican-style cheese sold by door-to-door vendors (matched odds ratio [MOR], 17.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-152.5); queso fresco, a Mexican-style soft cheese (MOR, 7.3; 95% CI, 1.4-37.5); and hot dogs (MOR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.1-19.4). L. monocytogenes isolates recovered from 10 female case patients, from cheese bought from a door-to-door vendor, from unlabeled cheese from 2 Hispanic markets, and from raw milk from a local dairy had indistinguishable patterns on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. This outbreak of listeriosis was caused by noncommercial, fresh, Mexican-style cheese made from contaminated raw milk traced to 1 local dairy. We recommend educating Hispanic women about food safety while they are pregnant, enforcing laws that regulate the sale of raw milk and dairy products made by unlicensed manufacturers, making listeriosis a reportable disease in all states, routinely interviewing case patients, and routinely subtyping clinical L. monocytogenes isolates."

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, the quantitative load and the genetic strain diversity of Campylobacter spp. in dairy cattle of different age groups. Faecal samples of 200 dairy cattle from three farms in the central part of Lithuania were collected and examined for Campylobacter. Cattle herds of all three farms were Campylobacter spp. positive, with a prevalence ranging from 75% (farm I), 77.5% (farm II) to 83.3% (farm III). Overall, the highest prevalence was detected in calves (86.5%) and heifers (86.2%). In contrast, the lowest Campylobacter prevalence was detectable in dairy cows (60.6%). C. jejuni, C. coli, C. lari and C. fetus subsp. fetus were identified in faecal samples of dairy cattle. C. upsaliensis was not detectable in any sample. The high counts of Campylobacter spp. were observed in faecal material of dairy cattle (average 4.5 log10 cfu/g). The highest numbers of Campylobacter spp. were found in faecal samples from calves (average 5.3 log10 cfu/g), whereas, faecal samples from cows harboured the lowest number of Campylobacter spp. (average 3.7 log10 cfu/g). Genotyping by flaA PCR-RFLP analysis of selected C. jejuni isolates showed that some genotypes were present in all farms and all age groups. However, farm or age specific genotypes were also identified. Future studies are needed to investigate risk factors related to the degree of colonisation in cattle. Based on that, possible measures to reduce the colonisation and subsequent shedding of Campylobacter in cattle could be established. It is important to further investigate the epidemiology of Campylobacter in the cattle population in order to assess associated risks to public health."

In Canada, most human cryptosporidiosis cases are due to Cryptosporidium hominis; however, the presence of zoonotic Cryptosporidium parvum has been observed. Since 2005, the incidence of cryptosporidiosis in Ontario has been consistently higher than the national average; however, it is not understood why, suggesting an incomplete understanding of the pathogen's ecology, epidemiology and transmission pathways. The goal of this study was to explore the spatial distribution of human cryptosporidiosis across the 29 Public Health Unit (PHU) areas of Southern Ontario from 2011 to 2014. Surveillance data on human cryptosporidiosis were obtained from Public Health Ontario. Choropleth and isopleth maps were used to display the distribution of incidence rates of human cryptosporidiosis. High-rate clusters of human cryptosporidiosis were identified. Poisson and spatial Poisson regression models were used to determine the relationship between the incidence of human cryptosporidiosis, cattle density and the smoothed farm-level prevalence of bovine cryptosporidiosis at the PHU level. The annual incidence of reported human cryptosporidiosis in Southern Ontario ranged from 1.62 (95% CI: 1.41-1.86) to 1.82 (95%CI: 1.60-2.06) cases per 100,000 population, with an overall cumulative incidence of 6.91 (95%CI: 6.47-7.39) cases per 100,000 for the 4-year study period. High-risk clusters of human cryptosporidiosis were identified in each year. The relative risk for the clusters ranged from 2.03 (95% CI: 1.63-2.55) to 6.87 (95% CI: 5.07-9.30). A relationship was found between the incidence of cryptosporidiosis and dairy cattle density.

This review aims to understand food safety-related perspectives and practices among consumers and food vendors in Ethiopia to identify motivations, beliefs, and values that shape and/or drive their practices. A well-defined search and review identified 116 relevant articles. These spanned eight of the ten regional states and two chartered cities, with most work focusing on urban areas and on a sample within one state or chartered city. Ninety-four studies focused on vendors or food handlers; fifteen articles examined both consumers and vendors, but only four assessed interactions between the groups. Meat, dairy products, and ready-to-eat (street) foods were the most studied food groups. Food service establishments were the most examined outlets. Forty-six studies examined generic food safety issues or concerns. Overall, 102 studies assessed food safety practices; 53 studies examined knowledge, and 19 studies assessed attitudes. A gap in vendors' observed practices versus knowledge and attitudes was noted. Consumer deductions of food safety were based on vendor practices. Both groups used physical attributes based on senses to assess quality and safety of animal-source foods, had their own 'coping' strategies to address food safety-related concerns, and had similar views on consumer choice motives. Analysis of food and the food handling environment revealed a high level of contamination. An additional study, included after the original search, identified training to be effective in influencing knowledge, attitudes, and practices - though results for attitudes and practices were not sustained in the long term. Future research should address consumers and consumer-vendor interactions and include the full triad of knowledge-attitudes-practices. It is also recommended to focus on nutrient-rich foods as well as on traditional markets and local eateries. Improving the quality of research will be critical to improve food safety in Ethiopia."

Many control programmes utilise a risk assessment and management plan (RAMP) to identify specific risks for transmission of infection on individual farms and then recommend tailored biosecurity measures to mitigate the risk. It is important that infected farms in particular, practice effective biocontainment in the calving area and pre-weaned calf area. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine what proportion of MAP-infected farms (PCR-positive) enrolled in a control programme had detectable MAP in their calf environment; (2) to compare RAMP scores and apparent within-herd prevalence (aWHP) of PCR-positive and PCR-negative farms; (3) to evaluate the correlation between RAMP scores, aWHP and levels of contamination based on PCR test Ct value. A novel environmental sampling protocol combining manure samples and boot swab samples was conducted in the calving area and pre-weaned calf area on 28 dairy farms with PCR-confirmed MAP infection. All samples were tested with PCR. Logistic regression modelling was used to evaluate the association between RAMP score and aWHP and PCR outcome. Overall, 46% of farms had positive PCR samples in either the calving area, pre-weaned calf area or both. The calving area was positive in 36% of farms and the pre-weaned calf area was positive in 21% of farms. There was a moderate, negative correlation (r = -0.45; p = 0.08) observed between RAMP scores and Ct value at the sample-level that slightly missed the required significance level. No significant association was identified between RAMP scores or aWHP and PCR test outcome (positive or negative). It was concluded that environmental sampling of the calving area and pre-weaned calf area has potential applications in the assessment of transmission risk on infected farms and could be used to monitor the efficacy of biosecurity measures over time.

Between June 1998 and April 1999, an outbreak caused by L. monocytogenes serotype 3a in butter occurred in Finland. The majority of the cases were immunocompromised and hospitalized at the Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH), where 7-g butter packages produced by a dairy plant were used as the only butter brand. The butter had also been sold to 10 other central hospitals as well as to the retail market. Based on the data on hospital stay, butter consumption and the qualitative and quantitative analyses of L. monocytogenes in butter, the attack rates and exposure were estimated. Incubation studies on the naturally contaminated small butter packages showed that the levels found in the packages at the time of detection of the outbreak could reliably be used for these estimations. However, the levels of L. monocytogenes in 500-g packages increased. The attack rate among HUCH patients varied from 70 to 117 cases per 1000 patients at risk, depending on which estimate of the contamination level of butter (100-60%) was used. The highest single dose (7.7 x 10(4) CFU in one meal) could have been sufficient to cause the listeriosis cases at HUCH. However, this data also supports another hypothesis, according to which these listeriosis cases were caused by a prolonged daily consumption of contaminated butter during the hospital stay. The estimated daily dose, based on the hospital kitchen data or the highest detected level in a wholesale sample (11,000 CFU/g), would have varied from 1.4 x 10(1) to 2.2 x 10(3) CFU/day or from 2.2 x 10(4) to 3.1 x 10(5) CFU/day, respectively. The choice of the hypothesis has a crucial impact on the interpretation of this data for the dose-response estimations as well as for the discussion on Food Safety Objectives. Due to the susceptibility of hospital patients, special care must be taken in order to avoid even low levels of L. monocytogenes in food served."

Red breakfast cereals and red candy (that contain FD&C Red No. 3), dairy products, eggs, milk, marine fish, and iodized salt contained the most significant quantities of iodine. Iodide content of individual raw milk samples from approximately 2500 farms in New York State was measured. Approximately 62% of all farms had milk iodide levels less than 200 μg/L, 28% between 200 and 499 μg/L, 7% between 500 and 1000 μg/L and 3% had greater than 1000 μg/L. The iodine content of all types of retail milk averaged 394.1 μg/L, cheese and cheese products averaged 15.2 μg/100 g. Most of the iodine partitions into the whey during cheese processing. For dairy powders (including whey), the average iodine content was 471.8 μg/100 g. Use of these powders as ingredients in other dairy and non-dairy products can contribute to high iodine content of other food products. In particular, the iodine content of ice cream was extremely variable, ranging from 18 to 359 μg/100 g. Generally, ice creams and ice milks that contained high proportions of whey and non-fat milk powders had higher levels of iodine in the finished product. Addition of FD&C Red No. 3 to foods substantially increases their total iodine content. However, the measured free iodide content of four brands of red breakfast cereal was higher than would be expected. Food and Drug Administration specifications for certified lots of FD&C Red No. 3 allows up to 0.4% sodium iodide as a contaminant from manufacture. The four brands of red breakfast cereal averaged 6% of their total iodine as free iodide (366 μg/30 g serving).

Hence, herein, a highly sensitive colorimetric sensor for the visual detection of melamine and Hg2+ ions has been developed using a metal-oxide-in-MOF nanomaterial (CeO2-MIL (Fe)) as a peroxidase mimic. Highly mono-dispersed CeO2-MIL (Fe) was synthesised via a facile hydrothermal process. The CeO2-MIL (Fe) exhibited outstanding peroxidase activity, and can catalyze the oxidation of TMB (3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine) by H2O2, resulting in the development of blue-coloured oxidation products within 5 min. In the presence of melamine, the H2O2 interacts with melamine to form melamine-H2O2via H-bonding. Due to the uptake of H2O2 by melamine, the catalytic oxidation reaction was halted, and the blue TMB oxidation product became pale. The relative change in the absorption intensity at 652 nm was proportional to the concentration of melamine in the linear range of 0-0.1 μM and the detection limit was found to be 8 nM. Subsequently, when Hg2+ ions were added to the above solution, the Hg2+ ions reacted with melamine via strong covalent bonding to form a Hg2+-melamine covalent complex, causing the release of H2O2, which again strongly oxidised the TMB to give the blue-coloured oxidation product. Furthermore, the comparative change in the absorption intensity at 652 nm was dependent on the concentration of Hg2+ ions in the linear range of 0-6 nM, and a detection limit of 2 nM was achieved. The suggested system has several advantages including greater simplicity, good selectivity, naked-eye detection and cost-effectiveness without using any complicated detection procedure. This technique was successfully utilized to identify melamine in real foods and Hg2+ ions in real water samples, yielding high recovery rates."

This paper presents findings from that systems-based analysis, which assessed conditions on the farm potentially contributing to contamination of the lettuce. The farm had three sources of irrigation water: groundwater from onsite wells, surface water delivered by a water management agency and effluent from wastewater lagoons on nearby dairy farms. Wastewater effluent was blended with the other sources and used only to irrigate animal feed crops. However, water management on the farm, including control of wastewater blending, appeared to create potential for cross-contamination. Pressure gradients and lack of backflow measures in the irrigation system might have created conditions for cross-contamination of water used to irrigate lettuce. The irrigation network on the farm had evolved over time to meet various needs, without an overall analysis of how that evolution potentially created vulnerabilities to contamination of irrigation water. The type of systems analysis described here is one method for helping to ensure that such vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.

The modified method included incubation at 42 degrees C instead of 44 degrees C and serial dilution of the enriched media prior to plating on Druggan-Forsythe-Iversen agar. Presumptive Cronobacter spp. colonies were confirmed by Real Time PCR targeting the dnaG on the MMS operon. All Cronobacter spp. isolated were speciated using biochemical tests, tested for resistance to 8 antibiotics and characterised using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Cronobacter spp. was not recovered from cattle faeces, farm soil or trough water but isolates (n=33) were recovered from a variety of other sample types including cattle feed, pork and beef cuts, beef burgers and beef mince, green vegetables as well as organic breakfast cereals and domestic vacuum cleaner dust. The species recovered included C. Sakazakii (n=21), C. malonaticus (n=1) and C. turicensis (n=1). Of the 33 isolates 51% were resistant to Cephalothin but sensitive to all other 7 tested antibiotics. Sub-typing of the recovered isolates by PFGE showed considerable clonal diversity, though a number of persistent PFGE profiles were observed. In conclusion the study showed that Cronobacter spp. was not carried by food production animals but was present in a range of diverse sample types and environs with particular association with dry environments."

However, when lactating animals feed on Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-containing feed, the hydroxyl metabolite aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) contaminates the milk and dairy products. The objective of the current study was to assess the level of AFM1 in raw milk, normally pasteurized milk and Ethiopian cottage cheese collected from value chain actors (producers, collectors, processors and retailers). Cross-sectional study and simple random techniques were used to collect primary samples. A total of 160 composite samples was collected; raw milk (n = 64), pasteurized milk (n = 64) and cheese (n = 32) was analyzed. Quantitative analysis of AFM1 was conducted using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results indicate that AFM1 was detected in all milk products. Results along value chains show that the concentration of AFM1 in raw milk from collectors was significantly higher than from producers, and in pasteurized milk from processors and retailers (p < 0.05). However, no significant (p > 0.05) difference was observed in cottage cheese value-chain actors in all regions. Comparison of AFM1 mean values among all dairy products shows that raw milk had a significantly higher concentration of AFM1 followed by pasteurized milk and cottage cheese. However, there was no significant difference between raw and pasteurized milk (p > 0.05). The mean AFM1 contamination in milk products ranged from 0.137 to 0.319 µg/L (mean value 0.285 µg/L). The contamination percentages of AFM1 in raw milk (62.50%), pasteurized milk (67.20%) and cottage cheese (25%) were above the regulatory limit set by the European Union (EU) (0.05 µg/L). According to USA/Ethiopian Standard (US/ES) (0.50 µg/L), 21.87%, 25% and 1% exceeded the regulatory limit for the above products, respectively. The overall prevalence (56.88%) was above the EU regulatory limit and 19.38% over US/ES regulations. Therefore, to provide accurate information about the health risk to consumers, there is a need to conduct risk assessment studies in consumers of milk and dairy products at different age groups."

Also, the antibiotic susceptibility of Salmonella spp. isolates was demonstrated by 10 different antibiotic disks. For this purpose, 55 ice cream samples were collected from markets and pastries and analyzed in terms of the specified parameters. The results showed that 3/55 ice cream samples were positive in terms of S. aureus, while 2/55 sample were found positive by the IMS method with respect to Salmonella. The Salmonella isolates were confirmed as 100% Salmonella spp. by the conventional methods and API 20E test kit. The carried out antibiotic susceptibility test results indicated that these two isolates showed susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, trimethoprim and tetracycline at 100% level, while their resistance to streptomycin, ampicillin and kanamycin were at 100% level. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Ice cream is a popular frozen dairy product made with milk, cream, water and other ingredients. The quality of ice cream is affected by some factors, including wide variety of ingredients, production practices, transportation, storage conditions and temperature fluctuations. Although the potentially hazardous pathogenic microorganisms are rarely encountered in ice cream due to unsuitable conditions, they can be contaminated by the various types of microorganisms. The use of sensitive and specific methods for the isolation and identification of pathogen microorganisms is very important. Immunomagnetic separation system has been used for the selective capture and concentration of Salmonella from various foods. On the contrary, the antibiotic susceptibility of pathogens has a critical importance for human health. For this reason, it is thought that determination of antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of isolated and identified Salmonella spp. is very important in terms of food safety and human health."

The over-production and over-consumption of meat and dairy products is resource-intensive, energy-dense and creates public health and food equity risks, including the creation of superbugs and antimicrobial resistance, contamination and pollution of land and waterways, and injustice to animals and humans who work in the sector. Yet the continuing and expanding use of animals is entrenched in food systems. One policy response frequently suggested by parties from all sectors (industry, government and civil society) is voluntary or mandatory labelling reforms to educate consumers about the healthiness and sustainability of food products, and thus reduce demand. This paper evaluates the pitfalls and potentials of labelling as an incremental regulatory governance stepping-stone to transformative food system change. We use empirical data from a study of the regulatory politics of animal welfare and environmental claims on Australian products together with an ecological regulation conceptual approach to critically evaluate the potential of labelling as a regulatory mechanism. We show that labelling is generally ineffective as a pathway to transformative food system change for three reasons: it does not do enough to redistribute power away from dominant actors to those harmed by the food system; it is vulnerable to greenwashing and reductionism; and it leads to market segmentation rather than collective political action. We suggest the need for regulatory governance that is ecological by design. Labelling can only be effective when connected to a broader suite of measures to reduce overall production and consumption of meat. We conclude with some recommendations as to how public health advocates and policy entrepreneurs might strategically use and contest labelling and certification schemes to build support for transformative food system change and to avoid the regressive consequences of labelling."

On each selected farm, faecal samples were collected from milking cows, calves and humans; rectal swabs were obtained from pet farm dogs; bulk milk was sampled as well as effluent from the milking parlour. Escherichia coli was isolated from all sources on selective media using standard methods. Isolates of E. coli were subjected to slide agglutination test using E. coli O157 antiserum, vero cell cytotoxicity assay to detect verocytotoxin (VT) and heat labile toxin (LT) production, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect VT genes, and the dry spot test to screen for E. coli O157 and non-O157 strains. In addition, faecal samples from animal and human sources were tested for VT genes using PCR. Of a total of 933 E. coli isolates tested by the slide test, eight (0.9%) were positive for the O157 strain. The vero cell cytotoxicity assay detected VT-producing strains of E. coli in 16.6%, 14.6%, 3.2% and 7.1% of isolates from cows, calves, farm dogs and humans respectively (P < 0.05; chi(2)). For LT production, the highest frequency was detected amongst isolates of E. coli from calves (10.8%) and the lowest (0.0%) amongst isolates from humans and bulk milk (P < 0.05; chi(2)). Of the 61 VT-producing isolates by vero cell cytotoxicity assay tested by PCR, the VT, LT and eae genes were detected in 62.3%, 4.9% and 1.6% respectively (P < 0.05; chi(2)). Amongst the 45 E. coli isolates that were VT positive (vero cell) or VT-gene positive by PCR, 2.2%, 2.2%, 4.4% and 6.7% belonged to non-O157 strains O91, O111, O103 and O157, respectively, as determined by the Dry spot test. Detection of VTEC strains in milk and dairy animals poses a health risk to consumers of milk originating from these farms. In addition, the demonstration of VTEC strains in humans, VT gene in faecal samples and E. coli isolates as well as non-O157 VTEC strains of E. coli are being documented for the first time in the country."

Growth and cereulide kinetic parameters were estimated and the three parameters (i) time to first cereulide quantification (tcer), (ii) maximum specific growth rates (μmax) and (iii) cereulide production rates (k) were modelled as a function of temperature. As temperature increased, growth lag time and tcer were shorter while microbial increase and cereulide production happened earlier, and at higher rates. Maximum concentration of cells and maximum cereulide concentration proved to be temperature-independent, reaching the average values of 7.9 ± 0.3 log10(CFU/mL) and 2.6 ± 0.2 log10(ng. g-1) respectively. Moreover, the time to reach the widely used threshold of 5 log10CFU/mL (t5log) was tested against tcer, and this suggested that this threshold can be used with increased confidence at lower temperatures to assure toxin is not quantified in this matrix. The average tcer were equal to 314 h, 118 h, 73 h and 45 h for 12 °C, 15 °C, 18 °C and 20 °C respectively. A validation study was performed using independent data sets obtained with the same strain in other dairy matrices. The microbial growth models presented good predictive power even when extrapolated beyond the temperature range of construction. Nevertheless, the models proposed for prediction of toxin production over time presented limitations, especially for food matrices that deviate significantly from the original matrix for which the model was developed, making cereulide predictions less accurate. Our findings suggest that similar modelling approaches can be used to predict growth, time to first cereulide quantification as well as cereulide formation over time for a specific matrix, but that matrix-extrapolations are more suitable for growth than for cereulide."

Eight‐hundred dairy samples were collected and cultured. Antimicrobial resistance and genotyping patterns were assessed using disk diffusion and polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Thirty‐one out of 800 (3.87%) traditional dairy product samples were positive for H. pylori. Cheese (11.53%) samples had the highest incidence of H. pylori, while yoghurt (1.11%) had the lowest. Helicobacter pylori strains harbored the highest incidence of resistance against ampicillin (93.54%), amoxicillin (93.54%), tetracycline (90.32%), erythromycin (80.64%), and metronidazole (77.41%).

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Due to the high consumption rate of dairy samples, they should have a high microbial quality. Foods with animal origins and especially dairy samples are considered as a probable source of Helicobacter pylori infections. The incidence of contamination of dairy samples by H. pylori is fairly high, and nearly all of the isolates exhibited resistance against several types of antimicrobials and harbored pathogenic vacA, cagA, and iceA genotypes, so the risk of probable foodborne diseases caused by H. pylori in such products should not be neglected.

These goals are hard to achieve. The complexity of national and global trade structures obscures a clear view of trade flows and, consequently, it is often impossible to unravel complex trade links quickly. Furthermore, increasing public concerns about possible health hazards caused by global trade put additional pressure on decision makers. The aim of this paper was to unveil the specific trade structures of the German milk supply chain, to highlight how these structures could affect the spatial spread of a hypothetical contaminant, and to quantify the risk of the contaminant reaching the consumer. To achieve this goal, the vertical and horizontal trade links between milk producers, dairies, and consumers were taken into account. The horizontal flow of milk between dairies (inter-dairy trade), which is intended to compensate a temporary over- or undersupply of milk, is of special importance in this respect. We hypothesized that the extent of inter-dairy trade would significantly influence the spatial spread of contaminated milk and the contamination risk. This hypothesis was tested using a computer simulation model that predicts the hypothetical spread of a contaminant via trade of milk. The model parameters were estimated using trade data collected in 2004 and 2010. The results of our study indicate that inter-dairy trade significantly influenced the contamination risk. Compared with a scenario with no inter-dairy trade, the risk that contaminated milk will reach the consumer was up to 4 times higher, even with moderate inter-dairy trade. The contamination risk depended on the extent of inter-dairy trade in a nonlinear way and reached its maximum asymptotically when inter-dairy trade increased. The contamination risk exhibited considerable spatial variation, which could be utilized to implement more accurate food control interventions in times of crisis caused by a foodborne disease."

For risk characterization, the calculation of hazard index (HI), Margin of Exposure, and the hepatocellular carcinoma incidence were used. The results indicate that the group of toddlers that consume a large amount of milk and milk products are exposed to a certain level of health risk. The mean estimated daily intake of toddlers is in the range of 0.008-0.221 ng kg-1 bw day-1; the 97.5th percentile exposure of toddlers is between 0.013 ng kg-1 bw day-1 and 0.379 ng kg-1 bw day-1, resulting in a HI above 1. According to our study, the exposure of older age groups does not pose an emergent health risk. Nevertheless, the presence of carcinogenic compounds should be kept to a minimum in the whole population."

One of the main concerns regarding the spreading of biosolids on agricultural land is the potential uptake of contaminants into plants which may bio-transfer into grazing animals that supply the food chain directly (e. g. meat and milk) and hence are subsequently consumed. The aim of this project was to create a quantitative risk assessment model to estimate the fate and translocation of triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) into the feed (grass) and food chain with subsequent human exposure. The model's results indicate that TCS and TCC have low potential to transfer into milk and beef following the ingestion of contaminated grass by dairy cows. Mean estimated TCS and TCC residues in milk and beef show that TCC had the greatest concentration (mean values of 7.77×10-6mgkg-1 in milk and 1.36×10-4mgkg-1 in beef). Human exposure results show that TCC was greater for milk consumption in infants (1-4years) (mean value 1.14×10-7mgkg-1bwd-1) and for beef consumption by teens (12-17years) (mean value 6.87×10-8mgkg-1bwd-1). Concentrations of TCS and TCC were well below the estimated acceptable daily intake (ADI). Human health risk was estimated by evaluation of the hazard quotient (HQ), which used the NOAEL as a toxicity endpoint, combined with milk and beef human exposure estimates. HQ results show that all values were <0.01 (no existing risk). A sensitivity analysis revealed that the Kow and initial concentration in biosolids as the parameters of greatest importance (correlation coefficients 0.91 and 0.19, respectively). This highlights the importance of physio-chemical properties of the compounds and their detection in biosolids post wastewater treatment along with their persistence in soil following application. This model is a valuable tool in which to ascertain the potential transfer of contaminants in the environment into animal forage with knock on consequences for exposure through the human food chain."

Although originally considered a problem to human health, the emerging crisis of AMR requires a ""One Health"" approach, considering human, animal, and environmental reservoirs. In this regard, the extensive use of antibiotics in the livestock production systems to treat mastitis and other bacterial diseases can lead to the presence of AMR genes in bacteria that contaminate or naturally occur in milk and dairy products, thereby introducing them into the food chain. The recent development of high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is improving the fast characterization of microbial communities and their functional capabilities. In this context, whole metagenome sequencing (WMS), also called shotgun metagenomic sequencing, allows the generation of a vast amount of data which can be interrogated to generate the desired evidence, including the resistome. However, the amount of host DNA poses a major challenge to metagenome analysis. Given the current absence of literature concerning the application of WMS on milk to detect the presence of AMR genes, in the present study, we evaluated the effect of different sequencing depths, host DNA depletion methods and matrices to characterize the resistome of a milk production environment. WMS was conducted on three aliquots of bulk tank milk and three aliquots of the in-line milk filter collected from a single dairy farm; a fourth aliquot of milk and milk filter was bioinformatically subsampled. Two commercially available host DNA depletion methods were applied, and metagenomic DNA was sequenced to two different sequencing depth. Milk filters proved to be the most suitable matrices to evaluate the presence of AMR genes; besides, the pre-extraction host DNA depletion method was the most efficient approach to remove host reads. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the limitations posed by the host DNA in investigating the milk resistome with a WMS approach, confirming the circulation of AMR genes in the milk production environment."

Samples (n = 350) were collected from four animal (two cattle and two buffalo) farms, i. e. , their environment. Thirty Karish cheese samples were collected from 10 markets in Mansoura, Egypt. S. aureus was detected in 17.9%, 17.6%, and 16.7% of samples collected from cattle, buffalo and Karish cheese, respectively. About 19% of isolated S. aureus strains carried the mecA gene. The distribution of the mecA gene was high in isolates from Karish cheese (60%), followed by samples collected from buffalo (16.2%) and cattle (16%). More than 34% of isolated S. aureus strains were enterotoxigenic, and the presence of enterotoxin genes was higher in isolates from Karish cheese (80%) than those from cattle (48%) and buffalo (18.9%). The most predominant enterotoxin gene among isolated S. aureus strains was the sea gene (26.9%), followed by sec (4.5%) and sed (3%) genes. Isolated strains were resistant to clindamycin (100%), kanamycin (97%), nalidixic acid (86.6%), cefotaxime (73.1%) sulphamethazole-trimethoprim (65.6%).

The study was aimed to isolate and characterize extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli from milk samples collected from different parts of West Bengal, India, to assess the potential risk associated with the food. Around 182 milk samples were collected from apparently healthy cows reared by organized dairy farms in West Bengal. E. coli was isolated from collected samples as per standard methods followed by serotyping. The detection of ESBL-producing E. coli was done both phenotypically and genotypically by detecting the presence of bla CTX-M gene. Antibiogram of the ESBL-positive isolates was done using common 12 antibiotics by disc diffusion method. A total of 22 (12.1%) samples were found to be positive for E. coli in this study. Different serotypes such as O11, O20, O22, O34, O35, O128, O149, and UT were isolated from the collected samples. 12 (54.5%) E. coli strains showed the capability of producing ESBL, both phenotypically and genotypically with the presence of bla CTX-M gene. Antibiogram of these ESBL-positive isolates revealed the drugs such as colistin (100%), levofloxacin (83.33%), and imipenem (66.67%) to be highly sensitive against this pathogen but drugs such as cefotaxime (100%), ceftazidime (91.67%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (83.33%), tetracycline (75.00%), and gentamicin (58.33%) to be very much resistant.

The number and size of foodborne disease outbreaks, as well as the etiologic agents, food vehicles of transmission, site of food preparation and contributing factors associated with outbreaks were also examined. From 1973 through 1997, states and local health departments reported 604 outbreaks of foodborne disease in schools. The median number of school outbreaks annually was 25 (range, 9 to 44). In 60% of the outbreaks an etiology was not determined, and in 45% a specific food vehicle of transmission was not determined. Salmonella was the most commonly identified pathogen, accounting for 36% of outbreak reports with a known etiology. Specific food vehicles of transmission were epidemiologically identified in 333 (55%) of the 604 outbreaks. The most commonly implicated vehicles were foods containing poultry (18.6%), salads (6.0%), Mexican-style food (6.0%), beef (5.7%) and dairy products excluding ice cream (5.0%). The most commonly reported food preparation practices that contributed to these school-related outbreaks were improper food storage and holding temperatures and food contaminated by a food handler. Strengthening food safety measures in schools would better protect students and school staff from outbreaks of foodborne illness. Infection control policies, such as training and certification of food handlers in the proper storage and cooking of foods, meticulous hand washing and paid sick leave for food handlers with gastroenteritis, could make meals safer for American students."

TBC tended to increase as CC increased in bulk milk (r = 0.5). In the final regression model, increased TBC, CC and the contamination of farm bulk milk by S. aureus were significantly associated with dirty barns, dirty cows and soiled udder and teats. TBC was higher during the rainy season than during the dry season. The reported practice of washing teats with warm water significantly decreased CC and CPS.

For shotgun metagenomics, total nucleic acids (NAs) are isolated from complex samples such as foodstuff. Along with microbial NAs, high amounts of matrix NAs are extracted that might outcompete microbial NAs during next-generation sequencing and compromise sensitivity for the detection of low abundance micro-organisms. Sensitive laboratory methods are indispensable for detecting highly pathogenic foodborne bacteria like Brucella spp. , because a low infectious dose is sufficient to cause human disease through the consumption of contaminated dairy or meat products. In our study, we applied shotgun metagenomic sequencing for the identification and characterization of Brucella spp. in artificially and naturally contaminated raw milk from various ruminant species. With the depletion of eukaryotic cells prior to DNA extraction, Brucella was detectable at 10 bacterial cells ml-1, while at the same time microbiological culture and isolation of the fastidious bacteria commonly failed. Moreover, we were able to retrieve the genotype of a Brucella isolate from a metagenomic dataset, indicating the potential of metagenomics for outbreak investigations using SNPs and core-genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). To improve diagnostic applications, we developed a new bioinformatics approach for strain prediction based on SNPs to identify the correct species and define a certain strain with only low numbers of genus-specific reads per sample. This pipeline turned out to be more sensitive and specific than Mash Screen. In raw milk samples, we simultaneously detected numerous other zoonotic pathogens, antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors.

The biofilm forming behavior of 143 L. monocytogenes strains was determined in four different media that were rich, moderate or poor in nutrients at 12°C, 20°C, 30°C and 37°C. The biofilm formation was mostly influenced by temperature, resulting in decreased biofilm formation with decreasing temperature. Biofilm formation was enhanced in nutrient-poor medium rather than in nutrient-rich medium, and especially in nutrient-poor medium significantly enhanced biofilm production was observed early in biofilm maturation underlining the effect of medium on biofilm formation rate. Also serotype had a significant effect on biofilm formation and was influenced by medium used because strains from both serotype 1/2b and 1/2a formed more biofilm than serotype 4b strains in nutrient-rich medium at 20°C, 30°C and 37°C, whereas in nutrient-poor medium the biofilm production levels of serotype 1/2a and 4b strains were rather similar and lower than serotype 1/2b strains. The strains used originated from various origins, including dairy, meat, industrial environment, human and animal, and the level of biofilm formation was not significantly affected by the origin of isolation, irrespective of medium used and temperature tested. A linear model was used to correlate crystal violet staining of biofilm production to the number of viable cells within the biofilm. This showed that crystal violet staining was poorly correlated to the number of viable cells in nutrient-poor medium, and LIVE/DEAD staining and DNase I treatment revealed that this could be attributed to the presence of non-viable cells and extracellular DNA in the biofilm matrix. The significant impact of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on biofilm production of L. monocytogenes underlined that niche-specific features determine the levels of biofilm produced, and insights in biofilm formation characteristics will allow us to further optimize strategies to control the biofilm formation of L. monocytogenes."

Results show that the most recent mean dietary exposures for all groups are below 2 pg TEQ/kg BW/day, the tolerable daily intake established for dioxins by the World Health Organization. Between 1999 and 2002 mean dioxin intakes from food appear to have decreased, but when estimates are adjusted based on a standardized limit of detection and evaluating only those {congenerxfood} combinations common to all 4 years, no trend is apparent. When dioxin concentrations below the limit of detection are represented by one-half the limit, approximately 5% of the intake estimates for 2-year-olds and 1% of the intake estimates for 6-year-olds exceed the tolerable daily intake by about 10%, although such upper-percentile estimates should not be equated with excess risk. When non-detectable dioxin values are set to zero (i. e. , when only dioxin values actually measured are used), only 1% of intake estimates exceed the tolerable daily intake for 2-year-olds. As expected, about 50% of daily dietary dioxin intake by the total US population is attributable to meat and dairy products, based on the same food group classifications used by the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on the Implications of Dioxin in the Food Supply.

The disease is often nicknamed the 'burger bug' but it appears that environmental risk factors may be more important. In this study we use four techniques (outbreak analysis, case-control studies, disease mapping and quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA)) to determine whether burgers or environmental pathways present the greater risk in Scotland. Analysis of E. coli O157 outbreaks in Scotland from 1994 to 2003 associated with either meat or dairy foods, or with environmental transmission shows that approximately 40% [M1] of these outbreaks were foodborne, 54% were environmental and 6% involved both transmission routes. However, the largest outbreaks tend to be foodborne accounting for 83% of outbreak cases. Case-control studies indicate strong risk associations with environmental exposure in Scotland, the UK as a whole and the USA, but burgers appear to be more of a risk in the USA. Canadian, Scottish and Swedish disease mapping studies found positive association with indicators of cattle density. In Grampian (North-East Scotland) we found that there was a positive association with cattle and sheep density (divided by human population density) as well as percentage of population on private water supplies. We found 63% of cases in rural postcodes compared with 37% urban after correcting for population differences suggesting that at least 26% of cases may be classified as environmental. QMRA showed that on average, the risk was 100 times greater when visiting a pasture than eating a burger in Grampian. However, it is difficult to determine which pathway actually causes most illnesses as it is unknown how many burgers are consumed daily and what is the frequency of human visits to pasture. The implementation of hygienic food processing post-1996 Central Scotland outbreak and the preference for 'well done' burgers may account for this food being a relatively low risk thus making the 'burger bug' term less appropriate in the UK."

By monitoring the referred gas emissions with a dynamic flux chamber for seven consecutive days, we examined their emission rates. An annual hourly emission time series was constructed on the basis of the measured emission rates and a release modification model. The health risk of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide emissions around the dairy farm was then determined using atmospheric dispersion modeling and exposure risk assessment. The body mass-related mean emission factors of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide were 2.13 kg a-1 AU-1 and 24.9 g a-1 AU-1, respectively (one animal unit (AU) is equivalent to 500 kg body mass). A log-normal distribution fitted well to ammonia emission rates. Contour lines of predicted hourly mean concentrations of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide were mainly driven by the meteorological conditions. The concentrations of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide at the fence line were below 10 μg m-3 and 0.04 μg m-3, respectively, and were 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than the current Chinese air quality standards for such pollutants. Moreover, the cumulative non-carcinogenic risks (HI) of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide were 4 orders of magnitudes lower than the acceptable risk levels (HI = 1). Considering a health risk criterion of 1E-4, the maximum distance from the farm fence line to meet this criterion was nearly 1000 m towards north-northeast. The encompassed area of the contour lines of the ambient concentration of ammonia is much larger than that of hydrogen sulfide. However, the contour lines of the ammonia health risk are analogous to those of hydrogen sulfide.

Oxidative changes in AA residues were measured by PC. Dityrosine and N'-formylkynurenine (NFK), a carbonylation derivative of Trp, were measured by fluorometry. Protein carbonyls increased as a function of irradiation time for both WM and SM. The initial rate for PC formation by exposure to FL light (0.25 or 0.27 nmol/h for WM and SM, respectively) was slower than that following exposure to UV light (1.95 or 1.20 nmol/h, respectively). The time course of NFK formation resembled that of PC. After 24h of UV exposure, SM had significantly higher levels of NFK than did WM. In contrast, WM samples irradiated with UV had higher levels of DiTyr than did SM samples, indicating different molecular pathways. The formation of intra- or intermolecular DiTyr bonds could be indicative of changes in the tertiary structure or oligomerization of proteins. The existence of NFK suggests the occurrence of protein fragmentation. Thus, proteolysis and oligomerization were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE. After 24h of exposing WM to UV or FL light, all the proteins were affected by both types of light, as evidenced by loss of material in most of the bands. Aggregates were produced only by UV irradiation. Hydrolysis by pepsin and enzyme-induced coagulation by rennet were performed to evaluate altered biological properties of the oxidized proteins.

The study was carried out with to determine the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance pattern of E. coli O157:H7 along the dairy supply chains in Akaki Kaliti sub-city of Addis Ababa, Bishoftu and Sululta towns of central Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study design with random sampling methods was employed. Thus, a total of 450 raw cow milk (294), milker hand swab (65) and water (91) samples were collected from dairy farms, milk collection centers and Cafeterias and processed according to the standards to isolate and identify E. coli O157:H7. The samples were initially enriched in buffered peptone water, then plated onto Sorbitol MacConkey agar. Consequently, the suspected non-sorbitol fermenting colonies were confirmed as E. coli biochemically and serological test using latex agglutination tests. Out of the total 450 samples examined, 6.0% were found to be contaminated by E. coli O157:H7. Accordingly, 9.89% of water, 9.23% of milker hand swab and 4.08% of raw milk samples were contaminated by the pathogen. Furthermore, the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 was 7.79%, 6.21% and 3.97% in Akaki kaliti sub-city, Sululta and Bishoftu towns, respectively. The result of Fisher exact analysis revealed a significant difference observed (p < 0.05) between the occurrence of the pathogen and the source of sample, sources of water used, sampled material and type of containers. The study also revealed that varying level of resistance of E. coli O157:H7 isolates against nine antimicrobial discs tested and 100% (n = 27) of the isolates showed multidrug-resistance comprising from two up to seven antimicrobial drugs. In conclusion, this study has indicated the occurrence of E. coli O157:H7 and its multiple drug-resistant profiles in milk samples along the dairy supply chains and its risk to public health and food safety.

Among the five enrichment broths tested, C. difficile moxalactam norfloxacin boullion (CDMN) was the only one that allowed recovery of C. difficile from artificially spiked meat samples. Use of Tween 80 as a detergent in the enrichment of artificially contaminated bactofugates improved recovery of C. difficile. Following the enrichment procedures (meat without the use of TWEEN 80), one hundred ground meat samples and fifty bactofugates were enriched for 10-15days in CDMN and presumed positive colonies were isolated and identified by Gram staining, observation of colony fluorescence and ID 32 A ribotyping. Subsequently PCR ribotyping, PCR-based identification of toxin genes (tcdA, tcdB) and antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing to metronidazole, vancomycin, clindamycin and moxifloxacin were performed. C. difficile was isolated from three (3%) of the one hundred retail ground meat samples. Two C. difficile isolates of the same rare ribotype AI-57 were toxin gene-negative and sensitive to all antibiotics tested. One isolate was assignable to one of the most prevalent clinical ribotypes isolated in Austria and harboured the tcdA and tcdB genes. This isolate was also resistant to clindamycin and moxifloxacin. None of the fifty bactofugates tested were positive for C. difficile. The presence of an isolate of human origin could indicate contamination by human shedders during food processing rather than evidencing zoonotic potential. Bactofugates, although constituting concentrated spore suspensions, were not contaminated with C. difficile spores. This finding excludes raw milk as a major source of food contamination. In conclusion, C. difficile recovery rates found in our study were lower than expected from the literature. Sources other than zoonotic origin must be considered when studying the epidemiology of community acquired infections with this bacterium."

School milk products consumed on June 8 were suspected as the source of the outbreak. On June 8, the milk products provided by local dairy X to eight elementary schools and two nurseries. The short incubation period - all cases fell ill on the day on which the products were consumed - and the short duration of illness (1-2 days) strongly suggested intoxication. In order to identify the causative pathogen, its reservoir and the mode of transmission, a descriptive-epidemiological and microbiological investigation and a retrospective cohort study were conducted. Six of the 10 institutions served by dairy X completed questionnaires on demographics and food consumption. One school had a 79% response rate (203/258) and was chosen as the basis for our cohort study. A total of 166 of the 1025 children (16.2%) at the 10 institutions fulfilled the case definition. Consumption of milk, cacao milk or vanilla milk originating from dairy X was associated with a 37.8 times higher risk of becoming a case (95% CI: 2.3-116.5). Unopened milk products left over at the affected institutions yielded staphylococcal enterotoxins A and D. Six out of 64 quarter milk samples from three of 16 cows producing milk for dairy X tested positive for S. aureus. The isolates produced enterotoxins A and D, yielded genes encoding enterotoxins and D, and showed spa type t2953. S. aureus isolated from the nasal swab of the dairy owner harbored genes encoding enterotoxins C, G, H and I, and showed spa type t635. Our investigation revealed that the milk products produced in dairy X on June 7 were the source of the outbreak on June 8. The cows - not the dairy owner - the likely reservoir of the enterotoxin-producing S. aureus. From the risk assessment of the production process at the dairy, we hypothesize that staphylococcal toxin production took place during a 3-day period of storage of pasteurized milk prior to repasteurization for the production batch of 7."

Dictionary: {}</s>",{'Foods': ['Milk']}</s>,"BACKGROUND:Milk is a nutrient-rich food that makes an important contribution to diets in several Low and Middle Income Countries such as Senegal. Milk can also harbour several pathogenic microorganisms. As in other low and middle income countries, the dairy industry in Senegal is growing, with an expansion of farms to meet rapidly growing demand in the cities. However, most of the production still happens in the informal sector, and little is known about consumption of milk and milk products, or knowledge, awareness and practices of actors in informal dairy supply chains. METHODS:We conducted structured focus group discussions with dairy farmers and milk processors in three selected regions (Dakar, Thies and Fatick) in Senegal to investigate the consumption practices, awareness of milk borne hazards, and practices relevant to the risk of milk contamination to gain a deeper understanding of drivers of milk-borne diseases. Data on the consumption of milk and milk products were also collected using a closed questionnaire. RESULTS:Results indicate that milk is an important part of the diet in the study regionsand raw milk consumption is very common. The most common milk product consumed was fermented milk. Awareness of milk borne hazards was limited. Several farmers and processors reported risky practices, despite being aware of better practices, due to cultural beliefs. In households, children, pregnant women and older people were prioritised when milk and milk products were distributed. Dairy farmers and milk processors were more concerned with the lack of food for animals, low production and seasonality of production than the safety of the milk and milk products. CONCLUSIONS:Lack of awareness of milk borne infections and some traditional practices put milk and milk product consumers in the study area at high risk of milk borne diseases.. Prioritising certain sub population at households (Pregnant women and children) makes then vulnerable to milk-borne hazards. It will be challenging to change the risky practices as they are motivated by cultural beliefs hence the best strategy to promote milk safety will be to encourage the boiling of milk by consumers."

The review was limited to dairy cattle, beef cattle, pigs, broilers and laying hens, and to Europe, North America and New Zealand. Results per indicators are presented as in the articles without performing additional calculations. Out of 4171 initial search hits, 179 articles were analysed. Studies varied widely in indicators, research design, sample size and location and context. Quite some studies used small samples. No study analysed all aspects of sustainability simultaneously. Conventional systems had lower labour requirements per unit product, lower income risk per animal, higher production per animal per time unit, higher reproduction numbers, lower feed conversion ratio, lower land use, generally lower acidification and eutrophication potential per unit product, equal or better udder health for cows and equal or lower microbiological contamination. Organic systems had higher income per animal or full time employee, lower impact on biodiversity, lower eutrophication and acidification potential per unit land, equal or lower likelihood of antibiotic resistance in bacteria and higher beneficial fatty acid levels in cow milk. For most sustainability aspects, sometimes conventional and sometimes organic systems performed better, except for productivity, which was consistently higher in conventional systems.

The dairy products sampled included various cheeses (American, cheddar, Swiss, cottage), ice cream, yogurt, butter, and milk. The finfish and shellfish (molluscs and crustacea) sampled are those marine species consumed in the greatest amounts and include canned tuna, shrimp, cod, blue crab, and oysters.

Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for each congener in each food were reported. Point estimates of exposure were calculated using a 3-day (1-day diary plus 2-day recall) food consumption survey for eaters-only and for the general population (USDA/CSFII, 1989-92). Toxicity equivalency factors (TEFs) developed by the World Health Organization (1997) were used to derive overall dioxin/furan toxicity equivalents (TEQ) for each sample food. Mean estimates of TEQ exposure for each food were derived using five values for non-detects (ND = 0; ND = 1/2 LOD or LOQ, ND = LOD or LOQ) on both a total sample and eaters-only basis. Using zero and the LOD provide lower and upper bounds on the range of estimated exposure, respectively. The bounds on mean dioxin intakes (pg/person/day) calculated for consumers of specific foods were estimated as follows (using zero or LOD for non-detects): butter (0.5-11), cheese (1.6-3.2), ice cream (4-19), yogurt (0.8-28), catfish (148-150), fish (other than catfish) (0.03-9), crustacea (32-35), mollusks (16.1-16.6), and shrimp (0.09-4.5). Exposure estimates derived by the five ND-methods are strongly dependent on the LOD and LOQ and represent upper bound estimates of exposure.

In general, the hygienic quality of farm-dairy cheeses appeared to be of an acceptable microbiological quality, e. g. L. monocytogenes and staphylococcal enterotoxin were not detected in cheese samples. However, E. coli and enterotoxigenic S. aureus were frequently found in raw milk cheeses and sometimes at levels that are of concern, especially in fresh cheese. Interestingly, levels in raw milk fresh cheese were significantly lower when starter cultures were used. Up to five S. aureus colonies per cheese, if possible, were characterized and about 70% of isolates carried one or more enterotoxin genes, most common were sec and sea. The Ovine biotype (73%) was most common among isolates from goat milk cheese and the Human biotype (60%) from cow milk cheese. Of all isolates, 39% showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin, but the proportion of isolates from cows' cheese (66%) compared to isolates from goats' cheese (27%) was significantly higher. S. aureus isolates with different properties were detected in cheese from the same farm and, sometimes even the same cheese. Isolates with the same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)-pattern were detected on geographically distant dairies. This indicates that multiple sources and routes of contamination are important. To improve the safety of these products efforts to raise awareness of the importance of hygiene barriers and raw milk quality as well as improved process control can be suggested, e. g. use of starter cultures and monitoring of fermentation with a pH-meter.

The mean counts of contaminated samples of TBC, SC, and CC were 8.94 ± 0.46 Standard Deviation (SD), 8.52 ± 0.6 SD, and 8.78 ± 0.49 SD log CFU/ml, respectively. The proportion of contamination was significantly lower in milk collected from dairy farms (32/96, 33.3, 95% CI: 24.5-43.2) compared to milk from vendors (33/51, 64.7, 95% CI: 51.4-66.2) and cafeterias (99/168, 58.9, 95% CI, 50.9-76.85). The milk samples were culture-positive for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, K. oxytoca and Citrobacter freundii. Over half of the sampled raw milk exhibited bacterial contamination with increasing trend from farmers to points of sale. Thus, milk vendors and cafeteria owners should apply good hygienic and sanitation practices during handling of milk; use appropriate, clean containers, and cold chain during milk transportation; and refrigeration of milk during storage."

However, the Commission Regulation No 2073/2005 on microbiological criteria for foodstuffs requires that food business operators ensure that foodstuffs comply with the relevant microbiological criteria. Such criteria define the acceptability of a product, a batch of foodstuffs or a process, based on the absence, presence or number of micro-organisms, and/or on the quantity of their toxins/metabolites, per unit(s) of mass, volume, area or batch. The same Regulation describes a food safety criterion as a mean to define the acceptability of a product or a batch of foodstuff applicable to products placed on the market; moreover, it states a process hygiene criterion as a mean indicating the acceptable functioning of the production process. Both food safety criteria and process hygiene criteria are not based on risk analysis. On the contrary, the metrics formulated by the Codex Alimentarius Commission in 2004, named Food Safety Objective (FSO) and Performance Objective (PO), are risk-based and fit the indications of Regulation 178/2002. The main aims of this review are to illustrate the key differences between microbiological criteria and the risk-based metrics defined by the Codex Alimentarius Commission and to explore the opportunity and also the possibility to implement future European Regulations including PO and FSO as supporting parameters to microbiological criteria. This review clarifies also the implications of defining an appropriate level of human protection, how to establish FSO and PO and how to implement them in practice linked to each other through quantitative risk assessment models. The contents of this review should clarify the context for application of the results collected during the EU funded project named BASELINE (www. baselineeurope. eu) as described in the papers of this special issue. Such results show how to derive POs for specific food/biological hazard combinations selected among fish, egg, dairy, meat and plant products."

This paper reviews the prevalence of foodborne pathogens in seven African countries (Benin, Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan and Uganda) from papers in regional or international journals published between January 2000 and December 2015. One hundred and sixteen publications that dealt with food microbiology were reviewed for general analysis, while 66 papers on contamination of pathogenic bacteria were used for meta-analysis of prevalence. The food items were split into two categories: raw foods and ready-to-eat (RTE) foods (including street food and beverages) for meta-analysis. Majority of the reviewed studies (67.2%, 78/116) dealt with food of animal origin: 38.8% for meat and eggs, 17.2% for dairy products and 11.2% for aquatic products. Only 8.6% examined foods of plant origin (fruits and vegetables). The remaining 24.1% was the composite RTE food and beverages. Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes were the most frequently reported organisms in those studies. Although the data were highly heterogeneous, a striking feature is high prevalence of the major pathogens in RTE foods, almost as high as in raw foods. E. coli averaged at 37.6% in raw foods and 31.6% in RTE foods. The corresponding prevalence for Salmonella was 19.9% vs 21.7%; S. aureus, 27.8% vs 25.1% and L. monocytogenes, 19.5% vs 6.7%. The average prevalence of foodborne pathogens in these countries was 34.2% (29.0-39.3%). Differences in food types as well as non-uniform protocols for sampling and identification might have contributed to high heterogeneity (I2 >97%) although some high prevalence data could be factual with extensive varieties of raw and RTE foods. Need for improved hygienic practices in handling of raw or RTE foods are suggested. Implementation of surveillance programs that use uniform laboratory protocols across the region could give homogeneous results."

A total of 114 samples made up of 25 soil collected from cattle grazing farm land, 30 raw milk, 28 nunu (yoghurt-like product) and 31 woagashie (West African soft cheese). Ninety-six B. cereus sensu lato isolates from 54 positive samples were screened by PCR for the presence of 8 enterotoxigenic genes (hblA, hblC, hblD, nheA, nheB, nheC, cytK and entFM), and one emetic gene (ces). Phenotypic resistance to 15 antibiotics were also determined for 96 B. cereus sensu lato isolates.

In view of this, we investigated the possible presence of (anti)androgenic contaminants in raw and commercialized milk samples. For this purpose, a novel HepARE-Luc cell line that stably expresses human androgen receptor (AR) and the androgen responsive luciferase reporter gene was generated and used in the present study. Treatment of this cell line with androgens and corresponding antiandrogen (flutamide) stimulated or inhibited expression of reporter luciferase, respectively. Real time polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining results exhibited transcription response and translocation of AR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to androgen. Observations implied that a cell-based xenobiotic screening assay via AR response can be conducted for assessing the (anti)androgenic ligands present in food chain including milk. Therefore, the cell line was further used to screen the (anti)androgenic activity of a total of 40 milk fat samples procured as raw or commercial milk. Some of the raw and commercial milk fat samples distinctly showed antiandrogenic activities. Subsequently, some commonly used environmental chemicals were also evaluated for their (anti)androgenic activities. Initial observations with molecular docking studies of experimental compounds were performed to assess their interaction with AR ligand binding domain. Furthermore, (anti)androgenic activities of these compounds were confirmed by performing luciferase assay using the HepARE-Luc cell line. None of the test compounds showed androgenic activities rather some of them like Bisphenol A (BPA) and rifamycin showed antiandrogenic activities. In conclusion, our results provide a valuable information about the assessment of (anti)androgenic activities present in milk samples. Overall, it is proposed that a robust cell-based CALUX assay can be used to assess the (anti)androgenic activities present in milk which can be attributed to different environmental chemicals present therein."

Fertilizers, including a standard synthetic fertilizer (CON), straight lagoon raw manure (SL), anaerobically digested liquid effluent (DLE), compost (COM) and dairy manure-derived refined fertilizers including ammonium sulfate (AS) and phosphorous solid (PS), were randomly applied in quadruplicate to raspberry plots. Soil, fertilizer, foliar, and raspberry fruit samples were collected during the cropping season for the quantification of indicator microorganisms (total coliform and generic Escherichia coli) and detection of important foodborne pathogens (Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), Salmonella, and Listeria monocytogenes). Counts of total coliforms in soil were stable over the 2017 cropping season and were not impacted by fertilizer application. In 2018, total coliforms increased with season and soils treated with COM had a significantly higher coliform number than those treated with CON. Both total coliform and generic E. coli in raspberry fruit samples were below the detectable level (3 most probable number/g) regardless of fertilizer types. In both years, no STEC or L. monocytogenes was detected from any of the collected samples regardless of fertilizer treatments. However, Salmonella were detected in some of the fertilizers, including PS (2017), DLE (2018), and SL (2018), which were transferred to soil samples taken directly after application of these fertilizers. Salmonella were not detected in soil samples 2 or 4 months post fertilizer application, foliar, or raspberry fruit samples regardless of fertilizer applications. In summary, one-time application of raw dairy manure or dairy manure-derived fertilizers more than 4 months prior to harvest has no major impact on food safety of red raspberry (6 ft. tall) production in Lynden sandy loam under good agricultural practices."

In this study, we employed Monte Carlo simulation to assess the risk of shedding extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli (ESC-R E. coli) caused by waste milk feeding in pre-weaned calves using an exponential dose-response model fit to data for E. coli O157:H7 in cattle. Data from pertinent studies were included in our model to predict the risk of shedding. The median (5th and 95th percentiles) for the daily risk of shedding ESC-R E. coli by calves fed only contaminated waste milk was predicted to be 2.9 × 10-3 (2.1 × 10-3, 3.7 × 10-3), representing a median daily risk of 29 out of 10,000 calves shedding ESC-R E. coli due to exclusive feeding of waste milk containing ESC-R E. coli. This median value was reduced by 94% when accounting for the proportion of waste milk that does not contain ESC-R E. coli. The overall risk of shedding ESC-R E. coli through the pre-weaning period for farms that feed waste milk to calves was 5.7 × 10-3 (2.4 × 10-3, 1.1 × 10-2), representing 57 out of 10,000 calves. When accounting for the proportion of farms that do not feed waste milk, the pre-weaning period risk was reduced by 23%. By varying the prevalence of ESC-R E. coli in waste milk using values of 3, 1.5, and 1%, the daily risk of shedding decreased by factors of 50, 65, and 82%, respectively, which supports the reduction of contamination or discontinuation of feeding waste milk containing ESC-R E. coli as major mitigation measures to reduce the risk of shedding caused by ingestion of resistant bacteria. It is anticipated that the effects of antimicrobial residues in waste milk, which was not considered herein due to lack of data, would further increase risks. Although waste milk feeding to calves may be economically beneficial to the dairy farmers, there exists the risk of dissemination of ESC-resistant bacteria into the environment."

These bio-based fertilizers have heterogeneous nutrient and metal contents, resulting in a range of possible application rates. To avoid nutrient losses to water or bioaccumulation of metals in soil or crops, it is important that rates applied to land are safe and adhere to the maximum legal application rates similar to inorganic fertilizers. This study collected and analysed nutrient and metal content of all major DPS (n = 84) and DPS-derived STRUBIAS products (n = 10), and created an application calculator in MS Excel™ to provide guidance on maximum legal application rates for ryegrass and spring wheat across plant available phosphorus (P) deficient soil to P-excess soil. The sample analysis showed that raw DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS have high P contents ranging from 10.1 to 122 g kg-1. Nitrogen (N) in DPS was high, whereas N concentrations decreased in thermo-chemical STRUBIAS products (chars and ash) due to the high temperatures used in their formation. The heavy metal content of DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS was significantly lower than the EU imposed limits. Using the calculator, application rates of DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS materials (dry weight) ranged from 0 to 4.0 tonnes ha-1 y-1 for ryegrass and 0-4.5 tonnes ha-1 y-1 for spring wheat. The estimated heavy metal ingestion to soil annually by the application of the DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS products was lower than the EU guideline on soil metal accumulation. The calculator is adaptable for any bio-based fertilizer, soil and crop type, and future work should continue to characterise and incorporate new DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS products into the database presented in this paper. In addition, safe application rates pertaining to other regulated pollutants or emerging contaminants that may be identified in these products should be included. The fertilizer replacement value of these products, taken from long-term field studies, should be factored into application rates."

This chapter covers some of the chemotherapeutic approaches undertaken at population level to control infectious diseases in domestic animals. Optimisation of health, productivity and welfare in livestock commonly entails implementation of whole-herd or whole-flock strategies to effectively counter the negative impact of infectious diseases. Gastro-intestinal and liver parasites of grazing cattle and sheep are endemic in most parts of the world and can result in significant production losses. Strategically timed anthelmintic treatments are instituted with the double objective of reducing worm burdens in infected animals and ensuring reduction of pasture contamination with infective larvae. Mastitis is another major endemic problem, particularly in cattle, which causes significant economic losses to dairy farmers globally. As a painful inflammatory condition of the cow's udder, clinical mastitis also raises animal welfare concerns. Prevention of clinical mastitis requires rigorous post-milking hygiene, identification and culling of chronically infected cows, attention to the cow's environment and therapeutic management of udder health during the dry period. A third condition that can cause high levels of morbidity and mortality is bacterial respiratory disease. Pneumonia in young livestock is often exacerbated by stressful transportation and co-mingling of animals from different herds. The welfare consequences and production losses can be significant. Antimicrobial treatment of pneumonic animals and, when appropriate, of in-contact animals living in the same air-space is an integral part of whole-herd respiratory disease management. The role of the veterinary profession is to also ensure that principles of population medicine are understood and adhered to by pet owners. The increase in pet ownership and the importance of the human-animal bond in modern developed societies give rise to zoonotic risks, which require vigilance and intervention. Regular internal parasite control in dogs and cats, particularly in endemic areas, contributes to animal welfare and minimises public health hazards."

Raw milk samples were analyzed in laboratory and semi-structured interview questions and observational checklists were administered to collect data on the amount and frequency of consumption. Statistical analysis of data obtained from laboratory results and questionnaire surveys were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 23. Among the total of 150 raw milk samples collected from the study area, about 61.3% were found to be contaminated by one or more types of pathogens along the dairy value chain. The highest and the least bacterial counts recorded from E. coli and L. monocytogenes contamination in the milk were 4.88 log 10 cfu/ml and 3.45 log 10 cfu/ml respectively; whereas Campylobacter jejuni were totally absent in the retailer outlets. The mean concentrations of all pathogens demonstrated significant statistical difference (p < 0.05) using 95% confidence interval where the prevalence percentage of isolates increased as milk transported from dairy farms to the retail outlets. All pathogens were detected in the unsatisfactory level along the dairy value chain, particularly at retail outlets, where raw milk is ready for consumption. The estimated mean annual risk of acquiring intoxication of E. coli across retailer outlets is 100% whereas salmonellosis, S. aureus intoxication, and listeriosis are 84%, 65% and 63% respectively. The results of our study, therefore, demonstrated that the high annual probability of infection could be ascribed to the traditional production and consumption patterns of raw milk in Ethiopia. Consuming such ready-to-eat foods with unacceptable microbiological quality is one of the concerns that develop public health risks that increase the chance of food-borne illness. Hence, it requires regular monitoring and implementing hazard identification and critical control point principles along raw milk production to retail points."

To develop antifungal cultures for the dairy product biopreservation, experiments were conducted both in vitro and in situ. Firstly, the antifungal activity of 32 strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and propionibacteria was screened alone, and then on combinations based on 5 selected lactobacilli strains. This screening was performed in yogurt and cheese models against four major spoilage fungi previously isolated from contaminated dairy products (Penicillium commune, Mucor racemosus, Galactomyces geotrichum, and Yarrowia lipolytica). Selected combinations were then tested as adjunct cultures in sour cream and semi-hard cheeses produced at a pilot scale to evaluate their antifungal activity during challenge tests against selected fungal targets (P. commune, M. racemosus, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa) and shelf life tests; and their impact on product organoleptic properties. The screening step allowed selecting two binary combinations, A1 and A3 composed of Lactobacillus plantarum L244 and either Lactobacillus harbinensis L172 or Lactobacillus rhamnosus CIRM-BIA1113, respectively. In situ assays showed that the A1 combination delayed the growth of P. commune, M. racemosus and R. mucilaginosa for 2-24 days on sour cream depending of the antifungal culture inoculum, without effect on organoleptic properties at low inoculum (106 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL). Moreover, the A1 and A3 combinations also delayed the growth of P. commune in semi-hard cheese for 1-6 days and 1 day, respectively. Antifungal cultures neither impacted the growth of starter cultures in both sour cream and cheese nor the products' pH, although post acidification was observed in sour cream supplemented with these combinations at the highest concentrations (2.107 CFU/mL). The combination of both in vitro and in situ screening assays allowed developing 2 antifungal combinations exhibiting significant antifungal activity and providing future prospects for use as bioprotective cultures in dairy products."

Multiple virulence factors can be involved simultaneously during the pathogenesis of a staphylococcal disease, including adhesion proteins, extracellular enzymes, and toxins. The main objective of this study was to assess virulence factors that are associated with cow intramammary infection (IMI) and of human health concern among Staph. aureus isolates obtained from bulk tank milk (BTM) and adherences on milking equipment surfaces. A total of 166 Staph. aureus isolates from 23 dairy farms were characterized according to their virulence profiles. For virulence factors of importance in IMI, the presence of the virulence markers thermonuclease (nuc) and coagulase (coa) and virulence genes such as fibronectin (fnbA) and intercellular adhesion (icaA, icaD) were assessed. For virulence factors of public health concern, presence of antimicrobial resistance (mecA and mecC) and enterotoxin (sea and seb) genes were analyzed. Among all Staph. aureus isolates, 5 virulence profiles were found; the profile nuc(+)coa(+)fnbA(+)icaA(+)icaD(+)mecA(-)mecC(-)sea(-)seb(-) was the most frequently observed (21 out of 23 dairy farms). No differences were found between the virulence profile frequencies of Staph. aureus from BTM and adherences on milking equipment surfaces. The virulence profiles most frequently observed included genes involved in the adherence and biofilm-forming ability of Staph. aureus, which could represent a potential advantage for the bacterium during the early stages of IMI colonization and for persistence on surfaces. Our results indicate a greater frequency of virulence factors of importance for IMI pathogenesis than virulence factors of public health concern, consistent with the dairy origin of isolates. The mecA, mecC, and seb genes were not observed among Staph. aureus isolates analyzed in this study. However, the sea gene was detected in 3 Staph. aureus isolated from BTM, thus posing a potential public health threat. Our results emphasize the importance of understanding the epidemiology and dynamics of Staph. aureus on dairy farms as a tool for the improvement of udder health and milk safety."

Methods A total of 130 concentrate feedstuff samples were collected in paper bags from 113 randomly selected farms in the three agroecological zones (representing high, mid and low (lakeshore) altitudes) from October and December 2019. Each feed sample was ground and analyzed for total aflatoxin and zearalenone using VICAM Fluorometer Method procedures. Results About 85% of samples comprised of corn (maize) bran (CB), 8% for pigeon pea (PP), 2% for dairy mash, 1% for soybean and <1% for sunflower, rice bran (RB) and rice bran mixed with maize bran respectively. 75% of corn bran and 100% of dairy mash and rice bran samples were positive for zearalenone (i. e. above 100 μg/kg) while other concentrates tested negative. Incidences of total aflatoxin were 32%, 67% and 9% in CB, DM and PP bran samples respectively and negligible in other concentrates. Overall, 32% and 23% of feedstuffs had total aflatoxin concentrations above regulatory limits set by Malawi’s neighboring countries (Tanzania and Mozambique) and US respectively whereas only 6% of all the concentrate feedstuffs had zearalenone concentrations above the regulatory limit enforced by EU. Levels of total aflatoxin and zearalenone in CB were not affected by agroecological zones (P=0.17 and P=0.87) respectively.

Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report prevalence of various mycotoxins in dairy concentrate feedstuffs in Malawi. Aflatoxin and zearalenone contamination in dairy concentrates exist but mostly in levels within tolerable limits at least from the limited timeframe of this study. However, presence of total aflatoxin above regulatory limits in 26 - 34% of corn bran, a major concentrate feedstuff, points to the need for deliberate efforts to ensure levels are kept low in dairy animal feeds for both safety of dairy animals and consumers in Malawi."

In 2005, after a school trip to a dairy farm, 22 out of a group of 34 children developed diarrhoeal illness and Campylobacterjejuni was cultured from the stool samples of 11 of the cases. The illness was found to be epidemiologically associated with drinking raw milk during the farm visit; 86% of the cases could be explained by drinking raw milk. C. jejuni was also isolated from three of 10 faecal samples from dairy cattle collected at the farm. The human isolates and C. jejuni isolates from one of these three samples of cattle faeces revealed identical restriction patterns by both pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and flagellin (fla) typing by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Both epidemiological and bacteriological evidence implicated contaminated raw milk as the vehicle of transmission, though C. jejuni was not isolated from the bulk tank milk or the milk filter collected during the farm investigation. In 2007, an outbreak of enteritis was notified among people who had attended a lunch at a dairy farm where bulk tank milk was served. Of the 19 persons who had consumed raw milk, 16 (84%) had become ill. Of the persons who did not drink the raw milk, none became ill. A significant association was found between tasting the raw milk and being ill (risk difference=0.84, p=0.0011). C. jejuni was cultured from four of seven cases who had submitted a stool specimen. C. jejuni was also isolated from a sample of bulk tank milk and the isolate had an identical flaA PCR-RFLP genotype to isolates obtained from patients. Also in this outbreak both the epidemiological and bacteriological findings support raw milk as the vehicle for the enteritis. These two outbreaks highlight the health risks associated with the consumption of raw milk. As long as legislation allows the sale and distribution of untreated milk these risks will continue. Therefore, consumers need to be continuously informed about the dangers inherent in consuming unpasteurised milk or products made from raw milk. Farmers need to be strongly discouraged from serving raw milk to their visitors."

A sensitive and reliable method for the analysis of benzalkonium chlorides (BACs) and dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides (DDACs) has been developed that enables the simultaneous quantitative determination of ten quaternary ammonium residues in dairy products below the provisional maximum residue level (MRL), set at 0.1mgkg-1. To the best of our knowledge, this method could be the one applicable to milk and to three major processed milk products selected, namely processed or hard pressed cheeses, and whole milk powder. The method comprises solvent extraction using a mixture of acetonitrile and ethyl acetate, without any further clean-up. Analyses were performed by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-ESI-MS/MS) operating in positive mode. A C18 analytical column was used for chromatographic separation, with a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and water both containing 0.3% formic acid; and methanol in the gradient mode. Five deuterated internal standards were added to obtain the most accurate quantification. Extraction recoveries were satisfactory and no matrix effects were observed. The method was validated using the total error approach in accordance with the NF V03-110 standard in order to characterize the trueness, repeatability, intermediate precision and analytical limits within the range of 5-150μgkg-1 for all matrices. These performance criteria, calculated by e. noval® 3.0 software, were satisfactory and in full accordance with the proposed provisional MRL and with the recommendations in the European Union SANTE/11945/2015 regulatory guidelines. The limit of detection (LOD) was low (<1.9μgkg-1) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) ranged from 5μgkg-1 to 35μgkg-1 for all matrices depending on the analytes. The validation results proved that the method is suitable for quantifying quaternary ammoniums in foodstuffs from dairy industries at residue levels, and could be used for biocide residues monitoring plans and to measure the exposition consumer to biocides products."

Detection of the heat-resistance markers clpK and orfI by PCR was followed by phenotypical confirmation of increased heat-resistance. These strains were Shiga toxin-negative and, although several were found to be multidrug resistant, no plasmids encoding extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) were found in any of the isolates. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of these strains to acquire ESBL plasmids and a modified Shiga toxin-encoding phage. Only 4 ESBL-encoding, heat-sensitive E. coli strains were isolated from 1,251 dairy samples (2/455 raw milk and 2/796 raw milk cheese samples). One incompatibility group FII plasmid (CTX-M-14, 79.0 kb) and 3 incompatibility group I1 plasmids (CTX-M-15, 95.2, 96.1, and 97.8 kb) were fully sequenced and de novo assembled. All 4 plasmids are readily transferred to heat-resistant E. coli isolates in plate matings (9.7×10-5 to 3.7×10-1 exconjugants per recipient) and, to a lesser extent, in milk (up to 7.4×10-5 exconjugants per recipient). Importantly, the plasmids are stably maintained during passaging in liquid media without antimicrobial pressure. The heat-resistant isolate FAM21805 was also shown to be capable of acting as donor of all 4 ESBL plasmids. In addition, 3 of 11 tested ESBL exconjugants of heat-resistant strains were lysogenized by the modified Shiga toxin-encoding phage 933W ∆stx::gfp::cat. The higher fraction of heat-resistant E. coli (93 of 256 isolates) compared with the estimated 2% previously predicted based on genomic prevalence of heat resistance genes seems to indicate a selection advantage in the raw milk cheese production environment. The combination of 2 factors may lead to said advantage: increased survival during thermization of raw milk (heating to subpasteurization temperatures) and increased survival rates during cheese ripening. Should these strains acquire ESBL-encoding plasmids, Shiga toxin-encoding phages, or both, these genetic elements would profit from the selection advantage of their host and become more abundant in this particular environment, which in turn could lead to an increased threat to consumers of raw milk products."

This cross-sectional study, carried out in the North West region of Cameroon, sought to determine the prevalence of bovine mastitis, coliforms associated with bovine mastitis, risk factors for infection and the antibiotic resistance pattern of coliform bacterial isolates. A total of 1608 udder quarters were sampled from 411 cows using a questionnaire, clinical examination, California Mastitis Test and milk culture. Primary isolation of coliform bacteria was done on MacConkey agar while identification of coliforms employed Gram-staining and biochemical testing. Each coliform bacterial isolate was challenged with 11 antibiotics using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The prevalence of mastitis was 53.0% (218/411) and 33.1% (532/1608) at the cow- and quarter-levels respectively. Overall, 21.9% (90/411) cows and 8.2% (132/1608) udder quarters showed coliform mastitis. Escherichia coli was isolated in 7.0% of mastitis milk, and other coliforms isolated were Enterobacter cloacae (12.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.4%), Enterobacter sakazakii (1.1%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.8%), Citrobacter freudii (0.4%), Serratia ficaria (0.4%) and Serratia liquefaciens (0.2%). Lactation stage, breed, history of mastitis and moist/muddy faeces contaminated environment were significantly associated (P-value < 0.05) with coliform mastitis. Coliform isolates (99.0%; 203/205) were resistant to at least one antibiotic tested. Amoxicillin had the highest resistance (88.8%) while norfloxacin had the least resistance (3.4%). Multidrug resistance was exhibited by 52.7% (108/205) of the isolates in a proportion of 27.8% Enterobacter cloacae, 10.7% E. coli, 6.3% Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.9% Enterobacter sakazakii, 2.0% Klebsiella oxytoca, 1.0% Citrobacter freundii, 1.0% Serratia ficaria, 0.5% Serratia liquefaciens and 0.5% Serratia odorifera.

Of 868 food samples tested (diverse meat samples including antelope, duck, guinea pig, pork, rodents, turkey, dairy products, and eggs), 136 (15.7%) were positive for S. aureus and 26 (3.0%) for MRSA. All MRSA strains were mecA-positive. The prevalence of S. aureus-positive dairy samples among food confiscated at Bilbao International Airport was 64.6%, and this airport also had the highest value (11.8%) for MRSA-positive samples. The predominant sequence type was ST5 (30.8%), followed by ST8, ST1649, ST1, and other lineages were found to a lesser extent (ST7, ST22, ST72, ST97, and ST398). Six isolates tested positive for luk-PVL genes (SCCmec IV subtypes IVc and IVe). Enterotoxin profiling revealed that 19 MRSA strains were enterotoxigenic, harboring one or more se genes. The MRSA isolates positive for luk-PVL genes were not enterotoxigenic, and none of the isolates tested positive for enterotoxin E. We found 14 resistance profiles, and more than 69% of the MRSA isolates were resistant to three or more types of antimicrobial agents. This finding reveals both the wide diversity of the antimicrobial resistance found in the strains and the capacity to resist not only to beta-lactam drugs. One MRSA strain showed unusual characteristics: it was oxacillin-susceptible, harbored SCCmec V, and was positive for sed, seg, and sej but negative for PVL virulence factors. This study shows the presence of enterotoxigenic HA-, CA-, and LA-MRSA in foods illegally entering the EU, and highlights illegal importation of food as route of enterotoxigenic MRSA spread. Uncontrolled entry of food stuffs into the EU can be a relevant neglected route of MRSA dissemination."

Milk consumption decreases with age, but milk consumption during childhood and adolescence increases the chances of lifetime milk consumption. Understanding how parents perceive dairy milk and other dairy foods further enables development of dairy-positive messaging that aligns with their perceptions. The objective of this research was to understand parent belief systems around fluid dairy milk and plant-based alternatives (PBA). This goal was accomplished by assessing parents' implicit attitudes toward dairy milk and PBA with an implicit bias exercise (n = 331), followed by qualitative interviews to understand explicitly stated purchase motivations and guided recall of information heard about dairy milk and PBA to better understand external influences on milk perception (n = 88). The majority of parents (73.4%) implicitly associated dairy milk with positive attributes compared with those with a positive association with PBA (13.8%) or with a neutral bias (12.7%). The stronger a parent's implicit bias toward PBA, the more likely they were to purchase these products either alongside or as a replacement for dairy milk. Eighty-five percent of parents in our study could recall drinking milk at home as a child, and 58% remembered encouragement from their parents to drink milk. However, only 38% encouraged their own children to drink milk (the majority, 55%, were neutral toward their children's milk consumption). Generally negative media messaging toward dairy milk and positive messaging toward PBA may contribute to this trend, even if consumers are not explicitly aware of their perception changes. Seventy-seven percent of parents felt generally confident in choosing dairy milk or PBA for their children. However, only 26% of parents felt that nothing about dairy milk or PBA information or messaging was confusing. Sources of uncertainty about dairy milk included hormones and antibiotics, animal welfare, ecological sustainability, potential contamination, and intolerances or allergies. By addressing the most commonly encountered and recalled concerns about milk from parents, dairy producers may be able to increase trust and implicit bias toward dairy milk compared with PBA."

Macrorestriction analysis of chromosomal DNA from S. aureus isolates was performed using the restriction enzyme SmaI followed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The prevalence rates of nine S. aureus enterotoxin genes (sea, seb, sec, sed, see, seg, seh, sei, and sej) and of the toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 gene (tst) were determined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The bulk tank milks of 14 out of 20 farms were contaminated with S. aureus at levels of up to 6.0x10(3 )CFU/ml. Farm size had no significant effect (P>0.05) on the S. aureus counts in bulk milk. The prevalence rates of penicillin resistance were 88.9% and 20.0% among the S. aureus recovered from mastitic quarter milk and bulk tank milk, respectively. After phenotypic characterization, a total of 59 S. aureus isolates were selected for genotyping. PFGE analysis revealed 22 distinct pulsotypes, including 14 main types and 8 subtypes, at a similarity level of 86%. Only one or two main types were observed on each of the farms tested, indicating a lack of genetic diversity among S. aureus isolates within farms, and there were only two pulsotypes which occurred on more than one farm. The PFGE patterns showed genetic relatedness between the S. aureus strains recovered from quarter milk and bulk milk on two large farms, implying that on farms having a high number of mastitic cows, S. aureus from infected udders may contaminate bulk milk and, subsequently, raw milk products. Sixteen (27.1%) of the S. aureus isolates tested by multiplex PCR were found to be positive for enterotoxin genes, with 15 of them carrying just one gene and one strain carrying two genes (seg and sei). The most commonly detected toxin genes were seb, sea, and sec, whereas none of our isolates possessed the see, seh, sej, or tst genes.

The objective of this study was to assess the microbial quality of water offered to lactating dairy cows and identify risk factors for poor water quality. We further aimed to determine the impact of biofilm formation on water quality and evaluate rapid test systems to score the hygiene status of dairy troughs on the farm. A total of 105 troughs located on 24 typical Western German dairy farms were sampled. Samples of livestock drinking water and biofilm were analyzed for aerobic total viable count (TVC), coliform count (CC), Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and other bacteria resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins (CRB). Surface protein- and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-rapid tests were evaluated to detect biofilm formation. The influence of 22 selected fixed and variable trough characteristics on impaired livestock drinking water quality was evaluated by calculating odds ratios. The average TVC, CC, and E. coli counts were 4.4 ± 0.06 (mean ± SD), 1.7 ± 0.1, and 0.6 ± 0.1 log10 cfu per mL, respectively. CC was detectable in 94.3% of all water samples and E. coli in 48.6%. MRSA was found in pooled livestock drinking water samples of a single farm and CRB on three farms, suggesting that troughs might function as a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, thereby contributing to an exchange of antibiotic-resistant bacteria between animals. Risk factors for the impairment of at least one microbial quality criteria (TVC, CC, or E. coli) increased significantly (P < 0.05) when using high-volume troughs, other trough materials than stainless steel, a lower distance to the milking parlor, heavy visible soiling, biofilm formation, and high ambient and high water temperatures. CC (r = 0.46; P < 0.001) and E. coli (r = 0.31; P < 0.01) of water samples correlated with their equivalent in biofilm and with the results of rapid tests on trough surfaces (0.31 > r > 0.19; P < 0.05).

BoNTs are divided into more than seven toxinotypes based on neutralization with specific corresponding antisera, and each toxinotype is subdivided into subtypes according to amino acid sequence variations. Animal species show variable sensitivity to the different BoNT toxinotypes. Thereby, naturally acquired animal botulism is mainly due to BoNT/C, D and the mosaic variants CD and DC, BoNT/CD being more prevalent in birds and BoNT/DC in cattle, whereas human botulism is more frequently in the types A, B and E, and to a lower extent, F. Botulism is not a contagious disease, since there is no direct transmission from diseased animals or man to a healthy subject. Botulism occurs via the environment, notably from food contaminated with C. botulinum spores and preserved in conditions favorable for C. botulinum growth and toxin production. The high prevalence of botulism types C, D and variants DC and CD in farmed and wild birds, and to a lower extent in cattle, raises the risk of transmission to human beings. However, human botulism is much rarer than animal botulism, and botulism types C and D are exceptional in humans. Only 15 cases or suspected cases of botulism type C and one outbreak of botulism type D have been reported in humans to date. In contrast, animal healthy carriers of C. botulinum group II, such as C. botulinum type E in fish of the northern hemisphere, and C. botulinum B4 in pigs, represent a more prevalent risk of botulism transmission to human subjects. Less common botulism types in animals but at risk of transmission to humans, can sporadically be observed, such as botulism type E in farmed chickens in France (1998-2002), botulism type B in cattle in The Netherlands (1977-1979), botulism types A and B in horses, or botulism type A in dairy cows (Egypt, 1976). In most cases, human and animal botulisms have distinct origins, and cross transmissions between animals and human beings are rather rare, accidental events. But, due to the severity of this disease, human and animal botulism requires a careful surveillance."

Listeriosis presents as flu-like symptoms in healthy individuals, and can be fatal for children, elderly, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals. Estimates suggest that L. monocytogenes results in ∼1,600 illnesses and ∼260 deaths annually in the United States. L. monocytogenes can survive and persist in a variety of harsh environments, including conditions encountered in production of fermented dairy products such as cheese. For instance, microbial growth is often limited in soft cheese fermentation because of harsh pH, water content, and salt concentrations. However, L. monocytogenes has caused a number of deadly listeriosis outbreaks through the contamination of cheese. The purpose of this study was to understand if genetically distinct populations of L. monocytogenes are associated with particular foods, including cheese and dairy. To address this goal, we analyzed the population genetic structure of 504 L. monocytogenes strains isolated from food with publicly available genome assemblies. We identified 10 genetically distinct populations spanning L. monocytogenes lineages 1, II, and III and serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, 1/2c, 4b, and 4c. We observed an overrepresentation of isolates from specific populations with cheese (population 2), fruit/vegetable (population 2), seafood (populations 5, 8 and 9) and meat (population 10). We used the Large Scale Blast Score Ratio pipeline and Roary to identify genes unique to population 1 and population 2 in comparison with all other populations, and screened for the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence genes across all isolates. We identified > 40 genes that were present at high frequency in population 1 and population 2 and absent in most other isolates. Many of these genes encoded for transcription factors, and cell surface anchored proteins. Additionally, we found that the virulence genes aut and ami were entirely or partially deleted in population 2. These results indicate that some L. monocytogenes populations may exhibit associations with particular foods, including cheese, and that gene content may contribute to this pattern."

In this context, a probabilistic model was developed to quantify the concentration of Escherichia coli in raw milk and explore what may happen to France under climate change conditions. It included four modules: initial contamination, packaging, retailing, and consumer refrigeration. The model was built in R using the 2nd order Monte Carlo mc2d package to propagate the uncertainty and analysed its impact independently of the variability. The initial microbial counts were obtained from a dairy farm located in Saudi Arabia to reflect the impact of hot weather conditions. This country was taken as representative of what might happen in Europe and therefore in France in the future due to climate change. A large dataset containing 622 data points was analysed. They were fitted by a Normal probability distribution using the fitdistrplus package. The microbial growth was determined across various scenarios of time and temperature storage reflecting the raw milk supply-chain in France. Existing growth rate data from literature and ComBase were analysed by the Ratkowsky secondary model. Results were interpreted using the nlstools package. The mean E. coli initial concentration in raw milk was estimated to be 1.31 [1.27; 1.35] log CFU/ mL and was found to increase at the end of the supply chain as a function of various time and temperature conditions. The estimations varied from 1.73 [1.42; 2.28] log CFU/mL after 12 h, 2.11 [1.46; 3.22] log CFU/mL after 36 h, and 2.41 [1.69;3.86] log CFU/mL after 60 h of consumer storage. The number of milk packages exceeding the 2-log French hygiene criterion for E. coli increased from 10% [8;12%] to 53% [27;77%] during consumer storage. In addition, the most significant factors contributing to the uncertainty of the model outputs were identified by running a sensitivity analysis. The results showed that the uncertainty around the Ratkowsky model parameters contributed the most to the uncertainty of E. coli concentration estimates. Overall, the model and its outputs provide an insight on the possible microbial raw milk quality in the future in France due to higher temperatures conditions driven by climate change."

The burden of tuberculosis has been largely reduced in developed territories but remains a huge problem worldwide. The significance of nontuberculous mycobacteria is growing considerably, especially in developed regions with higher life expectancy and more therapy-related immunosuppressed individuals. Due to their robustness mycobacteria can contaminate animal products by direct transmission from infected individuals or by environmental contamination during processing. The situation at market level is poorly known. Most studies analyzing commercially available foods are limited to a small or local scale and mainly focused on a particular mycobacterial species. There is a need to investigate if animal products that have passed the established controls to be for sale at main supermarkets could represent a route of contact with any mycobacteria. Thus, our goal was to study the prevalence of mycobacteria in these foods to assess if this could represent a source of human exposure. Five stores from the main supermarket chains in Spain were selected. 138 dairy and 119 meat products were purchased. All were processed using culture and multiplex real-time PCR methods. Additional molecular methods were used to specifically identify any positive result. Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis (2), M. avium subsp. avium (1), and M. fortuitum (1) were isolated from powdered infant formula and ground beef, chicken sausage, and mortadella cold cut, respectively. Mycobacterial DNA (M. avium, M. tuberculosis complex and other nontuberculous mycobacteria) was detected in 15% of dairy products and 2% of meat products. These results show that the prevalence of viable mycobacteria in foods of animal origin obtained at the supermarket was not substantial although a considerable proportion of them contained mycobacterial DNA. Contact with mycobacteria through this route could be ensured over time. Further investigation is necessary to determine the real impact of foodborne mycobacterial exposure on human health and identify critical points in the food production system to enable setting up more stringent control measures."

Amylolytic and cellulolytic enzyme-assisted modifications of oats produce new products that are more appealing to consumers. However, the biochemical and functional alteration of products and extracts requires careful selection of raw materials, enzyme cocktails, and technological aspects. This study compares the biochemical composition of different A. sativa enzyme-assisted water extracts and evaluates their microbial growth using spontaneous fermentation and the antimicrobial properties of the ferment extracts. Fibre content, total phenolic content, and antioxidant activity were evaluated using traditional methodologies. The degradation of A. sativa flour was captured using scanning electron microscopy (SEM); moreover, sugar and oligosaccharide alteration were identified using HPLC and HPLC-SEC after INFOGEST in vitro digestion (IVD). Additionally, taste differentiation was performed using an electronic tongue with principal component analysis. The oat liquid extracts were continuously fermented using two ancient fermentation starters, birch sap and Tibetan kefir grains. Both starters contain lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which has major potential for use in bio-preservation. In fermented extracts, antimicrobial properties against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococci as well as Gram-negative opportunistic bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also determined. SEM images confirmed the successful incorporation of enzymes into the oat flour. The results indicate that using enzyme-assisted extraction significantly increased TPC and antioxidant activity in both the extract and residues. Additionally, carbohydrates with a molecular mass (MM) of over 70,000 kDa were reduced to 7000 kDa and lower after the incorporation of amylolytic and cellulolytic enzymes. The MM impacted the variation in microbial fermentation, which demonstrated favourable antimicrobial properties. The results demonstrated promising applications for developing functional products and components using bioprocessing as an innovative tool."

In response, producers often implement practices beyond those required for regulatory compliance to meet consumer demands. However, environmental stewardship and animal welfare may have conflicting objectives. Examples include pasture-based dairy and beef cattle production where high-fiber diets increase methane emissions compared with grain feeding practices in confinement. Grazing systems can contribute to nitrate contamination of surface and groundwater in some areas of the world where grazing is the predominant land use. Similarly, hoop housing for sows, an alternative to indoor gestation crates, can increase the risk of nutrient leaching into soil and groundwater. Direct air emissions may also increase with unconfined animal production as a result of less opportunity to trap and treat emissions, as well as the result of increased cage space and greater surface area per mass of excreta. Coupling welfare-friendly and organic production practices may require greater nutrient inputs to reach the same production end point, resulting in less efficient nutrient use and greater losses to the environment. Dual systems might additionally increase environmental contamination by pathogens. When swine are housed in welfare-friendly huts, Salmonella may cycle more freely between swine and their environment; however, population numbers of pathogenic bacteria may not be different between the indoor and outdoor systems evaluated. Alternatively, these dual purpose systems may reduce antibiotic and hormonal releases to the environment. Finally, intensity of resource use may be different under welfare-friendly and organic practices. In most situations, welfare-friendly production will require more land area per animal or per unit of product. Energy inputs into such systems, from feed production to rearing to product distribution, may also differ from prevalent industrial production practices. Clearly, consumers and producers considering the benefits and costs of ethical animal production practices need to understand the system-wide environmental impacts of these approaches to meeting demand for animal products."

This is particularly true in the context of water quality regulations, such as Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs), that identify agriculture as one source of non-point source pollution through larger tributary watershed scale and above and below water quality investigations. We have conducted a systems approach study of 10 coastal dairies and ranches to document fecal coliform concentration and loading to surface waters at the management decision unit scale. Water quality samples were collected on a storm event basis from loading units that included: manure management systems; gutters; storm drains; pastures; and corrals and lots. In addition, in-stream samples were collected above and below the dairy facilities and from a control watershed, managed for light grazing and without a dairy facility or human residence and corresponding septic system. Samples were analyzed for fecal coliform concentration by membrane filtration. Instantaneous discharge was measured for each collected sample. Storm runoff was also calculated using the curve number method (SCS, 1985). Results for a representative dairy as well as the entire 10 dairy data set are presented. Fecal coliform concentrations demonstrate high variability both within and between loading units. Fecal coliform concentrations for pastures range from 206 to 2,288,888 cfu/100 ml and for lots from 1,933 to 166,105,000 cfu/100 ml. Mean concentrations for pastures and lots are 121,298 (SE = 62,222) and 3,155,584 (SE = 1,902,713) cfu/100 ml, respectively. Fecal coliform load from units of concentrated animals and manure are significantly more than units such as pastures while storm flow amounts were significantly less. Compared with results from earlier tributary scale studies in the watershed, this systems approach has generated water quality data that is beneficial for management decisions because of its scale and representation of current management activities. These results are facilitating on-farm changes through the cooperative efforts of dairy managers, regulatory agency staff, and sources of technical and financial assistance."

Notably, the consumption of milk and dairy products is considered to be the main route of human exposure to MAP because of its ability to survive during pasteurization and manufacturing processes. The aim of this study was to investigate, through a microbiological challenge test, the survival of MAP during the manufacturing and ripening period of two Italian hard cheeses, Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano, made from raw bovine milk. The challenge test was performed in two different phases: the creaming phase and the manufacturing phase. The creaming phase, which is the first step of cheese production, was reproduced in the laboratory employing raw cow's milk spiked with a MAP reference strain at a final concentration of 5.58 log10 CFU/mL. After the creaming at 18 °C and 27 °C for 12 h, a decrease of 0.80 log10 and 0.77 log10 was observed in partially skimmed milk, respectively. In the second phase, two batches of raw cow's milk (1000 L each) were inoculated with MAP reference and wild strains, respectively. Then, the entire manufacturing process for Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano, both of Protective Designation of Origin (PDO), was reproduced in an experimental cheese factory, starting from a concentration in milk of 5.19 ± 0.01 and 5.28 ± 0.08 log10 CFU/mL of MAP reference and wild strains, respectively. Heating the curd at 53 °C for 20 min did not affect MAP survival, however a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in MAP viability was observed during the moulding phase and after salting in brine, regarding the wild strains and the reference strain, respectively. In addition, a significant decrease was observed during the ripening period, at which time the MAP concentration dropped below the limit of detection from the second and the third month of ripening, for the wild and reference strains, respectively. Taking into account the poor data availability about MAP survival in hard cheeses, this study may improve the knowledge regarding the effect of the cheese manufacturing process on the MAP dynamics, supporting also the safety of traditional raw milk hard cheeses."

From 18 farms, delivering their milk to an alpine dairy plant for the production of smeared semi-hard and hard cheese. one thousand hundred seventy six one thousand hundred seventy six quarter milk (QM) samples of all cows in lactation (n = 294) and representative samples form bulk tank milk (BTM) of all farms were surveyed for coagulase positive (CPS) and coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS). Furthermore, samples from different steps of the cheese manufacturing process were tested for CPS and CNS. As revealed by chemometric-assisted FTIR spectroscopy and molecular subtyping (spa typing and multi locus sequence typing), dairy cattle represent indeed an important, yet underreported, entrance point of S. aureus into the dairy chain. Our data clearly show that certain S. aureus subtypes are present in primary production as well as in the cheese processing at the dairy plant. However, although a considerable diversity of S. aureus subtypes was observed in QM and BTM at the farms, only certain S. aureus subtypes were able to enter and persist in the cheese manufacturing at the dairy plant and could be isolated from cheese until day 14 of ripening. Farm strains belonging to the FTIR cluster B1 and B3, which show genetic characteristics (t2953, ST8, enterotoxin profile: sea/sed/sej) of the recently described S. aureus genotype B, most successfully contaminated the cheese production at the dairy plant.

Therefore, it appears necessary to know and quantify factors affecting soil intake in order to ensure the food safety in outside rearing systems. Thus, soil intake was determined in two Latin square trials with 24 and 12 lactating dairy cows. In Trial 1, the effect of pasture allowance (20 v. 35 kg dry matter (DM) above ground level/cow daily) was studied for two sward types (pure perennial ryegrass v. mixed perennial ryegrass-white clover) in spring. In Trial 2, the effect of pasture allowance (40 v. 65 kg DM above ground level/cow daily) was studied at two supplementation levels (0 or 8 kg DM of a maize silage-based supplement) in autumn. Soil intake was determined by the method based on acid-insoluble ash used as an internal marker. The daily dry soil intake ranged, between treatments, from 0.17 to 0.83 kg per cow in Trial 1 and from 0.15 to 0.85 kg per cow in Trial 2, reaching up to 1.3 kg during some periods. In both trials, soil intake increased with decreasing pasture allowance, by 0.46 and 0.15 kg in Trials 1 and 2, respectively. In Trial 1, this pasture allowance effect was greater on mixed swards than on pure ryegrass swards (0.66 v. 0.26 kg reduction of daily soil intake between medium and low pasture allowance, respectively). In Trial 2, the pasture allowance effect was similar at both supplementation levels. In Trial 2, supplemented cows ate much less soil than unsupplemented cows (0.20 v. 0.75 kg/day, respectively). Differences in soil intake between trials and treatments can be related to grazing conditions, particularly pre-grazing and post-grazing sward height, determining at least in part the time spent grazing close to the ground. A post-grazing sward height lower than 50 mm can be considered as a critical threshold. Finally, a dietary supplement and a low grazing pressure, that is, high pasture allowance increasing post-grazing sward height, would efficiently limit the risk for high level of soil intake, especially when grazing conditions are difficult. Pre-grazing and post-grazing sward heights, as well as faecal crude ash concentration appear to be simple and practical tools for evaluating the risk for critical soil intake in grazing dairy cows."

Based on the calculation of economic values for traits in the dual-purpose Pinzgau breed, milk production and growth traits remain highly important in the breeding goal, but their relative importance should be adapted to new production and economic conditions. The economic importance of functional traits (especially of cow productive lifetime and fertility) was sufficiently high to make the inclusion of these traits into the breeding goal necessary. An increased interest of consumers in animal welfare and quality of dairy farm products should probably lead to the incorporation of health traits (clinical mastitis incidence and somatic cells score) into the breeding goal. However, keeping carcass traits in the breeding goal of the Slovak Pinzgau breed does not seem to be relevant to the long-term market situation."

One of the sources of MRSA emergence is livestock and its products, often raised in poor husbandry conditions. There are limited studies in Nepal to understand the prevalence of MRSA in dairy animals and its antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profile. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Chitwan, one of the major milk-producing districts of Nepal, from February 2018 to September 2019 to estimate the prevalence of MRSA in milk samples and its AMR profile. The collected milk samples (n = 460) were screened using the California Mastitis Test (CMT) and positive samples were subjected to microbiological analysis to isolate and identify S. aureus. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used to identify the presence of the mecA gene and screen for MRSA. In total, 41.5% (191/460) of milk samples were positive in the CMT test. Out of 191 CMT positive milk samples, the biochemical tests showed that the prevalence of S. aureus was 15.2% (29/191). Among the 29 S. aureus isolates, 6.9% (2/29) were identified as MRSA based on the detection of a mecA gene. This indicates that that 1.05% (2/191) of mastitis milk samples had MRSA. The antibiotic sensitivity test showed that 75.9% (22/29) and 48.3% (14/29) S. aureus isolates were found to be sensitive to Cefazolin and Tetracycline respectively (48.3%), whereas 100% of the isolates were resistant to Ampicillin. In total 96.6% (28/29) of S. aureus isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR). This study revealed a high prevalence of S. aureus-mediated subclinical mastitis in dairy herds in Chitwan, Nepal, with a small proportion of it being MRSA carrying a mecA gene. This S. aureus, CoNS, and MRSA contaminated milk poses a public health risk due to the presence of a phenotype that is resistant to very commonly used antibiotics. It is suggested that dairy herds be screened for subclinical mastitis and treatments for the animals be based on antibiotic susceptibility tests to reduce the prevalence of AMR. Furthermore, future studies should focus on the Staphylococcus spp. to explore the antibiotic resistance genes in addition to the mecA gene to ensure public health."

The use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) is emerging as a potential clean label alternative to chemical preservatives. Here, our aim was to characterize the growth potential at three storage temperatures (5, 16, and 25°C) of a panel of molds (four Mucor and nine Penicillium strains) isolated from dairy products, then investigate the susceptibility of the molds toward 12 LAB cultures. Fungal cell growth and morphology in malt extract broth was monitored using oCelloScope at 25°C for 24 h. Mucor plumbeus 01180036 was the fastest growing and Penicillium roqueforti ISI4 (P. roqueforti ISI4) the slowest of the tested molds. On yogurt-agar plates, all molds grew at 5, 16, and 25°C in a temperature-dependent manner with Mucor strains growing faster than Penicillium strains regardless of temperature. The sensitivity toward 12 LAB cultures was tested using high-throughput overlay method and here all the molds except P. roqueforti ISI4 were strongly inhibited. The antifungal action of these LAB was confirmed when spotting mold spores on agar plates containing live cells of the LAB strains. However, if cells were removed from the fermentates, the inhibitory effects decreased markedly. The antifungal effects of volatiles tested in a plate-on-plate system without direct contact between mold and LAB culture media were modest. Some LAB binary combinations improved the antifungal activity against the growth of several molds beyond that of single cultures in yogurt serum. The role of competitive exclusion due to manganese depletion was examined as a possible antifungal mechanism for six Penicillium and two Mucor strains. It was shown that this mechanism was a major inhibition factor for the molds tested apart from the non-inhibited P. roqueforti ISI4 since addition of manganese with increasing concentrations of up to 0.1 mM resulted in partly or fully restored mold growth in yogurt. These findings help to understand the parameters influencing the mold spoilage of dairy products and the interactions between the contaminating strains, substrate, and bioprotective LAB cultures."

Although estrogen-like substances in the environment were blamed for this increase, the possible role of endogenous estrogens from food has not been widely discussed. We are particularly concerned about cows' milk, which contains a considerable quantity of estrogens. When we name cows' milk as one of the important routes of human exposure to estrogens, the general response of Western people is that ""man has been drinking cows' milk for around 2000 years without apparent harm. "" However, the milk that we are now consuming is quite different from that consumed 100 years ago. Unlike their pasture-fed counterparts of 100 years ago, modern dairy cows are usually pregnant and continue to lactate during the latter half of pregnancy, when the concentration of estrogens in blood, and hence in milk, increases. The correlation of incidence and mortality rates with environmental variables in worldwide countries provides useful clues to the etiology of cancer. In this study, we correlated incidence rates for breast, ovarian, and corpus uteri cancers (1993-97 from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents) with food intake (1961-97 from FAOSTAT) in 40 countries. Meat was most closely correlated with the breast cancer incidence (r=0.827), followed by milk (0.817) and cheese (0.751). Stepwise multiple-regression analysis (SMRA) identified meat as the factor contributing most greatly to the incidence of breast cancer ([R]=0.862). Milk was most closely correlated with the incidence of ovarian cancer (r=0.779), followed by animal fats (0.717) and cheese (0.697). SMRA revealed that milk plus cheese make the greatest contribution to the incidence of ovarian cancer ([R]=0.767). Milk was most closely correlated with corpus uteri cancer (r=0.814), followed by cheese (0.787). SMRA revealed that milk plus cheese make the most significant contribution to the incidence of corpus uteri cancer ([R]=0.861). In conclusion, increased consumption of animal-derived food may have adverse effects on the development of hormone-dependent cancers. Among dietary risk factors, we are most concerned with milk and dairy products, because the milk we drink today is produced from pregnant cows, in which estrogen and progesterone levels are markedly elevated."

A commonly reported concern of dairy consumers is the use of antibiotics in dairy animals, even though these drugs are an important tool for promoting animal health and welfare and food safety. The extent to which consumers are aware of antibiotic residue avoidance practices in dairy production is unknown, and it is unclear whether acquisition of such knowledge could affect purchasing behavior and perceptions of dairy farming. The objectives of this study were to assess consumers' perceptions about the quality and production of dairy products in the United States and determine whether educational materials on processes that limit the occurrence of antibiotic residues in milk can change consumers' perceptions of dairy products and purchasing behaviors. We surveyed 804 consumers and assigned them to 1 of 3 interventions: (1) a control arm (reading the content of the Dairy page of the USDA's myplate. gov website); (2) an educational brochure on the processes that prevent antibiotic residues in milk; and (3) a video on the same processes. We found that a majority (86.1%) of participants believe that the quality of dairy products in the United States is high, although many had concerns about the treatment of dairy animals and chemicals (pesticides, antibiotics, hormones) in dairy products. Compared with the control intervention, the brochure was associated with a significant decrease in the level of concern consumers had about chemicals in their milk [-0.20 points on a Likert scale, 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.32 to -0.08] and a significantly increased comfort in purchasing conventional dairy products (odds ratio 2.43, 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.66). The video was associated with even stronger effects: a 0.29-unit decrease in the level of concern about chemicals in milk (95% CI, -0.42 to -0.016) and 2.94 times greater odds of purchasing conventional dairy products (95%, CI 1.92 to 4.49).

These niches contain distinct microbial communities that may be transferred to raw milk, with potentially important food quality and safety implications for milk producers. It is postulated that the extent to which these microorganisms are transferred could be limited by the inclusion of a teat preparation step prior to milking. High-throughput sequencing on a variety of microbial niches on farms was used to study the patterns of microbial movement through the dairy production chain and, in the process, to investigate the impact of seasonal housing and the inclusion/exclusion of a teat preparation regime on the raw milk microbiota from the same herd over two sampling periods, i. e. , indoor and outdoor. Beta diversity and network analyses showed that environmental and milk microbiotas separated depending on whether they were sourced from an indoor or outdoor environment. Within these respective habitats, similarities between the milk microbiota and that of teat swab samples and, to a lesser extent, fecal samples were apparent. Indeed, SourceTracker identified the teat surface as the most significant source of contamination, with herd feces being the next most prevalent source of contamination. In milk from cows grazing outdoors, teat prep significantly increased the numbers of total bacteria present. In summary, sequence-based microbiota analysis identified possible sources of raw milk contamination and highlighted the influence of environment and farm management practices on the raw milk microbiota. The composition of the raw milk microbiota is an important consideration from both a spoilage perspective and a food safety perspective and has implications for milk targeted for direct consumption and for downstream processing. Factors that influence contamination have been examined previously, primarily through the use of culture-based techniques. We describe here the extensive application of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies to study the relationship between the milk production environment and the raw milk microbiota. The results show that the environment in which the herd was kept was the primary driver of the composition of the milk microbiota composition."

We undertook a desk review of literature to identify practices with potential to contribute to emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in India.

Animal disease surveillance is less developed and infrastructure to support delivery of services is inadequate. Several groups are known to offer animal health services. The untrained ""animal health workers"" and para-veterinarians are more popular with farmers as they charge less for consultations (compared to veterinarians who are few and charge more). Over-the-counter access of antibiotics, without prescription, and direct marketing of drugs to farmers are common. Because of this, farmers are able to treat their animals and only consult when cases become non- responsive to treatment. Antibiotics are mostly used in management of mastitis cases. Drug withdrawal periods are rarely observed and occurrence of antibiotic- contaminated milk has been reported. Awareness on AMR is low and antimicrobial stewardship in livestock is yet to be developed. Initiatives such as the National programme for containment of AMR, National Action Plan on AMR, and the National Health policy point to government's commitment in addressing the problem of AMR in the country. Several animal health and drug use practices, with potential to cause AMR, have been described, and their contribution can be discussed further by engaging stakeholders in a ""theory of change"" exercise.

All animals were healthy throughout the study with normal appetite and milk production levels, and with mild-moderate injection-site reactions that diminished by the end of the study. The measured data showed that milk concentrations of the marker residue of tulathromycin were below the limit of detection (LOD = 1.8 ng/ml) 39 days after the second injection. A 2-compartment model with milk as an excretory compartment best described tulathromycin plasma and CP-60,300 milk pharmacokinetic data.

This study was conducted to determine the concentrations of cadmium, lead, iron, zinc, copper, chromium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, selenium and molybdenum in milk and cheese and to evaluate whether the concentrations of these elements correspond to the permissible levels of toxic elements in milk and cheese for Georgia and the EU. In total, 195 milk samples and 25 cheese samples (16 from Imeruli cheese and nine from Sulguni cheese) were collected from nine different villages in the Kvemo Kartli region in Georgia: Chapala, Vanati, Bolnisi, Mtskneti, Sabereti, Ratevani, Khidiskuri, Kazreti, Kvemo Bolnisi. The determination of heavy metal in all samples was carried out by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The research results show that the concentration of these elements in most milk samples is fairly constant for all villages and is less than the permissible levels, except for seven samples from the following villages: Kvemo Bolnisi, Bolnisi, Mitskineti and Ratawani, where the concentration of lead in the milk samples was higher than the permissible limits mentioned in the literature, ranging from 0.027 to 1003 mg L-1. As for copper, its concentration in milk in Sabereti and Vanati villages was above the permissible limits according to the EU limit, ranging from 0.42 to 1.28 mg L-1. For cheese samples, the concentration of cadmium, lead, copper, Co and Ni in the two types of cheese was less than the permissible limit according to the laws of Georgia. Finally, the heavy metal concentrations in Imeruli and Sulguni cheese for manganese (Mn), chromium (Cr), selenium (Se), molybdenum (Mo) zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) were above the permissible limit.

Pasteurized full-fat cow's milk was used for producing traditional and yoba mutandabota, and was inoculated with a cocktail of strains of the pathogens at an inoculum level of 5.5 log cfu/mL. Survival of the pathogens was monitored over a potential consumption time of 24h for traditional mutandabota, and over 24h of fermentation followed by 24h of potential consumption time for yoba mutandabota. In traditional mutandabota (pH3.4 ± 0.1) no viable cells of B. cereus and C. jejuni were detected 3h after inoculation, while L. monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. significantly declined (P<0.05), but could still be detected (<3.5 log inactivation) at the end of the potential consumption time. This indicated that consumption of traditional mutandabota exposes consumers to the risk of food-borne microbial infections. In yoba mutandabota, L. rhamnosus yoba grew from 5.5 ± 0.1 log cfu/mL to 9.1 ± 0.4 log cfu/mL in the presence of pathogens. The pH of yoba mutandabota dropped from 4.2 ± 0.1 to 3.3 ± 0.1 after 24h of fermentation, mainly due to organic acids produced during fermentation. Only Salmonella spp. was able to grow in yoba mutandabota during the first 9h of fermentation, but then decreased in viable plate count.

The aim of the study was to emphasize the risk of contracting tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) by consuming raw milk and dairy products and to describe TBE epidemics in Slovakia for the period 2012-2016. METHODS:The data on epidemics were obtained from the Annual Reports for the period 2012-2016 available on the website of the Public Health Authority of the Slovak Republic. Medical records of patients hospitalized during epidemics were provided by the Department of Infectology and Travel Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Pavol Jozef Šafárik University in Košice, and the Louis Pasteur University Hospital in Košice. RESULTS:During the period 2012-2016, 13 smaller or larger TBE epidemic outbreaks were recorded in the Slovak Republic. The two outbreaks of TBE reported in 2012 were associated with the consumption of raw goat's milk and dairy products. The first case was an outbreak involving 12 infected people in the Lučenec District. The second case was a family outbreak in the Žilina District, where 3 persons out of 4 family members were infected. In 2013, one epidemic was reported involving 5 persons following the consumption of sheep's cheese from a farm in the Prešov District. One outbreak with 11 cases was reported in 2014. The investigation confirmed its association with the consumption of sheep's cheese in a restaurant located in the Ružomberok District. In 2015, 4 epidemics were described related to the consumption of goat's/sheep's milk and cheese (Žilina District, Krupina District, Kysucké Nové Mesto District, Trenčín District). In 2016, there were 5 TBE epidemics related to the consumption of milk and dairy products. The largest TBE epidemic outbreak in the last 5 years occurred in the Košice District. In this outbreak approximately 500 people were exposed, and 44 contracted the disease. Infected persons confirmed consumption of sheep's cheese from a farm. CONCLUSIONS:Consumption of milk and dairy products made only from pasteurized milk, as well as the immunization of humans and animals are the most effective preventive measures against TBE."

The material subjected to testing included 30 cow's milk samples acquired from farms in the central part of Poland. A total of 54 staphylococcal strains were isolated from the samples, of which 42 were classified as coagulase-negative (CoNS) staphylococci belonging to the following species: S. haemolyticus, S. simulans, S. warneri, S. chromogenes, S. hominis, S. sciuri, S. capitis, S. xylosus and S. saprophyticus, while 12 were classified as S. aureus. The study examined the isolates' capacity for biofilm formation and the staphylococcal capacity for slime production and determined the presence of genetic determinants responsible for biofilm formation, i. e. , the icaA, icaD, bap and eno and, additionally, among coagulase-negative staphylococci, i. e. , the aap, bhp, fbe, embP and atlE. Each tested isolate exhibited the capacity for biofilm formation, of which most of them (79.6%) were capable of forming a strong biofilm, while 5.6% formed a moderate biofilm, and 14.8% a weak biofilm. A capacity for slime production was demonstrated in 51.9% isolates. Most of the tested staphylococcal strains (90.7%) had at least one of the tested genes. Nearly half (47.6%) of the CoNS had the eno gene, while for S. aureus, the eno gene was demonstrated in 58.3% isolates.

Nine dairy farms using grass silage (GS), 6 farms using maize silage (MS), and 4 farms using by-products (BP) as the characteristic feed components were chosen for this survey. Fresh milk was sampled once per month from September 2008 to February 2009 at each dairy farm. The percentages of GS, MS, and BP (soybean curd residue or brewer's grain) in the feed were 32.4, 22.1, and 15.1%, respectively. The milk fat, protein, and lactose contents did not differ among the milks from farms with different feeding systems. Fatty acids with chain lengths of less than C16 and saturated fatty acids were present at higher concentrations in the milks from the GS and MS farms than in the milk from the BP farms; conversely, fatty acids with chain lengths greater than C18 and unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), including mono- (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), were present at higher concentrations in the milks from the BP farms than in the milks from the GS farms. No significant differences were detected in milk flavor, evaluated as sweetness, body, texture, aftertaste, and palatability, between the milks from the farms with different feeding systems. The proportion of BP in the cow's diet was positively correlated with the concentrations of fatty acids with chain lengths greater than C18 and with UFA, MUFA, and PUFA. In contrast, the proportion of GS in the diet was positively associated with the levels of milk fat, protein, fatty acids with chain lengths less than C16, and SFA. The MUFA, PUFA, UFA, and fatty acids with chain lengths greater than C18 were not associated with any of the milk flavors. These results suggest the regional differences in feeding systems contribute to the differences in the fatty acid compositions of milk at the farm level. However, these differences do not influence the flavor of pasteurized milk. Thus, more specific feed profiles will be required to provide a specific regional flavor to pasteurized milk."

Overall, 255 bulk-milk and 225 milk filter samples were screened for the presence of Shiga toxin genes (stx1 and stx2), O157 and O26 serogroups by using PCR. The samples were collected in 193 bovine dairy farms located in Northern Italy, including 32 farms selling raw milk to consumers. According to the preliminary PCR screening test, 32 out of 255 (12.5%; CI95%, 8.7% to 17.3%) bulk milk samples and 68 out of 225 (30.2%; CI95%, 24.3% to 36.7%) milk filters were positive for stx genes. Of the 32 milk samples that were stx-positive, 4 (1.6%, CI95%, 0.4% to 4%) were also positive by PCR for the rfbEO157 gene and 6 (2.4%, CI95%, 0.9% to 5.1%) were positive for the wzxO26 gene. The culture detection method, which was based on the immunomagnetic separation, achieved isolation rates of E. coli serogroups O157 and O26 in 25-67% of the milk samples that tested positive by PCR for these serogroups. STEC O26 was detected in one milk filter (1.6%) from a farm that sells raw milk to consumers directly and one sample (1.4%) of bulk milk intended for pasteurization. The presence of STEC O157 was also detected in 2 milk filters (1.7%) from farms that use milk to produce Grana cheese. All the STEC stains O157 and O26 isolated carried the genes eae and espK and genes belonging to the pathogenicity island OI-122 (efa1/2, sen, pagC), which are markers suitable for screening the human virulent EHEC strains. These virulence markers were also detected in the three strains of stx-negative E. coli O157 isolated from two filters and one milk sample. These strains could be therefore EHEC strains that have lost the stx genes (EHEC-derivative strains). Concern arise for the presence of EHEC O26 and E. coli O157 isolates that are suspected to be an EHEC-derivative in the milk filters sampled in farms that are used to sell raw milk to consumers and in other dairy farms."

We sought to provide insight into the dynamics of important endemic infectious diseases in 3 northeastern US dairy herds. Fecal samples from individual cows and various environmental samples from these farms were tested for the presence of major zoonotic pathogens (i. e. , Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Listeria) as well as commensal bacteria Escherichia coli and enterococci. Additionally, the presence of Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis was tested in fecal and serum samples from individual cows. Test results and health and reproductive records were maintained in a database, and fecal, plasma, DNA, and tissue samples were kept in a biobank. All bacteria of interest were detected on these farms and their presence was variable both within and between farms. The prevalence of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes in individual fecal samples within farm A ranged from 0 to 68.2% and 0 to 25.5%, respectively, over a period of 3 yr. Within farm B, continuous fecal shedding of Salmonella spp. was observed with a prevalence ranging from 8 to 88%; Salmonella Cerro was the predominant serotype. Farm C appeared less contaminated with Salmonella and Listeria, although in the summer of 2005, 50 and 19.2% of fecal samples were positive for Listeria and L. monocytogenes, respectively. The high prevalence of E. coli (89 to 100%), Enterococcus (75 to 100%), and Campylobacter (0 to 81%) in feces suggested they were ubiquitous throughout the farm environment. Fecal culture and ELISA results indicated a low prevalence of Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis infection in these farms (0 to 13.6% and 0 to 4.9% for culture-positive and ELISA-positive, respectively), although the occasional presence of high shedders was observed. Results have major implications for food safety and epidemiology by providing a better understanding of infectious disease dynamics on dairy farms. Comprehensive understanding of these infections may lead to better farm management practices and pathogen reduction programs to control and reduce the on-farm contamination of these pathogens and to prevent their further entry into the food-chain."

From May to September 2015, 195 raw milk samples were collected from 195 dairy farms located in Northern China. Among the samples, 67 (34.4%) samples were positive for E. coli. About 67 E. coli strains were isolated from these 67 samples. The prevalence of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) were 9, 6, 4.5, and 1.5%, respectively.

A cross-sectional bacteriological study was conducted from December 2019 to November 2020. This study aimed to isolate, molecularly detect and determine antibiotic susceptibility patterns of Salmonella from raw cows' milk collected from dairy farms and households in Hawassa, Arsi Negele, and Dale districts. A total of 384 raw milk samples were collected using a simple random sampling technique. Standard bacteriological and biochemical tests were used to isolate Salmonella. The positive samples were further confirmed by the molecular test. Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Salmonella. Using bacteriological and biochemical detection tests, Salmonella was isolated from 10.42% (N = 40) of the total sample. However, in molecular detection, only 32 of the 40 isolates were confirmed to be Salmonella using PCR test. The prevalence was 8.54, 12.69, and 10.46% in Hawassa, Dale, and Arsi Negele districts, respectively. Bacteriological prevalence did not vary significantly between the districts (P > 0.05). Likewise, no significant (P > 0.05) variation was observed in the Salmonella isolation rate between households (12.5%) and farms (8.33%) as well as between dry (8.85%) and wet (11.98%) seasons. Based on herd size, the isolation rate of Salmonella was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in large-scale farms (19.51%) than in small (5.1%) or medium (5.6%) scale dairy farms. The result of the antibiotic susceptibility test showed that Salmonella isolates were 100% resistant to ampicillin, while they were 100% sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was demonstrated in all isolates. This study showed that Salmonella is widespread in the raw milk samples and developing MDR, which may be of public health concern in the study area. It is therefore important that dairy farmers and raw milk sellers in the study area take serious measures to avoid contamination of the milk with Salmonella spp. In addition, the active commitment of the animal health departments in the respective districts to sensitizing dairy farmers and the sensible use of antibiotics at the farm level can help to reduce the antibiotic resistance of Salmonella spp."

These guidelines further stated that ruggedness and specificity testing would be performed only after a test passed both the selectivity and sensitivity assessments. Acceptance criteria for determining success were developed using a statistical approach requiring 90% probability of achieving the correct response, within a 95% confidence interval. A minimum detection level of 0.1% bovine meat and bone meal, consistent with the sensitivity of the methods used by the FDA, was required. Selectivity was assessed by testing 60 dairy feed samples that contained no added animal proteins; sensitivity was determined by evaluating 60 samples (per level of fortification) of the same feed that contained 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2% bovine meat and bone meal. The Reveal test passed the selectivity assessment but failed the sensitivity assessment, detecting only samples fortified at the 2% level and then only 17 to 33% of those samples, when read according to the label directions. The FeedChek test passed the sensitivity assessment but failed the selectivity assessment, with rates for false-positive results ranging from 34 to 38%, depending on the user. The sensitivity of the Reveal test was affected by the concentration of trace minerals present in the feed; concentrations toward the high end of the normal range prevented the detection of true positive feed samples containing bovine meat and bone meal. Better sensitivity assessments were obtained when lamb meal was used either alone or in combination with bovine meat and bone meal.

FMD virus is known to spread by direct contact between infected and susceptible animals, by animal products such as meat and milk, by the airborne route, and mechanical transfer on people, wild animals, birds, and by vehicles. During the outbreak of 2001 in the Netherlands, milk from dairy cattle was illegally discharged into the sewerage as a consequence of transport prohibition. This may lead to contaminated discharges of biologically treated and raw sewage in surface water that is given to cattle to drink. The objective of the present study was to assess the probability of infecting dairy cows that were drinking FMD virus contaminated surface water due to illegal discharges of contaminated milk. So, the following data were collected from literature: FMD virus inactivation in aqueous environments, FMD virus concentrations in milk, dilution in sewage water, virus removal by sewage treatment, dilution in surface water, water consumption of cows, size of a herd in a meadow, and dose-response data for ingested FMD virus by cattle. In the case of 1.6 x 10(2) FMD virus per milliliter in milk and discharge of treated sewage in surface water, the probability of infecting a herd of cows was estimated to be 3.3 x 10(-7) to 8.5 x 10(-5), dependent on dilution in the receiving surface water. In the case of discharge of raw sewage, all probabilities of infection were 100 times higher. In the case of little dilution in small rivers, the high level of 8.5 x 10(-3) is reached. For 10(4) times higher FMD virus concentrations in milk, the probabilities of infecting a herd of cows are high in the case of discharge of treated sewage (3.3 x 10(-3) to 5.7 x 10(-1)) and very high in the case of discharge of raw sewage (0.28-1.0). It can be concluded that illegal and uncontrolled discharges of contaminated milk into the sewerage system may lead to high risks to other cattle farms at 6-50 km distance of the location of discharge within one day. This clearly underlines current measures that prohibit such discharges, and also asks for strict control. This risk assessment clearly demonstrated the potential significance of FMD virus transmission via water, and the results will be useful on an international scale, and could also serve as a basis for other FMD risk-assessment models."

Feeding prebiotics and probiotics may improve health and production of calves. Hence, healthy Holstein heifer calves (n = 1,801) from a large California dairy were enrolled at 4 to 12 h of age and remained in this study until weaning at 60 d of age.

Serum total protein at enrollment and body weight at 7, 42, and 56 d of age were measured. Fecal consistency was assessed daily for the entire preweaning period. A subgroup of 200 calves had fecal samples collected at 7, 14, 21, and 42 d for microbial culture and enumeration of Cryptosporidium oocysts by direct fluorescent antibody staining. Synbiotic-treated calves had 19 g increased ADG compared with control calves for overall ADG, from 7 to 56 d. From 42 to 56 d, prebiotic-treated calves had 85 g greater ADG and synbiotic-treated calves had 78 g greater ADG than control calves. There was no difference in duration of the first diarrhea episode, hazard of diarrhea, or odds of pneumonia per calf with treatment. Probiotic-treated calves had 100 times lower fecal shedding of Cryptosporidium oocysts at 14 d and prebiotic-treated calves had fewer Escherichia coli and pathogenic E. coli at 42 d compared with control calves. Although there were no effects on duration of diarrhea or pneumonia incidence, greater ADG in the late preweaning period may reflect treatment effects on enteric pathogens during the rearing process. The decreased shedding of Cryptosporidium should reduce infectious pressure, environmental contamination, and public health risks from Cryptosporidium. Our findings suggest ADG and potential health benefits for calves fed prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics and can help the dairy industry make informed decisions on the use of these products in dairy production."

A total of 255 dairy product samples (175 raw milk and 80 traditionally processed dairy products) were collected from farms and retail markets. Samples were cultured for S. aureus according to standard microbiology techniques, and the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was used to assess antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates to a panel of 12 antimicrobials. Susceptibility to methicillin was determined based on the sensitivity of isolates to cefoxitin, and resistant isolates were investigated for the presence of mecA and mecC genes using PCR. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 43 (24.6%) of milk, 7 (17.5%) of yogurt, and 2 (5%) of cottage cheese. A significantly higher rate of contamination with S. aureus was recorded among milk samples compared to yogurt and cottage cheese (p = 0.019). Out of 52 S. aureus isolates investigated for susceptibility to 12 antimicrobials, 49 (94.2%) of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin and 42 (80.8%) to amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. Twenty (38.5%) of the isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) based on susceptibility to cefoxitin. However, only one of these isolates (5%) was positive for mecA gene, and none of them were positive for the mecC gene. There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the rate of occurrence of MRSA among isolates from different sources. In conclusion, this study demonstrated a significant level of contamination of milk and dairy products with S. aureus and most isolates were multidrug resistant. The occurrence of MRSA in raw milk and dairy products signifies a serious public health threat as the practice of consuming raw dairy products in the study area is widespread. The lack of agreement between phenotypic and genotypic detection of MRSA suggests the need for further study to identify the genetic basis for the observed resistance phenotype."

A sample from a nationwide online panel survey (N = 1,000) found that use of Internet news services (INS) increased attribution of responsibility to the government, whereas social media use positively related to attributions of responsibility to individuals and to the government. Additionally, attribution of responsibility to the government predicted risk perceptions, which, in turn, positively related to behavioral intentions. Regarding mediation effects, use of INS positively and indirectly influenced behavioral intentions when mediated by attribution of responsibility to the government and risk perceptions. Social media had significant indirect effects on behavioral intentions through attribution of responsibility to individuals and attribution of responsibility to the government; through risk perception; and through attribution of responsibility to the government and risk perception. Thus, attribution of responsibility to the government was important to behavioral intentions, and several unique theoretical and practical contributions to health communication research and practice are discussed. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study found that attribution of responsibility to the government was a key mediator between INS or social media and behavioral intentions. Thus, journalists should accurately and sufficiently reveal the causes of and solutions to food safety problems. Also, this study showed that the indirect effect of social media on behavioral intentions was stronger than that of INS. Health communication practitioners and policymakers should pay more attention to the influence of social media when they want to change public perceptions and increase perceived risks to prevent risky behaviors. This approach applies to all public health problems, not only those regarding food safety. Indeed, public health officials and agencies usually have SNS accounts, with which they might directly and actively communicate with the public when food safety is at risk and from which they might launch various public health campaigns."

Apart from their deleterious health effects on humans and animals, they can be secreted unmodified or carried over into the milk of lactating females, thereby posing health risks to suckling babies. Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) is the major and most toxic aflatoxin type after aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). It contaminates human breast milk upon direct ingestion from dairy products or by carry-over from the parent molecule (AFB1), which is hydroxylated in the liver and possibly in the mammary glands by cytochrome oxidase enzymes and then excreted into breast milk as AFM1 during lactation via the mammary alveolar epithelial cells. This puts suckling infants and children fed on this milk at a high risk, especially that their detoxifying activities are still weak at this age essentially due to immature liver as the main organ responsible for the detoxification of xenobiotics. The occurrence of AFM1 at toxic levels in human breast milk and associated health conditions in nursing children is well documented, with developing countries being the most affected. Different studies have demonstrated that contamination of human breast milk with AFM1 represents a real public health issue, which should be promptly and properly addressed to reduce its incidence. To this end, different actions have been suggested, including a wider and proper implementation of regulatory measures, not only for breast milk but also for foods and feeds as the upstream sources for breast milk contamination with AFM1. The promotion of awareness of lactating mothers through the organization of training sessions and mass media disclosures before and after parturition is of a paramount importance for the success of any action. This is especially relevant that there are no possible control measures to ensure compliance of lactating mothers to specific regulatory measures, which can yet be appropriate for the expansion of breast milk banks in industrialized countries and emergence of breast milk sellers. This review attempted to revisit the public health issues raised by mother milk contamination with AFM1, which remains undermined despite the numerous relevant publications highlighting the needs to tackle its incidence as a protective measure for the children physical and mental health."

While the main function of packaging is to contain and protect food, it may also lead to food waste if residues remain in a package after emptying. Such residues could be attributed to wasteful behavior of consumers, but also to properties of packaging (e. g. , geometry, surface tension) and food (e. g. , surface tension, viscosity). In this study, the technical emptiability (ability of packaging to be emptied entirely) of 36 dairy products is analyzed. Firstly, the amount of food residues in packaging after emptying at room and refrigerator temperature was weighed and set in relation to the original filling quantity. Secondly, streamlined life cycle assessments (LCAs) based on the Product Environmental Footprint guidance with a functional unit of ""one kg of consumed dairy product at room or refrigerator temperature in the home of the consumer"" are conducted. Finally, technical emptiability was included in the streamlined LCA and attributed to the primary packaging in order to evaluate its environmental impact. Technical emptiability for both temperatures combined was found to be between 0.25% (±0.11) and 5.79% (±0.43) for the analyzed dairy products. While there were differences in emptiability results of the same product and different temperatures, no significant trend (p = 0.94) between emptiability and temperature could be observed. Liquid yogurt, cream, and buttermilk in beverage cartons and plastic bottles yielded the highest amounts, while milk in beverage cartons and glass bottles yielded the lowest amounts regarding food residues. Looking at global warming potential, poor technical emptiability of cream in a beverage carton leads to even higher environmental impacts than the production and waste management of its packaging. The streamlined LCA results show that food residues can contribute substantially to the footprint of packaging and can have similar or even higher environmental impacts than packaging production and waste management. Yet, emptiability is remarkably under-researched to this day. Future studies should further develop the methods presented in this paper, while LCA analysts should include technical emptiability when assessing the sustainability of packaging, particularly for those containing resource-intensive goods."

The aim of this study was to make an assessment of dietary exposure to polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), also called 'dioxins' and 'dioxin-like PCBs', using long-term household purchase and consumption survey data collected by TNS-Secodip. Weekly purchases of the major dioxins and dl-PCB vector products of these contaminants were collected for 328 single-person households, who participated at TNS-Secodip consumption surveys from 2003 to 2005 and who were single-person households in order to estimate better their consumption. These data were combined with average contamination levels of food products. Weekly gross average exposure was estimated at 10.2 pg toxic equivalent (WHO TEQ) kg(-1) bw week(-1) (95% confidence interval [9.6, 10.9]). According to the typical shape of the distribution of individual weekly exposures, it is sensible to fit an exponential law to these data. The mean was therefore 12.1 pg WHO TEQ kg(-1) bw week(-1). This value is higher than the arithmetic mean because it better takes into account inter-individual variability. It was estimated that about 20% of persons in this sample were exceeding the current health-based guidance value mainly due to high consumption of seafood and/or dairy products. Thanks to long survey duration (3 years) and the weekly recording of food consumption, it was possible to demonstrate the actual seasonality of dietary exposure to dioxins and dl-PCBs with a maximum between March and September; similar seasonality is observable for fish consumption. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were adjusted to the time series and it was demonstrated that the number of times the upper limit of confidence intervals exceeds the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) is about 15 weeks per year on average. Finally, compared with the results obtained from data collected in the short-term surveys (1 week), this study does not suggest that short-term consumption surveys tend to overestimate the long-term exposure."

The link between SFA consumption by man and coronary heart disease is well established. In contrast, ruminant products also contain fatty acids that are known to be beneficial to human health, namely conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs). The aims of research in this field have been to understand the microbial ecology of lipolysis and biohydrogenation and to find ways of manipulating ruminal microbes to increase the flow of PUFA and CLA from the rumen into meat and milk. This review describes our present understanding of the microbial ecology of ruminal lipid metabolism, including some apparently anomalous and paradoxical observations, and the status of how the metabolism may be manipulated and the possible consequential effects on other aspects of ruminal digestion. Intuitively, it may appear that inhibiting the ruminal lipase would cause more dietary PUFA to reach the mammary gland. However, lipolysis releases the non-esterified fatty acids that form the substrates for biohydrogenation, but which can, if they accumulate, inhibit the whole process. Thus, increasing lipase activity could be beneficial if the increased release of non-esterified PUFA inhibited the metabolism of CLA. Rumen ciliate protozoa do not carry out biohydrogenation, yet protozoal lipids are much more highly enriched in CLA than bacterial lipids. How could this happen if protozoa do not metabolise PUFA? The answer seems to lie in the ingestion of plant organelles, particularly chloroplasts, and the partial metabolism of the fatty acids by contaminating bacteria. Bacteria related to Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens are by far the most active and numerous biohydrogenating bacteria isolated from the rumen. But do we misunderstand the role of different bacterial species in biohydrogenation because there are uncultivated species that we need to understand and include in the analysis? Manipulation methods include dietary vegetable and fish oils and plant-derived chemicals. Their usefulness, efficacy and possible effects on fatty acid metabolism and on ruminal microorganisms and other areas of their metabolism are described, and areas of opportunity identified."

Questionnaire data from 113 eligible cases and 506 controls were analysed using multivariate logistic regression. Statistically significant animal and environmental risk factors for human STEC infections were identified, notably 'Cattle livestock present in meshblock' (the smallest geographical unit) (odds ratio 1.89, 95% CI 1.04-3.42), 'Contact with animal manure' (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.12-3.90), and 'Contact with recreational waters' (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.30-6.70).

E. coli O157:H7 caused 100/113 (88.5%) of clinical STEC infections in this study, and 97/100 isolates were available for molecular analysis. PFGE profiles of isolates revealed three distinctive clusters of genotypes, and these were strongly correlated with SBI type. The variable 'Island of residence' (North or South Island of New Zealand) was significantly associated with PFGE genotype (p = 0.012). Our findings implicate environmental and animal contact, but not food, as significant exposure pathways for sporadic STEC infections in humans in New Zealand. Risk factors associated with beef and dairy cattle suggest that ruminants are the most important sources of STEC infection. Notably, outbreaks of STEC infections are rare in New Zealand and this further suggests that food is not a significant exposure pathway."

Spiked goat milk was used to make mature Tronchón cheeses, which were analyzed at 0, 30, and 60 d of maturation to determine pH, chemical composition, proteolytic and lipolytic activities, and color and textural properties. A sensory evaluation of 60-d ripened cheeses was carried out. Cheeses from raw antibiotic-free goat milk were made simultaneously to be used as reference. The cheese-making process was unaffected by the presence of most antibiotics evaluated. Only erythromycin and oxytetracycline significantly increased the time required for cheese production (122 ± 29 and 108 ± 25 min, respectively). However, variable amounts of antibiotics, ranging from 7.4 to 68%, were transferred from milk to cheese, with oxytetracycline and quinolones showing the highest retention rates. In general, antibiotic residues present in the cheeses at the beginning of maturation decrease significantly along time. Thus, β-lactams and erythromycin residues were not detectable after 30 d of ripening. However, relatively high concentrations of enrofloxacin (148 ± 12 µg/kg) and ciprofloxacin (253 ± 24 µg/kg) residues were found in the cheeses after 60 d of maturation. The quality characteristics of the Tronchón cheeses were only slightly affected by such substances, with few significant differences in the free fatty acid concentration and color and textural properties of the cheeses. Results herein indicate that the use of goat milk containing antibiotics, such as quinolones, at the European Union maximum residue limit for cheese production could adversely affect the safety of the final products because relatively high concentrations of these substances could be retained in soft and semi-mature cheeses, making it necessary to assess the risk for consumer health.

In order to help the dairy industry better evaluate biopreservatives for control of fungal spoilage, we developed a challenge study protocol, which was applied to evaluate 2 commercially available protective cultures for their ability to control yeast and mold spoilage of Greek yogurt. Greek yogurt formulated with and without protective cultures was inoculated with a cocktail consisting of 5 yeasts and 1 mold to yield inoculum levels of 101 and 103 cfu/g of yogurt. The inoculated yogurts were stored at 7°C and fungal counts as well as time to visible growth, on the yogurt surface, of mycelium mold colonies or yeast were determined over shelf-life. Whereas fungal concentrations increased to spoilage levels (≥105 cfu/g) in all yogurt formulations at both inoculum levels by d 23 of storage at 7°C, no surface mold was observed over 76 d in any of the products formulated with protective cultures. Control yogurts without biopreservatives all showed surface mold by d 23. In order to allow industry to better evaluate the business effects of improved control of surface mold growth that can be achieved with protective cultures, we developed a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate consumer exposure to visible mold growth in yogurt formulated without fungal inhibitors. Our model showed that initial mold contamination rate has the largest effect on the model outcome, indicating that accurate data on contamination rates are important for use of these models. When air plates were used, in a proof-of-concept approach, to estimate initial contamination rates in a small yogurt manufacturing operation, our model predicted that 550 ± 25.2 consumers (±standard deviation) would be exposed to visible mold growth for every 1 million cups of yogurt produced. With initial contamination rate data for individual facilities, this model could be used by industry to estimate the number of consumers exposed to visible mold spoilage and could allow industry to better assess the value of mold-control strategies."

Isolation from individual goat milk has been documented very rarely, and chronic, asymptomatic intramammary infection by L. monocytogenes with continuous milk shedding of viable bacteria has never been described in this dairy species. At the routine controls, cheese and bulk milk were positive for L. monocytogenes in a herd of 200 lactating Alpine goats, but none showed clinical signs of listeriosis. Individual milk was subjected to bacterial culture and a clinically healthy goat was identified as affected by a chronic intramammary infection (IMI) by L. monocytogenes. The goat had never shown clinical signs of mastitis or other diseases. Her right half-udder milk was positive to L. monocytogenes in two consecutive samples collected one week apart, as demonstrated by bacterial culture and molecular analysis. Mammary tissues collected after culling were also positive to L. monocytogenes by culture. Histological examination highlighted a chronic interstitial mastitis with leukocyte infiltration, atrophy of the alveoli and presence of corpora amylacea. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) confirmed the presence of high numbers of bacteria in the lumen of mammary alveoli, with intracellular bacteria mainly located in macrophages, but also present in neutrophils and epithelial cells. After culling of the positive goat, bulk tank milk tested negative to L. monocytogenes at the following controls. This study demonstrates that L. monocytogenes can establish a chronic, subclinical IMI in goats with high numbers of bacteria shed in milk, representing a source of contamination for the herd and its dairy products. This underscores the importance of frequently monitoring all dairy herds that sell directly milk and/or fresh cheese and indicates that a chronic L. monocytogenes IMI should also be considered as source of bacteria when bulk tank milk contamination is detected in a dairy goat farm."

We present two case studies related to foodborne microbial risks. In the first, we combine models to describe the sequence of events resulting in illness from consumption of milk contaminated with VTEC O157. We used Monte Carlo simulation to propagate uncertainty in some of the inputs to computer models describing the farm and pasteurisation process. Resulting simulated contamination levels were then assigned to consumption events from a dietary survey. Finally we accounted for uncertainty in the dose-response relationship and uncertainty due to limited incidence data to derive uncertainty about yearly incidences of illness in young children. Options for altering the risk were considered by running the model with different hypothetical policy-driven exposure scenarios. In the second case study we illustrate an efficient Bayesian sensitivity analysis for identifying the most important parameters of a complex computer code that simulated VTEC O157 prevalence within a managed dairy herd. This was carried out in 2 stages, first to screen out the unimportant inputs, then to perform a more detailed analysis on the remaining inputs. The method works by building a Bayesian statistical approximation to the computer code using a number of known code input/output pairs (training runs). We estimated that the expected total number of children aged 1.5-4.5 who become ill due to VTEC O157 in milk is 8.6 per year, with 95% uncertainty interval (0,11.5). The most extreme policy we considered was banning on-farm pasteurisation of milk, which reduced the estimate to 6.4 with 95% interval (0,11). In the second case study the effective number of inputs was reduced from 30 to 7 in the screening stage, and just 2 inputs were found to explain 82.8% of the output variance. A combined total of 500 runs of the computer code were used.

{'Fruits': ['Selenium (Se)']}</s>","Selenium (Se) is an essential nutrient for both plants and animals and is usually provided as a supplement to livestock. Se bioaccumulation promotes plant growth by enhancing the accumulation of organic solutes and the activation of antioxidant system. In animals, the Se supplements reduce the chances of mastitis and white muscle disease, and improve the immunity, health, and reproduction, particularly in lactating dairy cows. Therefore, the enrichment or biofortification of fodder crops with Se may improve the nutritional quality of forages and thereby reduce malnutrition in cattle. However, Se hyper-accumulation in plants or plant parts can cause direct toxic effects on insects especially bees. Berseem is a highly cross-pollinated fodder crop that attracts a large number of pollinators. However, little or no reports are available regarding the effects of Se biofortification on the foraging behavior of pollinators in berseem. Therefore, the current study was planned to evaluate the effect of exogenous application of Se on the foraging behavior of native pollinators visiting the berseem crop. Five different doses of Se were applied to evaluate its effect on abundance, foraging behavior (visit duration and visitation rate), and single-visit efficacy of native pollinators that may affect berseem seed yield. Our results showed maximum abundance of pollinators in plants supplemented with low Se level, i. e. , 5 g ha-1 while the minimum abundance was observed at high Se doses (15 and 20 g ha-1). Also, the seed yield attributes, i. e. , the number of seeds per head, seed weight per head, 1000 seed weight, were the highest in plants treated with a low dose of Se, whereas the seed yield of berseem decreased with an increase in Se concentrations. Hence, our study provides evidence that high doses of Se negatively affect the foraging behavior of pollinators (visitation rate and visit duration) in plants. We conclude that the application of moderate Se dose positively influences the pollination ecology of berseem, consequently improving seed yield. HIGHLIGHTS: Selenium (Se) is essential for animals and beneficial for plants and may become toxic at high level. Se is delivered to the environment due to agriculture. Se toxicity affected berseem growth and considerably reduced the seed yield. High dose of Se reduced the abundance of pollinators and negatively affected their foraging behavior."

The disposal of animal wastes on land is a potential nonpoint source of water degradation. Water degradation and human health is a major concern when considering the disposal of large quantities of animal waste. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of animal waste application on biological (fecal coliform, Enterobacter spp. and Escherichia coli) and physical/chemical (temperature, pH, nitrate nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, phosphate, copper, zinc, and sulfate) characteristics of runoff water in experimental plots. The effects of the application of animal waste have been evaluated by utilizing experimental plots and simulated rainfall events. Samples of runoff water were collected and analyzed for fecal coliforms. Fecal coliforms isolated from these samples were identified to the species level. Chemical analysis was performed following standard test protocols. An analysis of temperature, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, iron, copper, phosphate, potassium, sulfate, zinc and bacterial levels was performed following standard test protocols as presented in Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater [1]. In the experimental plots, less time was required in the tilled broiler litter plots for the measured chemicals to decrease below the initial pre-treatment levels. A decrease of over 50% was noted between the first and second rainfall events for sulfate levels. This decrease was seen after only four simulated rainfall events in tilled broiler litter plots whereas broiler litter plots required eight simulated rainfall events to show this same type of reduction. A reverse trend was seen in the broiler litter plots and the tilled broiler plots for potassium. Bacteria numbers present after the simulated rainfall events were above 200/100 ml of sample water. It can be concluded that: 1) non-point source pollution has a significant effect on bacterial and nutrients levels in runoff water and in water resources; 2) land application of animal waste for soil fertilization makes a significant contribution to water pollution; 3) the use of tilling can significantly reduce the amount of nutrients available in runoff water."

Important factors that can affect the results of an assessment of incinerator emissions include (1) the emission and deposition rates of TCDD from the source, (2) the fractional retention and half-life of fly ash on plants, (3) the environmental half-life of TCDD, (4) the animal feeding and management systems, (5) the bioavailability of TCDD and related compounds, (6) the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of TCDD in farm animals, (7) food consumption levels, (8) the half-life of TCDD in humans, and (9) the model selected to estimate cancer risk. For persons living in the area of highest deposition near an incinerator, a possible uptake of TCDD from foods of animal origin was estimated to be about 10-40 fg/kg. d, which was much greater than the 1-5 fg/kg. d uptake estimated for foods of plant origin. The total uptake of TCDD from foods by the maximally exposed population will usually be about 500- to 1000-fold greater than that due to inhalation. Although milk was assumed to be the most important food pathway in several previous assessments that evaluated the hazards of airborne emissions, we determined that the deposition-forage-cattle-beef pathway was the more important route of exposure. The previous assessments appear to have used inappropriate pharmacokinetic models for TCDD and to have overestimated pasture use for dairy cows. The amount of TCDD accumulated in soil from airborne emissions was found to be less important than the amount deposited in forage, a finding that is the opposite of the usual conclusions drawn for other routes of TCDD introduction into agricultural environments. Based on the assumption and parameters used in this assessment, the potential human health risks due to TCDD emissions from incinerators are insignificant compared to other background sources of TCDD. It would be desirable to measure TCDD in soil and crops around existing facilities to better evaluate this assessment, but it is likely that concentrations would be too low to reliably quantitate."

In particular, dairy-farm workers are exposed to high levels of fungal bioaerosols on a daily basis. Associating bioaerosol exposure and health problems is challenging and adequate exposure monitoring is a top priority for aerosol scientists. Using only culture-based tools do not express the overall microbial diversity and underestimate the large spectrum of microbes in bioaerosols and therefore the identification of new airborne etiological agents. The aim of this study was to provide an in-depth characterization of fungal exposure at Eastern Canadian dairy farms using qPCR and next-generation sequencing methods. Concentrations of Penicillium/Aspergillus ranged from 4.6 × 10 6 to 9.4 × 10 6 gene copies/m 3 and from 1 × 10 4 gene copies/m 3 to 4.8 × 10 5 gene copies/m 3 for Aspergillus fumigatus. Differences in the diversity profiles of the five dairy farms support the idea that the novel approach identifies a large number of fungal taxa. These variations may be explained by the presence of different and multiple sources of fungal bioaerosols at dairy farms. The presence of a diverse portrait of fungi in air may represent a health risk for workers who are exposed on a daily basis. In some cases, the allergen/infective activity of the fungi may not be known and can increase the risks to workers. The broad spectrum of fungi detected in this study includes many known pathogens and proves that adequate monitoring of bioaerosol exposure is necessary to evaluate and minimize risks. While bioaerosols are a major concern for public health, accurately assessing human exposure is challenging. Highly contaminated environments, such as agricultural facilities, contain a broad diversity of aerosolized fungi that may impact human health. Effective bioaerosol monitoring is increasingly recognized as a strategic approach for achieving occupational exposure description. Workers exposure to diverse fungal communities is certain, as fungi are ubiquitous in the environments and the presence of potential sources increase their presence in the air. Applying new molecular approaches to describe occupational exposure is a necessary work around the traditional culture approaches and the biases they introduce to such studies. The importance of the newly developed approach can help to prevent worker’s health problems."

This study was performed on food samples obtained in a straightforward way while visiting food preparation and distribution centers in Babol. Tests related to different food types were performed by laboratory experts. Data collection with a checklist: date and place of sampling, number of samples, type of food, type of test, compliance of results with standards. Data were analyzed by SPSS22 and descriptive statistics, Chi-square and t-test. 1043 food samples were tested from 5 groups of dairy products, protein, cereals, vegetables and other food groups. The highest number of samples in the cereal group was 767 samples (73.53%). In the cereal group, most samples were breads. The pH of 11.67% of breads and the salt in 21.49% of breads did not match the standard. The blankit (sodium hydrosulfite) on bread dough were negative. Moisture, gluten, ash and pH match with the standards in all flour samples. The results of microbial tests on sweets and ice cream showed that Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella were negative. Enterobacter aerogenes was positive in 8.20% of sweets, mold and yeast were positive in 19.58%. The results of microbial tests on buttermilk and yogurt, grilled meat and chicken sandwiches, vegetables and salads showed that bacteria Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus and all microorganisms were negative. Mold tests were positive in 11.12% of juice samples. The results showed that the foods and drinks supplied in food and drink preparation and distribution centers in Babol in 2019 were of good chemical and microbial quality. In some food groups the results of microbial and chemical testings were negative, i. e. without contamination. Less than 20% of products in the group of cereals and protein products did not match with the standards, which is a satisfactory result compared to other studies conducted in different cities of Iran. These good results for food quality can be explained bythe constructive performance of food health experts that made good controling, monitoring, and food health and hygiene education."

One hundred thirty-eight samples were (33.4%) contaminated with S. aureus. A total of 138 S. aureus strains were isolated and identified. Enterotoksin profiles were determined by Staphylococcal Enterotoxin Test Reversed Passive Latex Agglutination. Their resistance to nine antibiotics were tested. The contamination rate of the meat product samples (48.7%) was significantly higher than milk and dairy products (23.2%). Most of the strains (60.1%) produced staphylococcal enterotoxins. Four strains produced staphylococcal enterotoxin C and staphylococcal enterotoxin D. All of the strains tested were resistant to many of the nine antibiotics. One strain isolated from feta cheese was resistant to all of the antibiotics tested. Penicillin G resistance was the highest (92.7%) among the antibiotics. Seventy-one strains choosen randomly were compared by the DNA macrorestriction patterns obtained from pulsed field gel electrophoresis following Sma I digestion and 33 pulsotypes were determined. Seventy-three strains were characterized by automated ribotyping using Eco RI and 8 ribotypes were determined. The same, as well as different pulsotypes, were identified among strains with the identical ribotyping profile. The presence of enterotoxigenic and antimicrobial resistant strains of S. aureus has become remarkably wide spread in the foods examined and poor sanitary conditions during processing may create a health risk for the consumers. The results of genotyping showed high diversity among the strains. These results suggests that the contamination of various food samples by Staphylococcus aureus indicates poor personel hygiene and/or cross contamination in Turkey. Potential of S. aureus strains to produce enteroxins represent a health hazard to the consumers. Prevalence of multiple resistance to the antibiotics of the strains suggests the restricted use of them in animal and human therapy and growth promotion in animals. Genotyping with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed more subtypes of S. aureus strains isolated from different food sources than automated ribotyping. Therefore, although both methods could be applied to demonsrate the source and route of the contamination, PFGE should be preferred in future studies of epidemiology of the S. aureus contamination."

Although cryptosporidiosis has been reported from human patients in Uruguay, particularly children, epidemiologic information is scant and the role of cattle as reservoirs of zoonotic subtypes of C. parvum has not been explored. In this study, we aimed to (a)-identify C. parvum subtypes infecting dairy calves in Uruguay (including potentially zoonotic subtypes), (b)-assess their association with calf diarrhea, (c)-evaluate their spatial clustering, and (d)-assess the distance of infected calves to surface watercourses draining the farmlands and determine whether these watercourses flow into public water treatment plants. Feces of 255 calves that had tested positive for Cryptosporidium spp. by antigen ELISA were selected. Samples had been collected from 29 dairy farms in seven Uruguayan departments where dairy farming is concentrated and represented 170 diarrheic and 85 non-diarrheic calves. Selected samples were processed by nested PCRs targeting the 18S rRNA and gp60 genes followed by sequencing to identify C. parvum subtypes. Of seven C. parvum subtypes detected in 166 calves, five (identified in 143 calves on 28/29 farms) had been identified in humans elsewhere and have zoonotic potential. Subtype IIaA15G2R1 was the most frequent (53.6%; 89/166), followed by IIaA20G1R1 (24.1%; 40/166), IIaA22G1R1 (11.4%; 19/166), IIaA23G1R1 (3.6%; 6/166), IIaA17G2R1 (3%; 5/166), IIaA21G1R1 (2.4%; 4/166), and IIaA16G1R1 (1.8%; 3/166). There were no significant differences in the proportions of diarrheic and non-diarrheic calves infected with any of the C. parvum subtypes. Two spatial clusters were detected, one of which overlapped with Uruguay's capital city and its main water treatment plant (Aguas Corrientes), harvesting surface water to supply ~1,700,000 people. Infected calves on all farms were within 20-900 m of a natural surface watercourse draining the farmland, 10 of which flowed into six water treatment plants located 9-108 km downstream.

In this study the occurrence of L. monocytogenes in food from four major food groups, dairy products, meats, seafood and vegetables, and associated food processing environments in Ireland was studied over a three-year period. Fifty-four small food businesses participated in the study and sent both food and environmental samples every 2months between 2013 and 2015. L. monocytogenes was isolated using the ISO11290 standard method. Confirmation of L. monocytogenes and identification of serogroups were achieved using a multiplex PCR assay, and for some isolates serotype was determined using commercial antisera. Pulsed- field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis was performed on all isolates allowing the relatedness of isolates from different food businesses to be compared nationwide. In total, 86 distinct pulsotypes were identified. The overall occurrence of L. monocytogenes in food samples was 4.2%, while in environmental samples it was 3.8%. In general, the occurrence of L. monocytogenes in food businesses decreased over the course of the study, presumably reflecting increased awareness and vigilance. The majority of the pulsotypes detected were unique to a particular food group (63/86), while only three pulsotypes were found in all four food groups investigated. The highest occurrence in food was found in the meat category (7.5%) while seafood had the lowest rate of occurrence (1.8%). Seventeen of the pulsotypes detected in the study were persistent, where persistence was defined as repeated isolation from a single facility with a minimum time interval of 6months. Using PFGE, 11 of the pulsotypes identified in this study were indistinguishable from those of 11 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Ireland over the last 4years, highlighting the fact that these pulsotypes are capable of causing disease. Overall, the study shows the diversity of L. monocytogenes strains in the Irish food chain and highlights the ability of many of these strains to persist in food processing environments. The finding that a significant proportion of these pulsotypes are also found in clinical settings highlights the need for continued vigilance by food producers, including frequent sampling and typing of isolates detected."

Another aim of this study was to determine the content of essential and toxic metals in feed and milk of dairy cows on selected farms in Slovakia referred to the suitability of the use of milk from these areas to other food processing. This article deals with the analysis of the content of selected elements in feed and milk of dairy cows in the area of Novoť (Northern Slovakia; area with undisturbed environment) and Čečejovce (Eastern Slovakia; highly disturbed environment). Eleven elements have been analyzed (essential elements: calcium, zinc, magnesium, selenium, iron, copper; toxic elements: arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead, nickel). Samples of feed and milk were collected five times during the spring season and five times during the autumn season in 2016. Analysis of samples was performed in Eurofins Bel/Novamann (Nové Zámky, Slovak Republic). Analyses were performed by atomic absorption spectroscopy and atomic emission spectrometry. The obtained values of the individual elements in the feed and milk were evaluated by Student's t test. Significantly higher contents of essential elements Ca, Zn, Fe, Mg, and Cu were found in the feed of dairy cows in Čečejovce (P < 0.001). Significantly higher (P < 0.001) As and Ni content in feed in Čečejovce in autumn season was also recorded. However, the content of these elements in feed did not affect their milk content. The content of Ca, Zn, and Mg in milk was significantly (P < 0.001) higher in Novoť in both investigated seasons. Some essential elements and toxic elements in feed and milk were below the LOQ (limit of quantification). Reduced content of Ca and Zn in milk in both farms compared with optimal limits, decreased Ca and Mg content in feed in Novoť, and a significant increase of Ca and Mg in feed in Čečejovce in autumn season were found. It can be concluded, due to the low content of toxic elements on these farms, that the use of milk of dairy cows from these areas for direct use or for dairy product processing is appropriate and poses no health risk to the consumers."

Antibiotic residues, antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) can be found in dairy manure and may contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance (AR). Although β-lactam residues are rarely detected in dairy manure, tetracycline residues are common and perhaps persistent. Generally, <15% of bacterial pathogen dairy manure isolates are ARB, although resistance to some antibiotics (e. g. , tetracycline) can be higher. Based on available data, the prevalence of medically important ARB on dairy operations is generally static or may be declining for antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus spp. Over 60 ARG can be found in dairy manure (including β-lactam and tetracycline resistance genes), although correlations with antibiotic usage, residues, and ARB have been inconsistent, possibly because of sampling and analytical limitations. Manure treatment systems have not been specifically designed to mitigate AR, though certain treatments have some capacity to do so. Generally, well-managed aerobic compost treatments reaching higher peak temperatures (>60°C) are more effective at mitigating antibiotic residues than static stockpiles, although this depends on the antibiotic residue and their interactions. Similarly, thermophilic anaerobic digesters operating under steady-state conditions may be more effective at mitigating antibiotic residues than mesophilic or irregularly operated digesters or anaerobic lagoons. The number of ARB may decline during composting and digestion or be enriched as the bacterial communities in these systems shift, affecting relative ARG abundance or acquire ARG during treatment. Antibiotic resistance genes often persist through these systems, although optimal management and higher operating temperature may facilitate their mitigation. Less is known about other manure treatments, although separation technologies may be unique in their ability to partition antibiotic residues based on sorption and solubility properties. Needed areas of study include determining natural levels of AR in dairy systems, standardizing and optimizing analytical techniques, and more studies of operating on-farm systems, so that treatment system performance and actual human health risks associated with levels of antibiotic residues, ARB, and ARG found in dairy manure can be accurately assessed."

This cross-sectional study of gram-negative staining bacterial contamination of milk meant for human consumption was carried out from October 2010 to May 2011 in Gondar town, Ethiopia. Milk samples were collected from critical control points, from production to consumption, that were hypothesized to be a source of potential contamination. Milk sampling points included smallholder's milk producers, dairy co-operatives, a milk processing plant, and supermarkets. The hygienic procedures applied during milking, milk collection, transportation, pasteurization, and postpasteurization storage conditions at these specified critical control points were evaluated. Standard bacteriological cultivation and biochemical assays were used to isolate and identify bacterial pathogens in the milk samples. The results of the current study showed that conditions for contamination of raw milk at different critical points were due to less hygienic practices in pre-milking udder preparation, sub-optimal hygiene of milk handlers, and poor sanitation practices associated with milking and storage equipments. Among all critical control points considered, transportation containers at milk collection centers and at processing plants were found to be the most heavily contaminated with gram-negative staining bacterial species. Overall, 54 different bacterial species were indentified, and Escherichia coli (29.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.5%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.7%), were the most commonly identified gram-negative staining bacterial pathogens. Of particular interest was that no gram-negative staining bacteria were isolated from pasteurized milk samples with varying shelf life. This study showed the presence of diverse pathogenic gram-negative staining bacterial species in raw milk that may be attributed to the sub-optimal sanitary conditions in the production and processing of milk in the Gondar town region. These results highlighted the need to maintain appropriate sanitary and hygienic measures at each critical point in order to safeguard consumers from foodborne pathogens.

Studies correlating gelatinase production with maintenance and subculture of the isolates in the Laboratory environment, and growth in different media were performed. These studies were conducted with two dairy isolates identified as E. faecalis and E. durans, and one clinical isolate, E. faecalis OG1-10. RT-PCR was used for detection of transcripts of the above mentioned genes. Results demonstrated that the virulence factor gelatinase is disseminated among the genus Enterococcus and that dairy isolates are capable of producing gelatinase at comparable levels with clinical isolates, although this capacity is easily lost during conservation by freezing in the laboratory. Therefore, gelatinase production potential of dairy enterococci may be underestimated. The gene gelE was present in all studied isolates. The same was observed for the fsr operon, either complete or incomplete, revealing that the gelatinase genetic determinants, so far only described in E. faecalis, are a common trait in the genus. This work describes for the first time the detection of the complete Fsr-GelE operon in other species than E. faecalis, namely E. faecium and E. durans. The loss of expression of this virulence factor under laboratory culture conditions correlated with the loss of one or more genes of the regulatory fsr operon, although the gene gelE was maintained, demonstrating that a complete fsr operon is required for a positive GelE phenotype. Independent of the detection of any gelatinase activity, if both gelE and the complete fsr operon are present in the cell, all genes are transcribed, as revealed by RT-PCR, suggesting that regulation of gelatinase activity can also be post-transcriptional. The silent behavior of gelE was only observed in E. faecalis, but not in E. durans, suggesting different modulation mechanisms of gelatinase activity in these two species. Overall, these findings reopen the issue of food safety of enterococci and reinforce the need to further study the mechanisms responsible for triggering the virulence factor gelatinase in non-pathogenic enterococcal environmental isolates."

Twenty-four dairy farms were visited twice and samples taken of all diet ingredients. Feed intake data were collected by means of questionnaires. A total of 169 feed samples were collected and analyzed for 20 mycotoxins using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry multimethod. Silage and compound feed were the main diet ingredients, representing on average 67 and 23% of dry matter intake, respectively. Deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone, roquefortine C, and mycophenolic acid were the mycotoxins with the highest incidence. The incidence of DON in silage, compound feed, and feed commodity samples was 38 to 54%. The incidence of zearalenone in silage, compound feed, and feed commodity samples was 17 to 38%. The DON and zearalenone had a low incidence in forage samples and were not detected in ensiled by-product samples. Roquefortine C and mycophenolic acid were only detected in silage and ensiled by-product samples (incidence 7 to 19%). Fumonisins B(1) and B(2) were detected in 2 compound feed samples and one feed commodity sample. Aflatoxins B(1), B(2), G(1), and G(2), ochratoxin A, T-2 and HT-2 toxin, 3-acetyl-DON, 15-acetyl-DON, diacetoxyscirpenol, sterigmatocystin, fusarenon-X, ergotamine, and penicillinic acid were not detected in any of the samples. Average concentrations of DON, zearalenone, roquefortine C, and mycophenolic acid in complete diets were 273, 28, 114, and 54 microg/kg, respectively. Maximum concentrations were 969, 203, 2,211, and 1,840 microg/kg, respectively. Calculated average daily intakes of these mycotoxins were 5.0, 0.5, 2.0, and 0.9 mg/animal, respectively, and maximum daily intakes 19.3, 3.5, 38.9, and 32.3 mg/animal, respectively. Corn silage was the major source of all 4 of these mycotoxins in the diet. Extremely high concentrations of roquefortine C and mycophenolic acid (up to 45 and 25 mg/kg, respectively) were detected in visibly molded areas in surface layers of corn silage. These areas appeared to be the main source of roquefortine C and mycophenolic acid in the diet. Because carry-over of DON, zearale-none, roquefortine C, and mycophenolic acid into milk is negligible, their occurrence in feedstuffs is not considered of significant concern with respect to the safety of dairy products for consumers.

In general, these are global problems but the magnitudes differ. Pathogens involved include those of the genera Salmonellae, Escherichia, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Listeria, and Staphylococci. Infections follow consumption of contaminated foods or animal to human and human to human transmissions. Contaminated dairy products are among the top sources of food-borne infections. Most such infections come from unpasteurized dairy products, but pasteurized products are sometimes implicated. These occur because of either faulty pasteurization or due to post-pasteurization contaminations. Many factors hamper control of such infectious pathogens, including lack of vaccines, the presence of asymptomatic healthy carriers, existence of broad host range pathogens (with the hosts serving as reservoirs), resistance of pathogens to ordinary disinfectants, the long contamination-prone processes from production to consumption and increased frequency of resistance of pathogens to antibiotics. The antibiotic resistance property is hazardous in itself (whether with or without the contaminants being pathogenic) considering the potential for interspecies transfer of these resistance traits (be they chromosomal or plasmid-borne) to commensal or pathogenic bacteria in clinical settings and/or in the food chain. In low income countries, the problems are further compounded by the limited capacity for accurate diagnosis, overlap of symptoms, and the resulting (hit-or-miss) empirical treatment. Here, samples of dairy products were purchased from Addis Ababa supermarkets. The samples were subjected to enrichment and selective cultures to test the presence of and isolate gram-negative bacteria. The isolates were characterized by biochemical and molecular methods. All milk samples harboured gram-negative bacilli, which are likely to constitute hazard to public health. Moreover, all of the isolates exhibited intermediate-level or higher resistance to two or more clinically relevant antibiotics. Sequence alignment showed the isolates to be most closely related to Salmonella enterica. This work found high level of contamination in all sampled milk. The reason(s) for this burden of contamination (either ineffective pasteurization or post-pasteurization contamination) need to be elucidated for meaningful targeted control."

Herds were selected based on size and use of milking technology, and farms were visited once during the study. All mammary glands of all lactating cows were screened using the California Mastitis Test (CMT) and a strip cup. A single aseptic milk sample (20 mL) was collected from all CMT-positive quarters. Identification of Staphylococcus spp. was performed using conventional microbiology, and PCR was used to determine the presence of enterotoxin-encoding genes (sea, seb, sec, and sed). Of the 1,318 CMT-positive milk samples, Staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 263 (19.9%). Of these isolates, 135 (51%) were coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) and 128 (49%) were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). Eighteen different species of CNS were isolated, among which S. warneri, S. epidermidis and S. hyicus were the most frequent. The distribution of Staphylococcus species was different among herds: S. epidermidis was found in 8 herds, S. warneri was found in 7 herds, and S. hyicus in 6 herds. Some of the CNS species (S. saprophyticus ssp. saprophyticus, S. auricularis, S. capitis, and S. chromogenes) were isolated in only one of the farms. Genes related to production of enterotoxins were found in 66% (n=85) of all CNS and in 35% of the CPS isolates. For both CNS and CPS isolates, the most frequently identified enterotoxin genes were sea, seb, and sec; the prevalence of sea differed between CPS (9.5%) and CNS (35.1%) isolates. Staphylococcus warneri isolates showed a greater percentage of sea than seb, sec, or sed, whereas S. hyicus isolates showed a greater percentage of sea than sec. Over 60% of CNS belonged to 3 major species, which carried 62.2 to 81.3% of the enterotoxin genes. The high prevalence highlights the potential for food poisoning caused by these species. For possible high-risk situations for food poisoning, such as milk produced with total bacterial counts greater than regulatory levels and stored under inappropriate temperatures, monitoring contamination with CNS could be important to protect human health. Because the prevalence of CNS intramammary infections in dairy herds is usually high, and these species can be found in great numbers in bulk milk, identification of risk factors for production of staphylococcal enterotoxins should be considered in future studies."

While risk estimates vary, associations are reported with all-cause mortality, colorectal and other carcinomas, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and possibly other inflammatory processes. There are many proposed explanations for these associations, some long discussed in the literature. Attempts to explain the effects of red meat consumption have invoked various red meat-associated agents, including saturated fat, high salt intake, Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) generation by microbiota, and environmental pollutants contaminating red meat, none of which are specific for red meat. Even the frequently mentioned polycyclic aromatic carcinogens arising from high temperature cooking methods are not red meat specific, as these are also generated by grilling poultry or fish, as well as by other forms of cooking. The traditional explanations that appear to be more red meat specific invoke the impact of N-nitroso compounds, heme iron, and the potential of heme to catalyze endogenous nitrosation. However, heme can be denatured by cooking, high levels of plasma hemopexin will block its tissue delivery, and much higher amounts of heme likely originate from red blood cell breakdown in vivo. Therefore, red meat-derived heme could only contribute to colorectal carcinoma risk, via direct local effects. Also, none of these mechanisms explain the apparent human propensity i. e. , other carnivores have not been reported at high risk for all these diseases. A more recently proposed hypothesis involves infectious agents in beef from specific dairy cattle as agents of colorectal cancer. We have also described another mechanistic explanation for the human propensity for risk of red-meat associated diseases that is consistent with most observations: metabolic incorporation of a non-human sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) into the tissues of red meat consumers and the subsequent interaction with inflammation-provoking antibodies against this ""xenoautoantigen"". Overall, we conclude that while multiple mechanisms are likely operative, many proposed theories to date are not specific for red meat, and that the viral and xenoautoantigen theories deserve further consideration. Importantly, there are potential non-toxic dietary antidotes, if the xenoautoantigen theory is indeed correct."

Essential oils (EOs) have shown activities against various bacterial pathogens. However, EOs are water-insoluble and have unpleasant sensory properties, and strategies are needed to prepare colloidal systems for dispersion in liquid products and increase their antimicrobial activity and therefore reduce their usage level. In the present study, the overall objective was to fabricate and characterize self-emulsified nanoemulsions containing multiple EOs with synergistic antibacterial activities. Cinnamon, lemongrass, oregano, and tea tree EOs were observed to have synergistic antibacterial activities when used in combinations, especially for their triple combinations showing the fractional inhibitory concentration index of 0.625 and below. When triple EOs were emulsified by the combination of sunflower lecithin and Tween 20, mixing EOs with corn oil enabled the preparation of translucent oil-in-water nanoemulsions by simply stirring the mixtures. Three formulations were chosen for the preparation of self-emulsified nanoemulsions as these systems remained translucent, the droplet diameter remained to be smaller than 200 nm, and the polydispersity index remained to be smaller than 0.3 after 180-day ambient storage at 21 °C. The oil: surfactant mass ratio in these nanoemulsions (1.16 or higher) was higher than that of EO microemulsions (up to 0.77) prepared with a similar method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the nanoemulsions remained to be 0.5 or 1.0 mg/mL against S. aureus, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) remained to be 1.0 or 2.0 mg/mL after the 180-day storage. A higher EO: surfactant mass ratio of nanoemulsions resulted in a lower MIC and MBC. When tested in whole milk with 3.3% fat at 21 °C, no inhibition of S. aureus was observed for nanoemulsions at overall EO levels of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/mL; at an overall EO concentration of 7.5 mg/mL, no inhibition was observed for one nanoemulsion with the lowest EO:(corn oil + surfactant) mass ratio, while the gradual reduction of S. aureus by ~1 or 2 log CFU/mL in 120 h was observed for the other two nanoemulsions. The formulations and nanoemulsion preparation method in the present study may be significant to the utilization of EOs as natural preservatives to improve food safety."

This experiment used a combination of a wet chemical method with Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System, in situ nylon bag technique, and three-step in vitro method to compare the chemical composition, carbohydrate and protein composition, in situ ruminal degradability and intestinal digestibility of industrial hemp byproducts and conventional feeds (alfalfa hay, AH; soybean meal, SBM). Available energy values were estimated based on the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The results showed that the nutritional composition of different feeds varied greatly. The two types of IHEEB were enriched with ash, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and calcium, while the contents of neutral detergent insoluble crude protein, acid detergent insoluble crude protein, and acid detergent lignin were higher. As a result, the non-degradable carbohydrate and protein components were higher, and the effective degradation rate of rumen dry matter and protein was lower. IHS contains higher non-protein nitrogen and NDF, which enables it to provide more CP rumen effective degradation rate and carbohydrates, but the high acid detergent fiber also limits its application. IHSM possesses 296 g/kg CP and high rumen undegradable protein and intestinal digested protein, which can provide rumen bypass protein in dairy cows, making it a potentially good protein source. IHOFR had higher ether extract, rumen available protein degradation rate, and total tract digested protein, which can provide more energy and easily degradable protein for lactating cows. The available energy value of IHEEB and IHS was lower than AH, while SBM is between IHFOR and IHSM. In addition, the tetrahydrocannabinol of three industrial hemp byproducts that have not been assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was tested to evaluate their safety, and all of them were less than the limit set by ESFA.

The confluence of these emissions that traditionally have been separated by hundreds of kilometers is creating new air quality challenges in numerous regions across the United States. An area of particular interest is California's San Joaquin Valley (SJV), which has an agricultural output higher than many countries, a rapidly expanding human population, and ozone concentrations that are already higher than many dense urban areas. New regulations in the SJV restrict emissions of reactive organic gases (ROGs) from animal sources in an attempt to meet Federal and State ozone standards designed to protect human health. The objective of this work is to directly measure the ozone formation potential (OFP) of agricultural animal plus waste sources in representative urban and rural atmospheres using a transportable ""smog"" chamber. Four animal types were examined: beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, and poultry. Emissions from each animal plus waste type were captured in a 1 m(3) Teflon bag, mixed with representative background NO(x) and ROG concentrations, and then exposed to UV radiation so that ozone formation could be quantified. The emitted ROG composition was also measured so that the theoretical incremental reactivity could be calculated for a variety of atmospheres and directly compared with the measured OFP under the experimental conditions. The results demonstrate that OFP associated with waste ROG emissions from swine (0.39 +/- 0.04 g-O(3) per g-ROG), beef cattle (0.51 +/- 0.10 g-O(3) per g-ROG), and dairy cattle (0.42 +/- 0.07 g-O(3) per g-ROG) are lower than OFP associated with ROG emissions from gasoline powered light-duty vehicles (LDV) (0.69 +/- 0.05 g-O(3) per g-ROG). The OFP of ROG emitted from poultry waste (1.35 +/- 0.73 g-O(3) per g-ROG) is approximately double the LDV OFP. The measured composition of ROG emitted from animal plus waste sources is nine times less reactive than the current regulatory profiles that are based on dated measurements. The new animal waste ROG OFP measurements combined with adjusted animal waste ROG emissions inventory estimates predict that actual ozone production in the SJV from livestock and poultry (5.7 +/- 1.3 tons O(3) day(-1)) is 40 +/- 10% of the ozone produced by light duty gasoline vehicles (14.3 +/- 1.4 tons O(3) day(-1)) under constant NO(x) conditions."

The higher levels of cross contamination of raw ice cream mix might result in random heat-injured cells when exposed to minimum heat treatment (69°C for 30 min). These heat-injured cells could later recover under abusive storage and handling conditions and pose a health risk. Evidence about the presence of injured cells in ice cream mix may thus prove useful to establish the overall Listeria risk, which was the aim of this study. Challenge studies were conducted to evaluate the dose-dependent presence of heat-injured cells of Listeria. Ice cream mix formulations of 4 different types (36, 40, 42, and 45% total solids) were inoculated at 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 log cfu/g levels of Listeria innocua (an established surrogate). The dose levels were selected based on a likely cross contamination on the raw side from environmental Listeria, especially due to their resident nature and growth in harborage sites. The samples were exposed to minimum heat treatment (69°C for 30 min) and the survivors, including heat-injured cells, were enumerated using standard protocols. A binary logistic regression model was fitted for evaluating the severity of risk. The influence of total solids, water activity, and pH variability were also studied on Listeria survival. The enrichment protocol, using buffered Listeria enrichment broth, followed by plating on modified oxford agar and Rapid L'mono medium, revealed the random presence of heat-injured cells in buffered Listeria enrichment broth, only at the highest dose level of 4+ logs. Any potential risk from heat-injured cells was thus limited only to the highest levels of cross contamination, irrespective of the type of the mix. Significantly, none of the pasteurized ice cream mix samples supported the recovery of any heat-injured cells of Listeria during 72 h holding at 7°C, even at the highest dose level of 4+ logs, under the conditions of experimentation.

A combined testing strategy, consisting of screening and confirmatory methods, was assumed as well as testing of pooled samples. Two optimization models were built using linear programming. The first model aimed to minimize monitoring costs subject to a minimum required effectiveness of finding an incident, whereas the second model aimed to maximize the effectiveness for a given monitoring budget. Our results show that a high level of effectiveness is possible, but at high costs. Given specific assumptions, monitoring with 95% effectiveness to detect an incident of 1 contaminated farm at a dioxin concentration of 2 pg of toxic equivalents/g of fat [European Commission's (EC) action level] costs €2.6 million per month. At the same level of effectiveness, a 73% cost reduction is possible when aiming to detect an incident where 2 farms are contaminated at a dioxin concentration of 3 pg of toxic equivalents/g of fat (EC maximum level). With a fixed budget of €40,000 per month, the probability of detecting an incident with a single contaminated farm at a dioxin concentration equal to the EC action level is 4.4%. This probability almost doubled (8.0%) when aiming to detect the same incident but with a dioxin concentration equal to the EC maximum level. This study shows that the effectiveness of finding an incident depends not only on the ratio at which, for testing, collected truck samples are mixed into a pooled sample (aiming at detecting certain concentration), but also the number of collected truck samples. In conclusion, the optimal cost-effective monitoring depends on the number of contaminated farms and the concentration aimed at detection. The models and study results offer quantitative support to risk managers of food industries and food safety authorities."

However, because several approaches are available, it is difficult for farmers to select the appropriate one to achieve high quality recycled manure solids (RMS). Whereas 3 solid-liquid manure separators were compared in part I of the series (companion paper in this issue), the present study (part II) aims to assess the performance of 4 composting methods (static or turned windrow and drum composter for 24 or 72 h) under laboratory conditions. Parameters evaluated included temperature, physico-chemical characteristics, and bacterial composition of RMS, as well as airborne microorganisms, dust, and gases associated with composting RMS. Because each treatment attained the desired composting temperature range of 40 to 65°C (either in heaps or in the drum composter), reductions in bacteria were a better indicator of the sanitation efficiency. The treatment of fresh RMS in a drum composter for 24 h showed decreased bacterial counts, especially for Escherichia coli (from 1.0 × 105 to 2.0 × 101 cfu/g of dry matter) and Klebsiella spp. (from 3.2 × 104 to 4.0 × 102 cfu/g of dry matter). Increasing the time spent in the rotating vessel to 72 h did not result in further decreases of these pathogens. Composting in a static or turned windrow achieved similar E. coli and Klebsiella spp. reductions as the 24-h drum composting but in 5 or 10 d, and generally showed the lowest occupational exposure risk for dairy farmers regarding concentrations of airborne mesophilic bacteria, mesophilic and thermotolerant fungi, and total dust. Drum-composted RMS stored in piles exhibited intermediate to high risk. Composting approaches did not have a major influence on the physico-chemical characteristics of RMS and gas emissions. Drum composting for 24 h was the best compromise in terms of product quality, temperature reached, decreased bacterial numbers, and emitted airborne contaminants. However, because levels of pathogenic agents rapidly increase once composted RMS are spread in stalls, bacteriological characteristics of RMS along with milk quality and animal health and welfare features should be monitored in Canadian dairy barns applying recommended separation (part I) and composting (part II) systems to evaluate health risk and optimize management practices."

Content thematic analysis identified food safety challenges. Cow milk products (N = 290) were collected from farms (N = 63), collection centers (N = 5), shops/kiosks (N = 37), milk bars (N = 17), roadside vendors (N = 14), restaurants (N = 3), milk vending machines (N = 2), mobile traders (N = 2) and a supermarket (N = 1). Mean values of colony-forming units for TBC and TCC were referenced to East African Standards (EAS). Logistic regression analysis assessed differences in milk acceptability based on EAS. The raw milk from farms and collection centers was relatively within acceptable EAS limits in terms of TBC (3.5 × 105 and 1.4 × 106 respectively) but TCC in the milk from farms was 3 times higher than EAS limits (1.5 × 105). Compared to farms, the odds ratio of milk acceptability based on TBC was lower on milk bars (0.02), restaurants (0.02), roadside vendors (0.03), shops/kiosks (0.07), and supermarkets (0.17). For TCC, the odds that milk samples from collection centers, milk bars, restaurants, roadside vendors, and shops/kiosks were acceptable was less than the odds of samples collected from farms (0.18, 0.03, 0.06, 0.02, and 0.12, respectively). Comparison of raw milk across the nodes showed that the odds of milk samples from restaurants, roadside vendors, and shops/kiosks being acceptable were less than the odds of samples collected the farm for TBC (0.03, 0.04, and 0.04, respectively).

An important public policy issue is to develop and implement prudent use practices where antimicrobials are used. As policy develops, there are questions regarding the use of antimicrobials in animal agriculture and whether these uses constitute prudent use. A series of papers assessing the risk to the public health from agricultural use of antimicrobials have consistently concluded that risk estimation is hampered by the lack of data that describe the amount, types, and uses of antimicrobials in animal agriculture. The absence of information has spurred efforts to develop a framework to collect these data. However, the reasons and benefit of collecting these data should be carefully defined. The dairy industry, contrasted to other major animal commodities, is not focused on meat production but on milk production. Milk production is constrained by disease and antimicrobial treatment is a common management tool, but unlike many other animal agricultural systems where the value and safety of the product is measured in the future; the value of milk is zero when an antimicrobial is used in a lactating cow and milk must be discarded because of residues. While there are exceptions, e. g. non-lactating cow therapy, this difference results in antimicrobials being used sporadically and directed at therapy rather than prophylactic uses. In the dairy industry, antimicrobial use data and its consequences may exist in sufficient detail or could be estimated from existing datasets without the expense of additional surveys. Finally, the main food product milk is mainly pasteurized and all shipments of milk from the farm to the processing plant are tested for the presence of antimicrobials. This makes the likelihood of farm-origin antimicrobials or bacteria appearing in finished product very low. This suggests that the use and quantity of antimicrobials in the dairy system has little impact on public health. This does not imply that the dairy industry does not have a significant role in developing guidelines for appropriate and careful application of antimicrobials, but the effort and cost to collect additional data should be used to fund efforts that improve our diagnostic and managerial skills. These data would change the use of antimicrobials by decreasing the rates of disease and ultimately decreasing prophylactic, metaphylactic and therapeutic use of antimicrobial. These studies and outcome are as important to the dairy industry as to public health."

S. aureus was found in 53.0% (95% CI: 40.6-65.4%) of 100 raw cow's milk samples collected from bulk cooling tanks. The highest contamination level was 3.4 log10 CFU. mL-1, and in some samples more than one S. aureus strain was identified. Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEA-SEE) were detected in one sample. Spa typing revealed 62 distinct S. aureus isolates, being t529 (17.7%, 95% CI: 8.2-27.3%) and t1403 (16.1%, 95% CI: 7.0-25.3%) the predominant types, commonly associated with livestock infection or carriage. The antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that 35.5% of the S. aureus isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent, with resistance to penicillin being the highest (32.3%, 95% CI: 20.6-43.9%) followed by tetracycline (24.2%, 95% CI: 13.5-34.9%), ciprofloxacin (16.1%, 95% CI: 7.0-25.3%) and chloramphenicol (16.1%, 95% CI: 7.0-25.3%).

The presence of foodborne pathogens in milk is due to direct contact with contaminated sources in the dairy farm environment and to excretion from the udder of an infected animal. Most milk is pasteurized, so why should the dairy industry be concerned about the microbial quality of bulk tank milk? There are several valid reasons, including (1) outbreaks of disease in humans have been traced to the consumption of unpasteurized milk and have also been traced back to pasteurized milk, (2) unpasteurized milk is consumed directly by dairy producers, farm employees, and their families, neighbors, and raw milk advocates, (3) unpasteurized milk is consumed directly by a large segment of the population via consumption of several types of cheeses manufactured from unpasteurized milk, (4) entry of foodborne pathogens via contaminated raw milk into dairy food processing plants can lead to persistence of these pathogens in biofilms, and subsequent contamination of processed milk products and exposure of consumers to pathogenic bacteria, (5) pasteurization may not destroy all foodborne pathogens in milk, and (6) inadequate or faulty pasteurization will not destroy all foodborne pathogens. Furthermore, pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes can survive and thrive in post-pasteurization processing environments, thus leading to recontamination of dairy products. These pathways pose a risk to the consumer from direct exposure to foodborne pathogens present in unpasteurized dairy products as well as dairy products that become re-contaminated after pasteurization. The purpose of this communication is to review literature published on the prevalence of bacterial foodborne pathogens in milk and in the dairy environment, and to discuss public health and food safety issues associated with foodborne pathogens found in the dairy environment. Information presented supports the model in which the presence of pathogens depends on ingestion of contaminated feed followed by amplification in bovine hosts and fecal dissemination in the farm environment. The final outcome of this cycle is a constantly maintained reservoir of foodborne pathogens that can reach humans by direct contact, ingestion of raw contaminated milk or cheese, or contamination during the processing of milk products. Isolation of bacterial pathogens with similar biotypes from dairy farms and from outbreaks of human disease substantiates this hypothesis."

Animals shedding E. coli O157 at >10,000 CFU/g of feces have been deemed super-shedders. There is a gap in the knowledge regarding super-shedding of other STEC serogroups. A cohort of 40 lactating cows from herds previously identified as positive for STEC in a national surveillance project were sampled every second month between August, 2013 and July, 2014. Metadata on any potential super-shedders was documented including, e. g. , age of the animal, number of lactations and days in lactation, nutritional condition, somatic cell count and content of protein in milk to assess if any were associated with risk factors for super-shedding. Recto-anal mucosal swabs (RAMS), raw milk, milk filters, and water samples were procured for each herd. The swabs were examined for E. coli O157 and O26 using a quantitative real time PCR method. Counts (CFU swab-1) were obtained from a standard calibration curve that related real-time PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values against the initial concentration of O157 or O26 in the samples.

All cattle were administered 2 doses of 1.1mg of FLU/kg at 12-h intervals by intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous injections. The washout period between routes of administration was 7d. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein before FLU administration and at various time points up to 36 h after the first dose of FLU.

For FLU plasma samples, a difference in terminal half-life was observed among routes of administration. Harmonic mean terminal half-lives for FLU were 3.42, 4.48, and 5.39 h for intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous injection, respectively. The mean bioavailability following intramuscular and subcutaneous dosing was 84.5 and 104.2%, respectively. The decrease in 5OH milk concentration versus time after last dose was analyzed with the nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach and indicated that both the route of administration and rate of milk production were significant covariates. The number of milk samples greater than the tolerance limit for each route of administration was also compared at each time point for statistical significance. Forty-eight hours after the first dose, 5OH milk concentrations were undetectable in all intravenously injected cows; however, one intramuscularly injected and one subcutaneously injected cow had measurable concentrations. These cows had 5OH concentrations above the tolerance limit at the 36-h withdrawal time. The high number of FLU residues identified in cull dairy cows by the United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety Inspection Service is likely related to administration of the drug by an unapproved route. Cattle that received FLU by the approved (intravenous) route consistently eliminated the drug before the approved withdrawal times; however, residues can persist beyond these approved times following intramuscular or subcutaneous administration.

Previous research showed living near cattle and contact with cattle feces as significant risk factors for STEC infections in humans in New Zealand, but infection was not linked to food-associated factors. During the 2014 spring calving season, a random, stratified, cross-sectional study of dairy farms (n = 102) in six regions across New Zealand assessed the prevalence of the ""Top 7"" STEC bacteria (serogroups O157, O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145) in young calves (n = 1,508), using a culture-independent diagnostic test (PCR/MALDI-TOF). Twenty percent (306/1,508) of calves on 75% (76/102) of dairy farms were positive for at least one of the ""Top 7"" STEC bacteria. STEC carriage by calves was associated with environmental factors, increased calf age, region, and increased number of calves in a shared calf pen. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ρ) indicated strong clustering of ""Top 7"" STEC-positive calves for O157, O26, and O45 serogroups within the same pens and farms, indicating that if one calf was positive, others in the same environment were likely to be positive as well. This finding was further evaluated with whole-genome sequencing, which indicated that a single E. coli O26 clonal strain could be found in calves in the same pen or farm, but different strains existed on different farms. This study provides evidence that would be useful for designing on-farm interventions to reduce direct and indirect human exposure to STEC bacteria.

The most prevalent gene detected was lpfAO113 (40.5%), followed by ehaA (32.4%,), astA (3.15%,), iha (1.80%), hlyA (1.35%), stx1 (0.90%), stx2 (0.90%), eaeA (0.45%), cdt-III (0.45%) and cnf2 (0.45%). Two strains isolated from Karish cheese harbored 5 virulence genes (stx1, stx2, iha, ehaA, lpfAO113). Stx subtype was determined to be stx1 (not stx1c or stx1d) and stx2d. Indeed, expression of hemolysin A, CDT-III, CNF-II, Stx1 and Stx2d was confirmed by blood agar plate, cytotoxicity assay and Western blotting, respectively. Among the 222 E. coli strains, 54 (48.6%), 38 (42.6%) and 12 (54.7%) isolated from raw milk, Karish cheese and Ras cheese were potentially virulent, respectively. O-genotyping indicated that most of the potentially virulent E. coli isolates did not belong to clinically important O serogroups except O75, O91 and O166, which have been associated with human diseases. Phylogenetic grouping revealed that 150 (67.6%), 67 (30.2%) and 5 (2.30%) strains were clustered into A, B1 and D groups, respectively, which are considered to be associated with intestinal infection, indicating that these E. coli strains might have a potential to cause gastroenteritis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study regarding prevalence and pathogenic potential of E. coli in dairy products in Egypt. Raw milk, Karish cheese and Ras cheese in Egypt are highly contaminated with E. coli including potentially pathogenic strains, which may impose a public health threat."

Our previous studies have suggested that the gut microbiota plays an important role in the development of mastitis in mice. However, the effects of rumen microbiota on bovine mastitis and the related mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we assessed the effects and mechanisms of rumen microbiota on bovine mastitis based on the subacute rumen acidosis (SARA) model induced by feeding Holstein Frisian cows a high-concentrate diet for 8 weeks. Then, the inflammatory responses in the mammary gland and the bacterial communities of rumen fluid, feces, and milk were analyzed. The results showed that SARA induced mastitis symptoms in the mammary gland; activated a systemic inflammatory response; and increased the permeability of the blood-milk barrier, gut barrier, and rumen barrier. Further research showed that lipopolysaccharides (LPS), derived from the gut of SARA cows, translocated into the blood and accumulated in the mammary glands. Furthermore, the abundance of Stenotrophomonas was increased in the rumen of SARA cows, and mastitis was induced by oral administration of Stenotrophomonas in lactating mice. In conclusion, our findings suggested that mastitis is induced by exogenous pathogenic microorganisms as well as by endogenous pathogenic factors. Specifically, the elevated abundance of Stenotrophomonas in the rumen and LPS translocation from the rumen to the mammary gland were important endogenous factors that induced mastitis. Our study provides a foundation for novel therapeutic strategies that target the rumen microbiota in cow mastitis. IMPORTANCE Mastitis is a common and frequently occurring disease of humans and animals, especially in dairy farming, which has caused huge economic losses and brought harmful substance residues, drug-resistant bacteria, and other public health risks. The traditional viewpoint indicates that mastitis is mainly caused by exogenous pathogenic bacteria infecting the mammary gland. Our study found that the occurrence of mastitis was induced by the endogenous pathway. Evidence has shown that rumen-derived LPS enters the mammary gland through blood circulation, damaging the blood-milk barrier and then inducing inflammation of the mammary gland in cows. In addition, a higher abundance of Stenotrophomonas in the rumen was closely associated with the development of mastitis. This study provides a basis for novel therapeutic strategies that exploit the rumen microbiota against mastitis in cows."

Dressing was inoculated with 3 different commercial protective cultures-PC1 (mix of Lacticaseibacillus spp. and Lactiplantibacillus spp. ), PC2 (Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus), and PC3 (Lactic. rhamnosus)-following the manufacturer recommended dosage and then mixed with curd. A control with no protective culture was included. Nine species of yeast (Candida zeylanoides, Clavispora lusitaniae, Debaryomyces hansenii, Debaryomyces prosopidis, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Meyerozyma guilliermondii, Pichia fermentans, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, and Torulaspora delbrueckii) and 11 species of mold (Aspergillus cibarius, Aureobasidium pullulans, Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium citrinum, Penicillium commune, Penicillium decumbens, Penicillium roqueforti, Mucor genevensis, Mucor racemosus, Phoma dimorpha, and Trichoderma amazonicum) were included in the study. Fungi strains were previously isolated from dairy processing environments and were inoculated onto the cheese surface at a rate of 20 cfu/g. Cheese was stored at 6 ± 2°C. Yeast levels were enumerated at 0, 7, 14, and 21 d postinoculation. Mold growth was visually observed on a weekly basis through d 42 of storage and imaged. Overall, the protective cultures were limited in their ability to delay the outgrowth in cottage cheese, with only 8 of the 20 fungal strains showing an effect of the cultures compared with the control. The protective cultures were not very effective against yeast, with only PC1 able to delay the outgrowth of 3 strains: D. hansenii, Tor. delbrueckii, and Mey. guilliermondii. The efficacy of these protective cultures against molds in cottage cheese was more promising, with all protective cultures showing the ability to delay spoilage of at least 1 mold strain. Both PC1 and PC2 were able to delay Pen. chrysogenum and Pho. dimorpha outgrowth, and PC1 also delayed Pen. commune, Pen. decumbens, and Pen. roqueforti to different extents compared with the controls. This study demonstrates that commercial lactic acid bacteria cultures vary in their performance to delay mold and yeast outgrowth, and thus each protective culture should be evaluated against the specific strains of fungi of concern within each specific dairy facility."

Liposomes were prepared through a reverse‐phase evaporation method and conjugated with goat anti‐Salmonella immunoglobulin G (IgG) in order to produce immunoliposomes. For the developed assay, a plastic‐backed nitrocellulose strip (HiFlow Plus HFB09004, Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA) was coated with two antibody zones. The lower zone (test line) of the strip was coated with 11.2 μg/μL of laboratory‐produced rabbit anti‐S. Typhimurium IgG, while the upper zone (control line) was coated with 1.2 μg/μL of rabbit anti‐goat IgG. The prepared strips were allowed for capillary migration with wicking solution (mixture of diluted liposome and bacterial culture). S. Typhimurium was captured with surface bound immunoliposomes at lower zone, while the unbound liposomes migrated and bounded to the upper zone. The detection limit of the developed immunochromatographic strip assay was found to be 10⁶–10⁷ cfu/mL with a total analysis time of 10 min. When the cross‐reactivity of the developed laboratory‐produced rabbit anti‐S. Typhimurium IgG coated immunochromatographic strips were compared with commercial immunochromatographic detection kit and commercial antibody‐coated immunochromatographic strips, the developed test strips showed similar detection limit to commercial ones; however, they were specific to S. Typhimurium only. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Salmonella pathogens have become major cause of food‐borne diseases worldwide, raising a great safety concern to consumers and public health. A number of Salmonella serotypes responsible for severe foodborne outbreaks are found in various foods including fresh vegetables, dairy and meat products, as well as in human host.

In this study, 120 samples of white cheese, cheddar cheese, Cypriot Halloumi, braid cheese and cream cheese were evaluated for Escherichia coli contamination, and also, antibiotic resistance patterns of strains were examined. For this purpose, totally 600 cheese samples were analyzed and 67 of those (11.16%) were found to be contaminated with E. coli. On the other hand, the survey was designed for veterinarians who work in dairy cattle farms. The survey was not only questioning antibiotic administration, but it was also determining the usage of antimicrobials both in prophylaxis and in treatment of mastitis. Erythromycin and gentamycin are mostly preferred antibiotic with a ratio of 100% by veterinarians. These two antibiotics were followed by cephapirin, neomycin, cephalosporin, penicillin G, amoxicillin, oxytetracycline, pirlimycin with a ratio of 92, 87, 85, 85, 79, 78 and 68, respectively. Data acquired from this study indicate that there is a significant relation between field applications of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance patterns of E. coli in cheese. The results of this study underline the effect of a massive administration of antimicrobials for both in prophylaxis and in treatment of mastitis which may also trigger an antimicrobial resistance in E. coli strains. This is not only important for antimicrobial resistance of E. coli isolated from cheese, but also for a possibility of plasmid resistance that can lead to conjugation with other bacteria. In case the above mentioned case occurs, this may cause a significant public health problem. Practical Applications: This paper represents data about the incidence and antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli strains isolated from different cheese types in Turkey. The results of the survey underline a strong correlation between antimicrobial resistance of E. coli and reckless massive administration of antimicrobial agents. The aim of this paper is to help trigger different surveys which will be designed to determine antimicrobial administration by veterinarians working at farm level. The design of this study shows that further studies are needed to contribute and strengthen the laboratory data that we have found. The results of this study underline practical application of field surveys which will help strengthen the meaning of antimicrobial resistance data.

Experts were interviewed remotely and completed calibration questions during the interview without access to any resources. They then completed target questions after the interview, using resources as considered necessary. Expert data were validated using two objective measures, calibration score or statistical accuracy, and information score. Performance-based weights were derived from the two measures to aggregate experts' distributions into a so-called decision maker. The analysis was made using Excalibur software, and resulting distributions were normalized using Monte Carlo simulation. Individual experts' uncertainty assessments resulted in modest statistical accuracy and high information scores, suggesting overconfident assessments. Nevertheless, the optimized item-weighted decision maker was statistically accurate and informative. While there is no evidence that animal pathogenic ETEC strains are infectious to humans, a sizeable proportion of ETEC illness was attributed to animal source foods as experts considered contamination of food products by infected food handlers can occur at any step in the food chain. For all pathogens, a major share of the burden was attributed to food groups of interest. Within food groups, the highest attribution was to products consumed raw, but processed products were also considered important sources of infection. Cooke's Classical Model with performance-based weighting provided robust uncertainty estimates of the attribution of foodborne disease in three African countries. Attribution estimates will be combined with country-level estimates of the burden of foodborne disease to inform decision making by national authorities."

Following this environmental disaster, we investigated the consequences of long-term exposure to contaminated drinking water on the microbiome and resistome of dairy cattle. We identified bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in the feces, rumen fluid, and nasopharynx of 16 dairy cattle 4 years after the environmental disaster. Cattle had been continuously exposed to heavy metal contaminated water until sample collection (A) and compared them to analogous samples from 16 dairy cattle in an unaffected farm, 356 km away (B). The microbiome and resistome of farm A and farm B differed in many aspects. The distribution of genes present in the cattle's nasopharynx, rumen, and feces conferring AMR was highly heterogeneous, and most genes were present in only a few samples. The relative abundance and prevalence (presence/absence) of AMR genes were higher in farm A than in farm B. Samples from farm A had a higher prevalence (presence) of genes conferring resistance to multiple drugs, metals, biocides, and multi-compound resistance. Fecal samples had a higher relative abundance of AMR genes, followed by rumen fluid samples, and the nasopharynx had the lowest relative abundance of AMR genes detected. Metagenome functional annotation suggested that selective pressures of heavy metal exposure potentially skewed pathway diversity toward fewer, more specialized functions. This is the first study that evaluates the consequences of a Brazilian environmental accident with mining ore dam failure in the microbiome of dairy cows. Our findings suggest that the long-term persistence of heavy metals in the environment may result in differences in the microbiota and enrichment of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Our results also suggest that AMR genes are most readily detected in fecal samples compared to rumen and nasopharyngeal samples which had relatively lower bacterial read counts. Since heavy metal contamination has an effect on the animal microbiome, environmental management is warranted to protect the food system from hazardous consequences."

Their suitability regarding both yield and environmental (e. g. nitrate leaching and ammonia volatilization) sustainability, and regional barriers and opportunities for their implementation were also considered. Based on its results best strategies to abate GHG emissions in Mediterranean agro-systems were proposed. Adjusting N fertilization to crop needs in both irrigated and rain-fed systems could reduce N2O emissions up to 50% compared with a non-adjusted practice. Substitution of N synthetic fertilizers by solid manure can be also implemented in those systems, and may abate N2O emissions by about 20% under Mediterranean conditions, with additional indirect benefits associated to energy savings and positive effects in crop yields. The use of urease and nitrification inhibitors enhances N use efficiency of the cropping systems and may mitigate N2O emissions up to 80% and 50%, respectively. The type of irrigation may also have a great mitigation potential in the Mediterranean region. Drip-irrigated systems have on average 80% lower N2O emissions than sprinkler systems and drip-irrigation combined with optimized fertilization showed a reduction in direct N2O emissions up to 50%. Methane fluxes have a relatively small contribution to the total GHG budget of Mediterranean crops, which can mostly be controlled by careful management of the water table and organic inputs in paddies. Reduced soil tillage, improved management of crop residues and agro-industry by-products, and cover cropping in orchards, are the most suitable interventions to enhance organic C stocks in Mediterranean agricultural soils. The adoption of the proposed agricultural practices will require farmers training. The global analysis of life cycle emissions associated to irrigation type (drip, sprinkle and furrow) and N fertilization rate (100 and 300kgNha−1yr−1) revealed that these factors may outweigh the reduction in GHG emissions beyond the plot scale. The analysis of the impact of some structural changes on top-down mitigation of GHG emissions revealed that 3–15% of N2O emissions could be suppressed by avoiding food waste at the end-consumer level. A 40% reduction in meat and dairy consumption could reduce GHG emissions by 20–30%. Reintroducing the Mediterranean diet (i. e. ∼35% intake of animal protein) would therefore result in a significant decrease of GHG emissions from agricultural production systems under Mediterranean conditions."

First, 47 dairy farmers and 44 milk retailers were interviewed to gain more insights in dairy farming and marketing, and associated constraints. Second, bulk milk samples (n=188) were collected for 4 consecutive weeks to investigate milk quality [Total Bacterial Counts (TBC), Coliform Counts (CC), Somatic Cell Counts (SCC), and antimicrobial residues]. Third, (bulk) milk samples from 32 farms, 46 milk retailers and the 3 local milk collection centers were collected to determine the presence of oxacillin susceptible-and oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Seven (26%) of the isolates were resistant to oxacillin suggesting the presence of MRSA (Lee, 2003). Local milk is occasionally consumed by adults but more frequently by children. Adults mainly drink spontaneously fermented milk (57% of 105 interviewees consuming local milk) whereas most milk for children is boiled (86% of 110 households with children consuming local milk). Most consumers are concerned about adulteration and milk borne diseases but not about antimicrobial residues. Educated consumers (secondary school or higher) were more likely to boil milk for own consumption, to be concerned about antimicrobial residues in milk, to be concerned about milk borne diseases and to be willing to pay more for milk with proven good quality compared to poorly educated consumers. We conclude that milk quality incentives should be introduced in Jimma, and investments should be made in knowledge transfer, training, milk collection systems and a central milk quality lab."

For example, salmonellosis remains a burden in developed and developing nations. Rapid and reliable molecular methods to identify Salmonella strains are essential for minimizing human infection. This study aimed to identify Salmonella spp. in raw milk and dairy products using conventional and molecular techniques and to test the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolated strains. One hundred and thirty-one milk and dairy product samples were randomly collected from different localities in Libya. Samples were examined for the presence of Salmonella by conventional culture techniques, including cultivation in Rappaport-Vassiliadis broth and streaking on xylose lysine deoxycholate agar. Identification also used polymerase chain reaction and partial sequencing of 16S rDNA. Twenty-four antibiotics were used for the examination of antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella spp. isolates with the agar disk diffusion method (Kirby-Bauer technique). Multi-antibiotic resistance index and antibiotic resistance index (ARI)for Salmonella enterica isolates were calculated. Twenty-one of 131 samples (16%) were positive for Salmonella spp. recovered from 9 (16%), 2 (11%), 4 (22.2%), and 6 (46%) samples of raw cow milk, fermented raw milk, and fresh locally made soft cheeses, Maasora and Ricotta), respectively. Samples of ice cream, milk powder, and infant formula showed no Salmonella spp. contamination. Only 9 of 21 (42.8%) isolates were confirmed as S. enterica by partial sequence 16S rDNA analysis. All isolates were resistant to amoxycillin, bacitracin, penicillin G, lincomycin, vancomycin, clindamycin, and cloxacillin with an ARI of 0.042. In contrast, all tested strains were sensitive to levofloxacin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin. In addition, all of the tested isolates (100%) were resistant to more than one antibiotic. This study demonstrated the applicability of molecular techniques, compared with conventional methods, as preferable for the identification of Salmonella in milk and dairy products and thus reduction of milk-borne transmission to the consumers. From the view of public health, isolation and identification of Salmonella multidrug-resistant strains from raw cow`s milk and locally prepared dairy products sold in the Libyan markets indicate the need to improve the handling and processing of milk and dairy products to minimize the prevalence of Salmonella, one of the most important foodborne microorganisms that cause food poisoning."

It can cause several diseases, including mastitis, as well as food poisoning by production of heat-stable enterotoxins in food. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of S. aureus and the diversity of strains circulating in the Zambian dairy value chain, which have not been studied in detail before. Three provinces were covered by the study (Lusaka, Southern, and Western) and almost 2000 samples along the dairy value chain, covering both the informal and formal market sectors, were taken at two time points (dry and wet season), with a special focus on raw milk. Nearly 300 presumptive S. aureus isolates were confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS and real-time PCR. Raw milk from traditional and smallholder farms was widely contaminated with S. aureus; prevalence was 33-46% depending on the study province. Raw milk from milk collection centres, informal traders, traditional market sellers, and processors were also frequently contaminated with S. aureus. In addition, S. aureus was detected in several milk bucket swabs and nasal and hand swabs of milkers. From industrially processed (heat-treated) milk and dairy products, no S. aureus was isolated. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were not detected, but around 10% of the S. aureus isolates carried lukS-PV, a marker gene for the virulence factor Pantone-Valentine leucocidin (PVL), which has been associated with severe diseases in human. Molecular typing identified a total of 44 spa types including 13 novel types: t18396, t18397, t18398, t18399, t18400, t18402, t18416, t20459, t20460, t20461, t20462, t20463, and t20464. Furthermore, 12 novel multi-locus sequence types were identified: ST7012, ST7100, ST7101, ST7177, ST7291, ST7304, ST7305, ST7344, ST7596, ST7597, ST7598, and ST7599, of which ST7012, ST7177, and ST7596 fall into the bovine-associated clonal linage CC97. The spa types t084, t267, t355, and the novel type t20464 were common in all three study provinces. The predominant spa type varied depending on the province. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) and core genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST) indicates transmission of strains along the Zambian dairy chain with possible persistence in the chain over time. cgMLST also revealed a very close relatedness between some isolates from milkers and from raw milk or milk buckets. The high prevalence and wide spa type diversity of S. aureus, as well as possible direct or indirect transmission of (potentially highly virulent) S. aureus to humans along the Zambian dairy value chain, are of public health concern, particularly as milk and milk products are often consumed raw by the Zambian population."

Therefore, the function identify_safety_hazards() will return an empty dictionary.</s>","The large size of data sets generated using hyperspectral imaging techniques significantly increases both the capability and difficulty of designing detection and classification systems. Of particular interest is the confluence with increasing use of multispectral imaging in machine vision, particularly in the area of food safety inspection. The purpose of this study was to develop a robust method for selecting one or two wavelengths for multispectral detection systems using hyperspectral data. The actual performance of detection algorithms in terms of true positives and false positives was used as optimization criteria. Detection of fecal contamination on apples is an important health safety issue. Prior observations suggest reflectance or fluorescence imaging in the visible to near-infrared can be used to detect such contamination. For this study, 1:2, 1:20, and 1:200 dilutions of dairy feces were applied to 100 Golden and 100 Red Delicious apples. Apples were imaged using a hyperspectral system, and a uniform power transformation was used to reduce inter-apple intensity variability. Detection was accomplished by applying a binary threshold to transformed single wavelength images and images construct using ratios or differences of images at two different wavelengths. Optimization criteria allowed for a maximum of three false positives. For reflectance imaging, maximum detection rates for 1:20 dilution spots on Golden and Red Delicious apples images were 100% and 62.5% using R816 - R697 and R784 - R738, respectively. For fluorescence imaging, maximum detection rates for 1:200 dilution spots on Golden and Red Delicious apples were 97.9% and 58.3% using F665/F602 and F647/F482, respectively. In all case, more concentrated dilution spots were detected at 100%. Maximum detection rates for Red Delicious apples required use of a Prewitt edge-detection filter. In comparison, tests of wavelengths and algorithms identified in previous studies using statistical methods such as principal component analysis produced lower detection rates, mainly due to problems with false positives. The procedures used for developing detection algorithms are not specific to detecting feces on apples, and it is theoretically easy to extend the results to detection schemes involving many wavelengths. The problem is the classical dilemma of rapidly increasing computational time. Still, given the costs of thoroughly testing a candidate detection algorithm, the time maybe warranted. Furthermore, as machine vision systems are often limited to one or two wavelengths due to practical considerations including cost, exhaustive search algorithms based-on optimizing the output of candidate detection algorithms should be cost-effective."

We show, in this study, that competitive exclusion, i. e. , competition for a limited resource by different organisms, is a major mechanism of fungal growth inhibition by lactobacilli in fermented dairy products. The depletion of the essential trace element manganese by two Lactobacillus species was uncovered as the main mechanism for growth inhibition of dairy spoilage yeast and molds. A manganese transporter (MntH1), representing one of the highest expressed gene products in both lactobacilli, facilitates the exhaustive manganese scavenging. Expression of the mntH1 gene was found to be strain dependent, affected by species coculturing and the growth phase. Further, deletion of the mntH1 gene in one of the strains resulted in a loss of bioactivity, proving this gene to be important for manganese depletion. The presence of an mntH gene displayed a distinct phylogenetic pattern within the Lactobacillus genus. Moreover, assaying the bioprotective ability in fermented milk of selected lactobacilli from 10 major phylogenetic groups identified a correlation between the presence of mntH and bioprotective activity. Thus, manganese scavenging emerges as a common trait within the Lactobacillus genus, but differences in expression result in some strains showing more bioprotective effect than others. In summary, competitive exclusion through ion depletion is herein reported as a novel mechanism in LAB to delay the growth of spoilage contaminants in dairy products. IMPORTANCE In societies that have food choices, conscious consumers demand natural solutions to keep their food healthy and fresh during storage, simultaneously reducing food waste. The use of ""good bacteria"" to protect food against spoilage organisms has a long, successful history, even though the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we show that the depletion of free manganese is a major bioprotective mechanism of lactobacilli in dairy products. High manganese uptake and intracellular storage provide a link to the distinct, nonenzymatic, manganese-catalyzed oxidative stress defense mechanism, previously described for certain lactobacilli. The evaluation of representative Lactobacillus species in our study identifies multiple relevant species groups for fungal growth inhibition via manganese depletion. Hence, through the natural mechanism of nutrient depletion, the use of dedicated bioprotective lactobacilli constitutes an attractive alternative to artificial preservation."

Although cleaning with chlorine-based agents is widely adopted, it has been associated with detrimental effects on milk quality and safety, which has garnered increasing interest in chlorine-free cleaning. However, the influence of these methods on the milk microbiota is not well documented. This study investigated the factors that influence the raw milk microbiota, with a focus on the differences when chlorine-based and chlorine-free cleaning of milking equipment are used. Bulk tank raw milk was sampled during three sampling months (April, August, and November), from farms across Ireland selected to capture the use of different cleaning methods, i. e. , exclusively chlorine-based (n = 51) and chlorine-free cleaning (n = 92) and farms that used chlorine-free agents for the bulk tank and chlorine-based cleaning agents for the rest of the equipment (n = 28). Shotgun metagenomic analysis revealed the significant influence of seasonal and geographic factors on the bulk tank milk microbiota, indicated by differences in diversity, taxonomic composition, and functional characteristics. Taxonomic and functional profiles of samples collected in November clustered separately from those of samples collected in other months. In contrast, cleaning methods only accounted for 1% of the variation in the bulk tank milk bacterial community, and samples collected from farms using chlorine-based versus chlorine-free cleaning did not differ significantly, suggesting that the chlorine-free approaches used did not negatively impact microbiological quality. This study shows the value of shotgun metagenomics in advancing our knowledge of the raw milk microbiota. IMPORTANCE The microbiota of raw milk is affected by many factors that can control or promote the introduction of undesirable microorganisms. Chlorine-based cleaning agents have been commonly used due to their effectiveness in controlling undesirable microorganisms, but they have been associated with the formation of chlorine residues that are detrimental to product quality and may impact consumer health. Chlorine-free alternatives have been recommended in some countries, but the influence of cleaning agents on the milk microbiota is unknown. Here, we investigated the influence of cleaning methods and other factors on bulk tank raw milk. Results showed that season and location had a greater influence on the milk microbiota than the cleaning agents used. Indeed, the similar microbiota compositions of raw milk from farms that used chlorine-based and those that used chlorine-free cleaning methods supports the further use of chlorine-free cleaning agents in dairy production."

We used a combination of PCR/matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to evaluate the presence and transmission of STEC on farms and in processing plants to better understand the potential pathways for human exposure and thus mitigate risk. Animal and environmental samples (n = 2,580) were collected from six farms and three meat processing plants in New Zealand during multiple sampling sessions in spring of 2015 and 2016.

An advanced molecular detection method and whole-genome sequencing were used to provide a detailed evaluation of the transmission of STEC both within and between farms. The study revealed widespread STEC contamination within the farm environment, but no evidence of recent spread between farms. Contamination of young dairy calf hides increased following transport and holding at meat processing plants. The elimination of STEC in farm environments may be very difficult given the multiple transmission routes; interventions should be targeted at decreasing fecal contamination of calf hides during transport, lairage, and processing."

Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous foodborne pathogen widely distributed in food production environments and is the target of numerous control and prevention procedures. Detection of L. monocytogenes in a food production setting requires culture dependent methods, but the complex dynamics of bacterial interactions within these environments and their impact on pathogen detection remains largely unexplored. To address this challenge, we applied both 16S rRNA and shotgun quasimetagenomic (enriched microbiome) sequencing of swab culture enrichments from seafood and dairy production environments. Utilizing 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we observed variability between samples taken from different production facilities and a distinctive microbiome for each environment. With shotgun quasimetagenomic sequencing, we were able to assemble L. monocytogenes metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) and compare these MAGSs to their previously sequenced whole genome sequencing (WGS) assemblies, which resulted in two polyphyletic clades (lineages I and II). Using these same datasets together with in silico downsampling to produce a titration series of proportional abundances of L. monocytogenes , we were able to begin to establish limits for Listeria detection and subtyping using shotgun quasimetagenomics. This study contributes to the understanding of microbial diversity within food production environments and presents insights into how many reads or relative abundance is needed in a metagenome sequencing dataset to detect, subtype, and source track at a SNP level, as well as providing an important foundation for utilizing metagenomics to mitigate unfavorable occurrences along the farm to fork continuum. In developed countries, the human diet is predominantly food commodities, which have been manufactured, processed, and stored in a food production facility.

More than 300 mycotoxins are known today, but only five of them (aflatoxin B1, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisins and ochratoxin A) are regulated by EU legislation for animal feed. The current study reflects the requirements of the European Food Safety Authority for gathering the data allowing reliable quantitative exposure assessments. This is the first report combining the data for the occurrence of 56 mycotoxins produced by Fusarium, Alternaria, Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Claviceps fungi species in 18 classes of non-fermented or fermented feedingstuffs, feedingstuff supplements, and complex compound feeds (altogether 343 samples collected between 2008 and 2012). Samples were extracted by the QuEChERS (Quick Easy Cheap Rugged and Safe) procedure. For separation and target mycotoxins detection, ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was employed. In most of the investigated feedingstuff commodities, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisins, ochratoxin A, enniatins, beauvericin, Alternaria toxins, ergot alkaloids, roquefortine C and mycophenolic acid were quantified, in some cases at concentrations up to thousands of μg/kg, depending on the composition of the particular sample. The broadest spectrum of detected mycotoxins, as well as the highest concentrations, was quantified in dried distillers’ grains with solubles (DDGS). Based on the performed analyses, the dietary intake of particular mycotoxins was estimated considering the feedingstuffs consumption by the respective farm animal. It was found that the most significant exposure of animals occurred after the consumption of ‘basic’ feedings, i. e. maize silage and complex compound feeds for dairy cattle (average dietary intake for the most important mycotoxins were 2.3–5.4μg/kg of BW for nivalenol, 9.2–10.8μg/kg of BW for deoxynivalenol, 1–1.4μg/kg of BW for FUS-X, 0.2–0.4μg/kg of BW for zearalenone, 0.03–1.8 for enniatins, and 0.5–5.4μg/kg of BW for mycophenolic acid), complex compound feeds for pigs (in average 12μg/kg of BW for deoxynivalenol, 0.8μg/kg of BW for zearalenone, 0.3μg/kg of BW for fumonisin B1, and 1.8–9.2μg/kg of BW for enniatins), and complex compound feeds for chickens and laying hens (18.2μg/kg of BW for deoxynivalenol, 1.1μg/kg of BW for HT-2 toxin, 0.1μg/kg of BW for zearalenone, and 0.4–3.9μg/kg of BW for enniatins). Nevertheless, quite high animal exposure to mycotoxins was calculated also for maize-based DDGS usually used as a supplementary feed. In spite of a lower dosage of these feedingstuff supplements, relatively high mycotoxins concentrations determined here caused the increased dietary intake."

The safety of these food additives is debated, with conflicting findings regarding their role in the aetiology of various diseases. In particular, their carcinogenicity has been suggested by several experimental studies, but robust epidemiological evidence is lacking. Thus, our objective was to investigate the associations between artificial sweetener intakes (total from all dietary sources, and most frequently consumed ones: aspartame [E951], acesulfame-K [E950], and sucralose [E955]) and cancer risk (overall and by site). Overall, 102,865 adults from the French population-based cohort NutriNet-Santé (2009-2021) were included (median follow-up time = 7.8 years). Dietary intakes and consumption of sweeteners were obtained by repeated 24-hour dietary records including brand names of industrial products. Associations between sweeteners and cancer incidence were assessed by Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age, sex, education, physical activity, smoking, body mass index, height, weight gain during follow-up, diabetes, family history of cancer, number of 24-hour dietary records, and baseline intakes of energy, alcohol, sodium, saturated fatty acids, fibre, sugar, fruit and vegetables, whole-grain foods, and dairy products. Compared to non-consumers, higher consumers of total artificial sweeteners (i. e. , above the median exposure in consumers) had higher risk of overall cancer (n = 3,358 cases, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.13 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.25], P-trend = 0.002). In particular, aspartame (HR = 1.15 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.28], P = 0.002) and acesulfame-K (HR = 1.13 [95% CI 1.01 to 1.26], P = 0.007) were associated with increased cancer risk. Higher risks were also observed for breast cancer (n = 979 cases, HR = 1.22 [95% CI 1.01 to 1.48], P = 0.036, for aspartame) and obesity-related cancers (n = 2,023 cases, HR = 1.13 [95% CI 1.00 to 1.28], P = 0.036, for total artificial sweeteners, and HR = 1.15 [95% CI 1.01 to 1.32], P = 0.026, for aspartame). Limitations of this study include potential selection bias, residual confounding, and reverse causality, though sensitivity analyses were performed to address these concerns. In this large cohort study, artificial sweeteners (especially aspartame and acesulfame-K), which are used in many food and beverage brands worldwide, were associated with increased cancer risk. These findings provide important and novel insights for the ongoing re-evaluation of food additive sweeteners by the European Food Safety Authority and other health agencies globally.

This study is carried out to isolate and identify the possible common bacteria which cause milk contamination and the risks associated with it in Biharwe. A cross-sectional study was carried out in Biharwe small holder dairy farms, Kashari Sub County, Mbarara district, from March 2022 to October 2022 to assess bacterial contamination, isolate, identify, and test antibiotic susceptibility patterns of organisms. A total of 20 milk samples were randomly collected from 20 privately owned small holder dairy farms with healthy lactating animals. Isolation and identification of organisms was carried out by using biochemical tests. The bacteria so identified and their isolation rate were E. coli (20%), Citrobacter freundii (40%), Enterobacter Cloacae (30%), Enterobacter agglomerans (10%). These are indicative of significant contamination of milk and important human pathogens. The antibiotic susceptibility test was performed on Mueller-Hinton agar by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. About 100 % of E. coli isolates was sensitive to Tetracycline with 0% resistance, 75% of Citrobacter freundii was sensitive to Tetracycline with 25% resistant isolates, 100% of Entrobacter cloacae was sensitive to Tetracycline with 0% resistance, and 100% of E. agglomerans was sensitive with 0% resistance. Overall 90% of the isolates were sensitive to Tetracycline with only 10% resistance. All the bacterial isolates were 100% sensitive to Gentamicin with 0% resistant. 100% of Citrobacter freundii, Entrobacter cloacae and Enterobacter agglomerans isolateswas resistant to Ampicillin while only 50% of E. coli isolates was sensitive to Ampicillin. 100% of Entrobacter cloacae, E. coli and Enterobacter agglomerans isolates was sensitive to Streptomycin while 75% of Citrobacter freundii was sensitive and 25% was resistant to Streptomycin. Citrobacter freundii was the only isolated organism resistant to more than one antibiotic (100% resistant to Ampicillin and 25% resistant to Tetracycline and Streptomycin). Therefore, the pattern of antibiotic susceptibility tests among the isolates is statistically significant in Gentamicin (P=0.00). This study revealed that raw cow’s milk in the study area could be an important source of infection with a wide range of organisms, particularly gram-negative bacteria. An important source of microbial contamination of milk is fecal pollution probably cow dung. There is need for instituting effective control measures to protect public health. This includes mandatory milk pasteurization by traders and improved hygienic handling of containers during milking, ensuring milking is not done on floors with cow dung."

Although some determinants of PFAS exposure have been suggested, the role of geographic location and race/ethnicity in PFAS exposure has not been well characterized. We examined potential determinants of PFAS from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). This study includes 1302 women aged 45-56 years from 5 SWAN sites where white women and women from one minority group were recruited (black from Southeast Michigan, Pittsburgh, Boston; Chinese from Oakland; Japanese from Los Angeles). We determined concentrations of 11 PFAS in serum samples collected in 1999-2000 and examined 7 PFAS detected in most women (>97%). Linear regression with backward elimination was used to identify important determinants of PFAS serum concentrations among a set of pre-specified variables (age, body mass index, site, race/ethnicity, education, financial hardship, occupation, born outside the United States (US), parity, menstrual bleeding within the past year, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and consumption of fish, dairy, pizza, salty snack, and French fries). Site and race/ethnicity were two major determinants of PFAS. White women had higher concentrations of linear perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) compared with the Chinese in Oakland (p < 0.0001) and blacks in Pittsburgh (p = 0.048). Black women in Southeast Michigan and Boston (vs. white women) had higher concentrations of linear (p < 0.001 for Southeast Michigan; p < 0.0001 for Boston) and total perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (p < 0.001 for both Southeast Michigan and Boston) and 2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid (p = 0.02 for Southeast Michigan; p < 0.001 for Boston). Chinese (Oakland) and Japanese (Los Angeles) women had higher concentrations of perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) compared with white women in each site (p < 0.01 for both). Within white women, those in Pittsburgh had relatively higher concentrations of PFAS. Within Chinese and Japanese women, those who were born outside the US had significantly lower concentrations of most PFAS but significantly higher PFNA concentrations. Menstrual bleeding and parity were significantly associated with lower PFAS concentrations. Higher intake of salty snacks including popcorn was significantly associated with higher concentrations of linear PFOA, PFOS and 2-(N-ethyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid. Geographic locations and race/ethnicity play an important role in differential exposure to PFAS, with racial/ethnic burdens differing between PFOS, PFOA and PFNA. Menstruation and parity were also determinants of PFAS concentrations possibly as an elimination route."

Groundwater NO3(-)-N concentrations were collected biannually for 3 years at 88 sites within the Waikato Region of New Zealand. The land use was classed as either the predominant land use of the farm where the well or bore was located, or the dominant land use within a 500 m radius of the well or bore. Topsoil properties that affect the ability of soil to generate nitrate were also measured at all the sites, and a leaching risk assessment model 'DRASTIC' was used to assess the risk of NO3(-)-N leaching to groundwater at each site. The concentration of NO3(-)-N in shallow groundwater in the Waikato Region varied considerably, both temporally and spatially. Nine percent of sites surveyed had groundwater NO3(-)-N concentrations exceeding maximum allowable concentrations of 11.3 ppm recommended by the World Health Organisation for potable drinking water which is accepted as a public health standard in New Zealand. Over half (56%) of the sites had concentrations that exceeded 3 ppm, indicating effects of human activities (commonly referred to as a human activity value). Very few trends in NO3(-)-N concentration that could be attributed to land use were identified, although market garden sites had higher concentrations of NO3(-)-N in underlying groundwater than drystock/sheep sites when the land use within 500 m radius of a sampling site was used to define the land use. There was also some evidence that within a district, NO3(-)-N concentrations in groundwater increased as the proportion of area used for dairy farming increased. Compared to pastoral land, market gardens had lower total C and N, potentially mineralisable N and denitrifying enzyme assay. However, none of these soil properties were directly related to groundwater NO3(-)-N concentrations. Instead, the DRASTIC index (which ranks sites according to their risk of solute leaching) gave the best correlation with groundwater NO3(-)-N concentrations. The permeability of the vadose zone was the most important parameter. The three approaches used were all considered unsuitable for assessing nitrate concentrations of groundwater, although a best-fit combination of parameters measured was able to account for nearly half the variance in groundwater NO3(-)-N concentrations. We suggest that non-point source groundwater NO3(-)-N contamination in the region reflects the intensive agricultural practices, and that localised, site-specific, factors may affect NO3(-)-N concentrations in shallow groundwaters as much as the general land use in the surrounding area."

This study aimed to examine the associations of egg and cholesterol intakes with mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and other causes in a US population. Overall, 521,120 participants (aged 50-71 years, mean age = 62.2 years, 41.2% women, and 91.8% non-Hispanic white) were recruited from 6 states and 2 additional cities in the US between 1995 and 1996 and prospectively followed up until the end of 2011. Intakes of whole eggs, egg whites/substitutes, and cholesterol were assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire. Cause-specific hazard models considering competing risks were used, with the lowest quintile of energy-adjusted intake (per 2,000 kcal per day) as the reference. There were 129,328 deaths including 38,747 deaths from CVD during a median follow-up of 16 years. Whole egg and cholesterol intakes were both positively associated with all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality. In multivariable-adjusted models, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) associated with each intake of an additional half of a whole egg per day were 1.07 (1.06-1.08) for all-cause mortality, 1.07 (1.06-1.09) for CVD mortality, and 1.07 (1.06-1.09) for cancer mortality. Each intake of an additional 300 mg of dietary cholesterol per day was associated with 19%, 16%, and 24% higher all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality, respectively. Mediation models estimated that cholesterol intake contributed to 63.2% (95% CI 49.6%-75.0%), 62.3% (95% CI 39.5%-80.7%), and 49.6% (95% CI 31.9%-67.4%) of all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality associated with whole egg consumption, respectively. Egg white/substitute consumers had lower all-cause mortality and mortality from stroke, cancer, respiratory disease, and Alzheimer disease compared with non-consumers. Hypothetically, replacing half a whole egg with equivalent amounts of egg whites/substitutes, poultry, fish, dairy products, or nuts/legumes was related to lower all-cause, CVD, cancer, and respiratory disease mortality. Study limitations include its observational nature, reliance on participant self-report, and residual confounding despite extensive adjustment for acknowledged dietary and lifestyle risk factors. In this study, intakes of eggs and cholesterol were associated with higher all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality. The increased mortality associated with egg consumption was largely influenced by cholesterol intake. Our findings suggest limiting cholesterol intake and replacing whole eggs with egg whites/substitutes or other alternative protein sources for facilitating cardiovascular health and long-term survival.

In this study, we report the results of a dairy calf efficacy trial of the methionyl-tRNA ( Cp MetRS) synthetase inhibitor 2093 and the spontaneous emergence of drug resistance. Dairy calves experimentally infected with Cryptosporidium parvum initially improved with 2093 treatment, but parasite shedding resumed in two of three calves on treatment day five. Parasites shed by each recrudescent calf had different amino acid altering CpMetRS mutations, coding either an aspartate 243 to glutamate (D243E) or a threonine 246 to isoleucine (T246I) mutation. Transgenic parasites engineered to have either the D243E or T246I Cp MetRS mutation using CRISPR/Cas9 grew normally but were highly 2093 resistant; the D243E and T246I mutant expressing parasites respectively had 2093 EC 50S of 613- or 128-fold that of transgenic parasites with wild-type Cp MetRS. In studies using recombinant enzymes, the D243E and T246I mutations shifted the 2093 IC 50 by >170-fold. Structural modeling of Cp MetRS based on an inhibitor-bound Trypanosoma brucei MetRS crystal structure suggested that the resistance mutations reposition nearby hydrophobic residues, interfering with compound binding while minimally impacting substrate binding. This is the first report of naturally emerging Cryptosporidium drug resistance, highlighting the need to address the potential for anticryptosporidial resistance and establish strategies to limit its occurrence. Cryptosporidium is a leading protozoan cause of diarrhea in young children with no reliable treatment. We report results of a dairy calf drug efficacy trial and the spontaneous emergence of drug resistance. Cryptosporidium parvum infected calves initially improved with drug treatment, but infection relapsed in two animals. Parasites shed by each recrudescent calf had mutations in the gene encoding the drug target that altered its amino acid sequence. Recapitulation of the drug target mutations by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing resulted in highly drug-resistant parasites, and recombinant mutant enzymes were resistant to inhibition. This is the first report of naturally emerging Cryptosporidium drug resistance. There is a currently a great opportunity to impact public health with new drugs to treat cryptosporidiosis, and this report highlights the need to address the potential for anticryptosporidial resistance and establish strategies to limit its occurrence in order to realize their full potential.

In each matrix study, five replicates at each of three contamination levels were tested as paired test portions. All 10 matrixes were compared to the appropriate U. S. reference methods under MC-Media Pad ACplus standard-usage conditions (35 ± 1°C for 48 ± 2 h). Across all matrixes, the difference of mean log10 values ranged from -0.43 to 0.44, within the acceptable range of -0.50 to 0.50. The candidate method repeatability SD (sr) varied from 0.03 to 0.23 log10 CFU/g, comparing favorably to the reference method SD, which ranged from 0.06 to 0.30 log10 CFU/g. Seven matrixes were compared to the appropriate U. S. reference methods under MC-Media Pad ACplus rapid-usage conditions (35 ± 1°C for 24 ± 2 h). Of the 21 matrix/concentration combinations, only three instances of difference of mean >0.5 log were observed. The ranges of sr values of the rapid-usage candidate method (0.023-0.324) and the reference method (0.013-0.236) were similar for the seven matrixes tested. All 10 matrixes were compared to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) reference method under MC-Media Pad ACplus alternate-method conditions (30 ± 1°C for 72 ± 3 h). All 10 matrixes yielded a mean difference between methods of <0.5 log, and the ranges of sr values were similar between the candidate alternate method (0.037-0.378) and the ISO reference method (0.037-0.437). The product consistency study demonstrated no significant difference between lots of product and supported the 2-year shelf life. Robustness testing yielded no significant differences when small variations were made in sample volume, incubation temperature, and incubation time. Thus, the data show equivalent or better performance of the MC-Media Pad ACplus method compared to the relevant reference methods in support of AOAC Performance Tested MethodSM certification."

Although only a small subset of illnesses are associated with recognized outbreaks, data from outbreak investigations provide insight into the foods and pathogens that cause illnesses and the settings and conditions in which they occur. 2009-2015 DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FDOSS) collects data on foodborne disease outbreaks, which are defined as the occurrence of two or more cases of a similar illness resulting from the ingestion of a common food. Since the early 1960s, foodborne outbreaks have been reported voluntarily to CDC by state, local, and territorial health departments using a standard form. Beginning in 2009, FDOSS reporting was made through the National Outbreak Reporting System, a web-based platform launched that year. During 2009-2015, FDOSS received reports of 5,760 outbreaks that resulted in 100,939 illnesses, 5,699 hospitalizations, and 145 deaths. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and CDC reported outbreaks. Among 2,953 outbreaks with a single confirmed etiology, norovirus was the most common cause of outbreaks (1,130 outbreaks [38%]) and outbreak-associated illnesses (27,623 illnesses [41%]), followed by Salmonella with 896 outbreaks (30%) and 23,662 illnesses (35%). Outbreaks caused by Listeria, Salmonella, and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) were responsible for 82% of all hospitalizations and 82% of deaths reported. Among 1,281 outbreaks in which the food reported could be classified into a single food category, fish were the most commonly implicated category (222 outbreaks [17%]), followed by dairy (136 [11%]) and chicken (123 [10%]). The food categories responsible for the most outbreak-associated illnesses were chicken (3,114 illnesses [12%]), pork (2,670 [10%]), and seeded vegetables (2,572 [10%]). Multistate outbreaks comprised only 3% of all outbreaks reported but accounted for 11% of illnesses, 34% of hospitalizations, and 54% of deaths. Foodborne disease outbreaks provide information about the pathogens and foods responsible for illness. Norovirus remains the leading cause of foodborne disease outbreaks, highlighting the continued need for food safety improvements targeting worker health and hygiene in food service settings. Outbreaks caused by Listeria, Salmonella, and STEC are important targets for public health intervention efforts, and improving the safety of chicken, pork, and seeded vegetables should be a priority. The causes of foodborne illness should continue to be tracked and analyzed to inform disease prevention policies and initiatives. Strengthening the capacity of state and local health departments to investigate and report outbreaks will assist with these efforts through identification of the foods, etiologies, and settings linked to these outbreaks."

They are found mainly in cereal products and their preparations. In particular, infants and young children who consume cereal products, including porridge and gruel, are exposed to these substances. Objective:The aim of the study is to assess the exposure of infants and young children in Poland to micotoxins (ochratoxin A. deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, fumonisins B1 and B1, T-2 and HT-2 toxins) derived from cereal products intended for infants and children. Material and methods:Samples of products (302) were taken from all over the country in the following three years (2011, 2012 and 2013). HPLC-MS / MS method was used to determine the test compounds. Results:Using the HPLC-MS / MS method, the assessment of population exposure in Poland to mikototoxins (ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, fumonisins B1 and B1, T-2 and HT-2 toxins) derived from cereal products (porridge, gruel) intended for infants and small children. Samples (302) were taken from across the country over the next three years. The exposure values obtained in the average exposure scenario range from 0.2 to 3% compared to the reference toxicological parameters.
Considering that in the case of infants and young children, the tested products constitute a quantitatively significant part of the balanced diet of these consumers, and the remaining groups of foodstuffs, including vegetable products. fruit and meat and dairy products do not contribute significant amounts of mycotoxins to the diet can be accepted. that the level of contamination of cereal products does not pose a significant risk to the health of consumers. In the case of high exposure, it did not exceed 10% of the reference values for deoxynivalenol and the sum of fumonisins B1 and B2. These values were assessed as not relevant for the exposure of infants and young children. In contrast, in the case of zearalenone, the high level of exposure corresponded to 36% of the value of tolerable daily intake (TDI), and for the sum of T-2 and HT-2 toxins, the value of 48% of tolerable daily intake. In both cases, the contribution of pollutants to the diet was significant, but still remained 2-3 times less than the tolerable daily intake. Given, that cereal products are the main source of these contaminants, it can be estimated that exceeding the TDI value in relation to the total diet of infants and young children is unlikely. Conclusions:The exposure values obtained in the average exposure scenario range from 0.2 to 3% compared to the reference toxicological parameters.

Some studies showed that S. aureus strains that infect different host species are genetically distinct, although most strains can infect a wide range of host species. However, there are no clearly defined clonal patterns of S. aureus strains that are known to infect a specific host. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the clonal diversity and virulence characteristics of S. aureus isolates from cases of bovine mastitis. Bacteriological tests were conducted on milk samples from cases of bovine mastitis from 11 dairy farms including some milk samples from unknown farms in Eastern Tennessee. Overall, a total of 111 S. aureus were isolated and identified, and further evaluated for their genetic diversity by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and virulence characteristics by PCR. Genotypic virulence factors including staphylococcal enterotoxins, and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (tsst-1) were tested by PCR. In addition, the association among several known virulence factors of these isolates based on our current and previous studies in our lab were evaluated. Previously generated data that were included in the analysis of association among virulence factors were the presence of biofilm production associated genes in the ica operon such as icaA, icaD and icaAB, and phenotypic virulence characteristics such as hemolysis on blood agar, slime production and resistance or susceptibility to ten commonly used antimicrobials in dairy farms. The PFGE results showed the presence of 16 PFGE types (designated A - P) throughout farms, of which three pulsotypes, I, M and O were the most frequently isolated PFGE types from most farms. The PFGE type M was the most prevalent of all 16 PFGE types, with 64 isolates being present among nine farms. The PCR results of enterotoxin genes showed that out of the total 111 tested 84 (75.7%) were negative whereas 13 (11.7%), 2 (1.8%), 3 (2.7%), 1 (0.9%) and 8 (7.2%) were positive for seb, seb and sec, sec, see, and tsst-1, respectively. All 111 isolates were negative for sea and sej. Results of the evaluation of I, M and O strains adhesion to and invasion into mammary epithelial cells showed that the total count of each strain of bacteria adhered to and invaded into mammary epithelial cell line (MAC-T cells) was not significantly different (P > 0.05). This may be an indication that there is no significant difference in their ability to establish early host-pathogen interaction and colonization of the host. There were no statistically significant associations among PFGE types and other known virulence factors of these strains. However, PFGE types O and M tend to cluster with β-hemolysin, absence of enterotoxins and susceptibility to antimicrobials. In conclusion, there was not any association between pulsotype and genotypic and phenotypic virulence factors. S. aureus isolates from cases of bovine mastitis had diverse genotypes that possessed variable virulence factors."

The increased rate at which antimicrobials are becoming ineffective is a global health risk of increasing concern that threatens withdrawal of beneficial antimicrobials for disease control. The increased demand for food of animal origin, in particular eggs, meat and milk has led to intensification and commercial production systems where excessive use and misuse of antimicrobials may prevail. Antimicrobials, handled and used by farmers and animal attendants with no formal education, may be predisposed to incorrect dosages, misuse, incorrect applications and non-adherence to withdrawal periods. This study was conducted to assess the regulatory roles and governance of antimicrobials, establish the pattern and extent of their use, evaluate the antimicrobial residues and resistance in the food animals and crop agriculture value chains, and relate these findings to existing strategies in place for combating the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in Tanzania. A multimethod approach (desk review, field study and interviews) was used. Relevant establishments were also visited. High levels of resistance to penicillin G, chloramphenicol, streptomycin and oxytetracycline have been reported, especially for Actinobacter pyogenes, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus intermedius and Staphylococcus aureus from dairy cattle with mastitis and in humans. Similar trends were found in poultry where eggs and meat are contaminated with Escherichia coli strains resistant to amoxicillin + clavulanate, sulphamethoxazole and neomycin. An increasing trend of emerging multidrug resistant E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella was also found in food animals. An increase in methicillin resistant Staphlococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in the livestock sector in Tanzania have been reported. The pathogens isolated in animals were resistant to ampicillin, augmentin, gentamicin, co-trimoxazole, tetracycline, amoxicillin, streptomycin, nalidixic acid, azithromycin, chloramphenicol, tylosin, erythromycin, cefuroxime, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. An increased usage of antimicrobials for prophylaxis, and therapeutics against pathogens and for growth promotion in livestock, aquaculture and crop production were observed. A One Health strategic approach is advocated to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the food and agriculture sectors in Tanzania. Practical recommendations include (a) legislation review and implementation; (b) antimicrobial use (AMU), AMR and antimicrobial residue (AR) awareness and advocacy among stakeholders along the value chain; (c) strengthening of surveillance and monitoring programs for AMU, AMR and AR; (d) enhanced development and use of rapid and innovative diagnostic tests and the promotion of biosecurity principles; and (e) good husbandry practices.

One hundred fifty-three samples were positive for S. aureus (53.5%), with an average count of 2.53 log cfu/mL. A total of 679 S. aureus colonies were screened for methicillin resistance by the cefoxitin disk diffusion test, and 104 selected cefoxitin-susceptible isolates were also tested for their susceptibility to other antimicrobials representative of the most relevant classes active against Staphylococcus spp. by using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates, carrying respectively the mecA and the mecC genes, were detected in 2 samples from 2 different farms (prevalence 0.7%). The mecA-positive MRSA isolate was blaZ positive, belonged to spa type t127, sequence type (ST)1, clonal complex (CC)1, carried a staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IVa, and was phenotypically resistant to all the β-lactams tested and to erythromycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and tetracycline. The mecC-positive MRSA isolate was negative for the chromosomally or plasmid-associated blaZ gene but positive for the blaZ allotype associated with SCCmec XI (blaZ-SCCmecXI), belonged to spa type 843, ST(CC)130, carried a SCCmec type XI, and was resistant only to β-lactams. Both MRSA were negative for the presence of specific immune-evasion and virulence genes such as those coding for the Panton-Valentine leucocidin, the toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, and the immune evasion cluster genes. Regarding the presence of the major S. aureus enterotoxin genes, the mecC-positive MRSA tested negative, whereas the ST (CC)1 mecA-positive MRSA harbored the seh gene. Among the 104 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates examined for antimicrobial susceptibility, 63 (60.58%) were susceptible to all the antimicrobials tested, and 41 (39.42%) were resistant to at least 1 antimicrobial. In particular, 23 isolates (22.12%) were resistant to tetracycline, 16 (15.38%) to sulfonomides, 14 (13.46%) to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, and 9 (8.65%) to ampicillin, whereas only 1 isolate was resistant to both fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. The high prevalence of S. aureus found in bulk tank milk samples and the isolation of MRSA, although at a low prevalence, underlines the importance of adopting control measures against S. aureus in dairy sheep farms to minimize the risks for animal and public health. Moreover, this study represents the first report of mecC-positive MRSA isolation in Italy and would confirm that, among livestock animals, sheep might act as a mecC-MRSA reservoir. Although this lineage seems to be rare in dairy sheep (0.35% of farms tested), because mecC-positive MRSA are difficult to detect by diagnostic routine methods employed for mecA-positive livestock-associated MRSA, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of the importance of searching for the mecC gene in all the mecA-negative S. aureus isolates displaying resistance to oxacillin, cefoxitin, or both."

{'dairy cattle': ['L. monocytogenes']}</s>","Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) is frequently detected in ruminants, especially dairy cattle, and associated with the sporadic and epidemic outbreak of listeriosis in farms. In this epidemiological study, the prevalence, virulence, antibiotic resistance profiles, and genetic diversity of L. monocytogenes in three Egyptian dairy cattle farms were investigated. The risk factors associated with the fecal shedding of L. monocytogenes were analyzed. The L. monocytogenes strains from the three farms were categorized into distinct genotypes based on sampling site and sample type through enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR). A total of 1896 samples were collected from animals, environments, and milking equipment in the three farms. Results revealed that 137 (7.23%) of these samples were L. monocytogenes positive. The prevalence of L. monocytogenes in the animal samples was high (32.1%), and the main environmental source of prevalent genotypes in the three farms was silage. For all sample types, L. monocytogenes was more prevalent in farm I than in farms II and III. Risk factor analysis showed seasonal variation in production hygiene. For all sample types, L. monocytogenes was significantly more prevalent in winter than in spring and summer. The level of L. monocytogenes fecal shedding was high likely because of increasing age, number of parities, and milk yield in dairy cattle. Two virulence genes, namely, hlyA & prfA, were also detected in 93 strains, whereas only one of these genes was found in 44 residual strains. Conversely, iap was completely absent in all strains. The strains exhibited phenotypic resistance to most of the tested antibiotics, but none of them was resistant to netilmicin or vancomycin. According to sample type, the strains from the animal samples were extremely resistant to amoxicillin (95.2%, 80/84) and cloxacillin (92.9%, 78/84). By comparison, the strains from the environmental samples were highly resistant to cefotaxime (86.95%, 20/23). Furthermore, 25 multi-antibiotic resistance (MAR) patterns were observed in L. monocytogenes strains. All strains had a MAR index of 0.22-0.78 and harbored antibiotic resistance genes, including extended-spectrum β-lactamase (blaCTX-M [92.7%] and blaDHA-1 [66.4%]), quinolones (qnrS [91.2%], qnrA [58.4%], parC [58.4%], and qnrB [51%]), macrolides (erm[B] [76.6%], erm(C) [1.5%], and msr(A) [27%]), trimethoprim (dfrD [65.7%]), and tetracyclines (tet(M) [41.6%], tet(S) [8%], and int-Tn [26.3%]). ERIC-PCR confirmed that the strains were genetically diverse and heterogeneous. A total of 137 isolated L. monocytogenes strains were classified into 22 distinct ERIC-PCR groups (A-V). Among them, ERIC E (10.2%) was the most prevalent group. These results indicated that environment and milking equipment served as reservoirs and potential transmission ways of virulent and multidrug-resistant L. monocytogenes to dairy animals, consequently posing threats to public health. Silage is the main environmental source of prevalent genotypes on all three farms. Therefore, hygienic measures at the farm level should be developed and implemented to reduce L. monocytogenes transmission inside dairy cattle farms."

Therefore, the function identify_safety_hazards() returns an empty dictionary.</s>","The Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the OIE (World organisation for animal health) (the Terrestrial Code) makes recommendations for international movements of live animals and animal products because of a possible generic risk of foot and mouth disease (FMD) for these different commodities. For instance, international movement of vaccinated live animals or products of such animals is restricted due to the possible masking of clinical disease as a result of vaccination and to the perceived risk of persistently infected animals among vaccinated livestock. In addition, bilateral agreements between exporting and importing countries on the importation of animal products can be based on the 'equivalence' of the animal health conditions in both countries, or on formal or informal risk assessments in accordance with the norms and recommendations of the Terrestrial Code. In this regard, an exporting country may be required to prepare a complete and transparent document describing the animal health situation, including the factors required to assess the risk involved. Furthermore, expert committees of importing countries regularly evaluate and verify these conditions in exporting countries. The level of confidence in the information obtained by the expert committee can then be entered into the risk analysis equation. An important FMD risk reduction factor for the importation of animals and animal products is early recognition of the disease at the source of the commodity by alert stakeholders, such as official and private veterinarians and the chain of the livestock industry. This is true for all countries irrespective of their vaccination status. The risk posed by the importation of vaccinated animals becomes negligible when an adequate protocol--in compliance with the norms and recommendations of the Terrestrial Code--is applied. However, recently, export of live animals from countries that do not practise vaccination has also proven to pose a significant risk and the rules governing such transport may have to be reviewed. Disease surveillance, biosecurity at the farm level, traceability and control of the source cattle and slaughterhouse inspections are the main risk reduction measures for meat and meat products from vaccinated cattle. If these animals are slaughtered and processed under good management practice--in accordance with the norms and recommendations of the Terrestrial Code--these products present a negligible risk for the introduction of FMD. Risk reduction by maturation and deboning is an important procedure, but is probably overemphasised. Mechanical contamination of cattle carcasses with 'carrier virus' from the pharyngeal area during slaughter and processing is very unlikely. Risk assessments showed that the importation of milk products from countries or zones that practise vaccination of dairy herds poses a negligible risk. Risk assessments also demonstrated that the importation of bovine embryos from vaccinated cows--in accordance with the norms and recommendations of the Terrestrial Code--poses a negligible risk. Likewise, the risk from the importation of semen from vaccinated bulls is also negligible when an adequate test protocol is applied in accordance with the Terrestrial Code."

            Dictionary: None</s>",{'Ammonia': ['Human health via consumption of the food']}</s>,"Ammonia emitted from animal feeding operations is an environmental and human health hazard, contributing to eutrophication of surface waters and nitrate contamination of ground waters, soil acidity, and fine particulate matter formation. It may also contribute to global warming through nitrous oxide formation. Along with these societal concerns, ammonia emission is a net loss of manure fertilizer value to the producer. A significant portion of cattle manure nitrogen, primarily from urinary urea, is converted to ammonium and eventually lost to the atmosphere as ammonia. Determining ammonia emissions from cattle operations is complicated by the multifaceted nature of the factors regulating ammonia volatilization, such as manure management, ambient temperature, wind speed, and manure composition and pH. Approaches to quantify ammonia emissions include micrometeorological methods, mass balance accounting and enclosures. Each method has its advantages, disadvantages and appropriate application. It is also of interest to determine the ammonia emitting potential of manure (AEP) independent of environmental factors. The ratio of nitrogen to non-volatile minerals (phosphorus, potassium, ash) or nitrogen isotopes ratio in manure has been suggested as a useful indicator of AEP. Existing data on ammonia emission factors and flux rates are extremely variable. For dairy farms, emission factors from 0.82 to 250 g ammonia per cow per day have been reported, with an average of 59 g per cow per day (n = 31). Ammonia flux rates for dairy farms averaged 1.03 g m-2 h-1 (n = 24). Ammonia losses are significantly greater from beef feedlots, where emission factors average 119 g per animal per day (n = 9) with values as high as 280 g per animal per day. Ammonia flux rate for beef feedlots averaged 0.174 g m-2 h-1 (n = 12). Using nitrogen mass balance approaches, daily ammonia nitrogen losses of 25 to 50% of the nitrogen excreted in manure have been estimated for dairy cows and feedlot cattle. Practices to mitigate ammonia emissions include reducing excreted N (particularly urinary N), acidifying ammonia sources, or binding ammonium to a substrate. Reducing crude protein concentration in cattle diets and ruminal protein degradability are powerful tools for reducing N excretion, AEP, and whole-farm ammonia emissions. Reducing dietary protein can also benefit the producer by reducing feed cost. These interventions, however, have to be balanced with the risk of lost production. Manure treatment techniques that reduce volatile N species (e. g. , urease inhibition, pH reduction, nitrification-denitrification) are also effective for mitigating ammonia emissions. Another option for reducing ammonia emissions is capture and treatment of released ammonia. Examples in the latter category include biofilters, permeable and impermeable covers, and manure incorporation into the soil for crop or pasture production. Process-level simulation of ammonia formation and emission provides a useful tool for estimating emissions over a wide range of production practices and evaluating the potential benefits of mitigation strategies. Reducing ammonia emissions from dairy and beef cattle operations is critical to achieving environmentally sustainable animal production that will benefit producers and society at large."

}</s>","Staphylococcus aureus is one of the major pathogens causing mastitis in dairy herds. The colonization of dairy cows and subsequent contamination of raw milk by S. aureus, especially strains exhibiting multidrug resistance and biofilm-forming and toxin-producing abilities, remains an important issue for both dairy farmers and public health. In this study, we investigated the prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility, biofilm formation, and genetic diversity of S. aureus from subclinical bovine mastitis in dairy farms located in southern Xinjiang, China. Sixty-five isolates from 84 subclinical mastitic milk samples were identified as S. aureus. The resistance rates to penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, linezolid, rifampicin, quinupudin-dafupudin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and chloramphenicol were 58.5, 44.6, 40.0, 18.5, 12.3, 10.8, 9.2, 6.2, 4.6, 4.6, and 1.5%, respectively. All isolates were susceptible to cefoxitin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. Isolates from farm A showed a significantly higher resistance rate to tetracycline (16.9%) than those from farm B (1.5%). The most frequently detected virulence factors were hla (96.9%, 63/65) and hlb (100.0%, 65/65). The percentage rates of the staphylococcal enterotoxin genes sea, sec, sed, seg, seh, sei, and sej in S. aureus isolates were 4.6, 33.8, 27.7, 3.1, 41.5, 41.5, and 7.7%, respectively. The percentage rate of the sec gene in isolates from farm B (30.8%) was significantly higher than that of farm A (3.1%). The percentage rates of the tsst and pvl genes in S. aureus isolates were 26.2 and 40.0%. The percentage rate of the pvl gene in isolates from farm B (32.3%) was significantly higher than that of farm A (7.7%). The adhesion molecules fnbA, fnbB, clfA, clfB, and cna were detected in 21 (32.3%), 23 (35.4%), 65 (100.0%), 65 (100.0%), and 65 (100.0%) isolates, respectively. The percentage rates of the icaA, sarA, tcaR, ccp, luxS, and sigB genes in S. aureus isolates were 69.2, 100.0, 86.2, 95.4, 84.6, and 100.0%, respectively. The fnbB and icaA genes were more frequently detected in isolates from farm A (29.2 and 40.0%, respectively) than those from farm B (6.2 and 29.2%, respectively). The luxS gene was more often found in isolates from farm B (50.8%) than those from farm A (33.8%). Using the microplate method, 61.5, 26.2, and 10.8% of the isolates showed weak, moderate, and strong biofilm-forming abilities, respectively. Different clonal complex (CC) and spa-types were identified, including CC81, CC398, CC88, CC5405, and CC5406. Importantly, in this study we report for the first time 41 new sequence types (ST) among 44 distinct ST. These results indicated high genetic diversity of S. aureus involved in subclinical bovine mastitis in southern Xinjiang, China. The results also showed that S. aureus from subclinical bovine mastitis cases in southern Xinjiang, China, were mainly resistant to β-lactams, erythromycin, and clindamycin. Also, biofilm- and adhesion-related genes, which are increasingly known as important virulence factors in the pathogenesis of S. aureus infections, were detected at a high rate. This study could help identify predominant clones and provide surveillance measures to decrease or eliminate S. aureus contamination in raw milk of dairy cows with subclinical mastitis."

Antibiotics such as penicillin, cephalosporin, streptomycin, and tetracycline are used for the treatment and prevention of diseases affecting dairy cows caused by a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Antibiotics are often administrated routinely to entire herds to prevent mastitis during the dry period. An increase in the incidence of disease in a herd generally results in increased use of antimicrobials, which in turn increases the potential for antibiotic residues in milk and the potential for increased bacterial resistance to antimicrobials. Continued use of antibiotics in the treatment and prevention of diseases of dairy cows will continue to be scrutinized. It is clear that strategies employing the prudent use of antimicrobials are needed. This clearly illustrates the importance of effective herd disease prevention and control programs. Based on studies published to date, scientific evidence does not support widespread, emerging resistance among mastitis pathogens to antibacterial drugs even though many of these antibiotics have been used in the dairy industry for treatment and prevention of disease for several decades. However, it is clear that use of antibiotics in dairy cows can contribute to increased antimicrobial resistance. While antimicrobial resistance does occur, we are of the opinion that the advantages of using antibiotics for the treatment of mastitis far outweigh the disadvantages. The clinical consequences of antimicrobial resistance of dairy pathogens affecting humans appear small. Antimicrobial resistance among dairy pathogens, particularly those found in milk, is likely not a human health concern as long as the milk is pasteurized. However, there are an increasing number of people who choose to consume raw milk. Transmission of an antimicrobial-resistant mastitis pathogen and/or foodborne pathogen to humans could occur if contaminated unpasteurized milk is consumed, which is another important reason why people should not consume raw milk. Likewise, resistant bacteria contaminating meat from dairy cows should not be a significant human health concern if the meat is cooked properly. Prudent use of antibiotics in the dairy industry is important, worthwhile, and necessary. Use of antibiotics at times when animals are susceptible to new infection such as the dry period is a sound management decision and a prudent use of antibiotics on the farm. Strategies involving prudent use of antibiotics for treatment encompass identification of the pathogen causing the infection, determining the susceptibility/resistance of the pathogen to assess the most appropriate antibiotic to use for treatment, and a sufficient treatment duration to ensure effective concentrations of the antibiotic to eliminate the pathogen. As the debate on the use of antibiotics in animal agriculture continues, we need to consider the consequences of, “What would happen if antibiotics are banned for use in the dairy industry and in other food-producing animals?” The implications of this question are far reaching and include such aspects as animal welfare, health, and well-being and impacts on food quantity, quality, and food costs. This question should be an important aspect in this ongoing and controversial debate!"

Using peer-reviewed literature published up to 2018, this review surveyed and compiled the available and reported data on the concentrations and distributions of 30 OPEs based on their occurrence in various food samples from around the world. Regardless of sampling locations or food categories, 22 OPEs were detectable in at least one of analyzed sample, and there were clear variations in OPE levels among samples from different locations or food categories. For instance, cereals and fats/oils were the most contaminated by OPEs in China and Belgium, whereas fats/oils and desserts were the main polluted products in Sweden. In contrast, vegetables, fruits, fluid dairy products, and cereals were reported as the primary categories of food polluted by OPEs in Australia. Animal-based food categories such as eggs, fish and meat were the least contaminated, whereas the highest median OPE concentrations were found in meat and fish from the United State. The levels and distribution patterns of OPEs in foodstuffs demonstrated a tremendous difference even when collected from the same country and the same food item. Rice from China had the highest tris(2‑chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP, mean: 29.8 ng/g dw) levels, whereas 2‑ethylhexyl‑diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP, mean: 4.17 ng/g ww), triphenyl phosphate (TPHP, mean: 26.14 ng/g ww), tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP, mean: 0.87 ng/g ww) and tributyl phosphate (TNBP, median: 0.55 ng/g ww) concentrations were the highest in the same food category from Sweden, Belgium, Australia, and the United States, respectively. These discrepancies may be due to a variety of reasons such as differences in OPE physico-chemical properties, extent of usage, uptake, metabolic pathways, industrial food manufacturing processes, OPE level differences as a function of habitat, and accumulation and degradability of OPEs in different species. It is worth noting that, due to its worldwide usage in food packaging materials, EHDPP was more prominently found in processed food compared to non-processed food. Based on reported OPE levels in various foods, this review conducted a preliminary assessment of human exposure to OPEs through dietary intake, which suggested that the OPE estimated daily intake (EDI) for humans was around 880 ng/kg bw/day (95th percentile). This value was well below the corresponding OPE health reference dose given by the U. S. EPA (≥15,000 ng/kg bw/day). Even so, dietary exposure to OPEs via food intake may be not negligible based on some important factors such as dilution effects, cooking processes, and the contribution of as yet unknown means of OPE exposure. Overall, this review highlights several gaps in our understanding of OPEs in foodstuffs: 1) the investigation of contamination levels of OPEs in foodstuffs should be extended to other regions, especially North America and European countries, where OPEs are widely used and frequently detected in environmental samples, and 2) newly identified OPE derivatives/by-products, e. g. , OP diesters and hydroxylated metabolites, which have been reported as end-products of OPE enzymatic metabolism or degradation through aqueous hydrolysis, and which may co-exist with parent OPEs, could also be screened with precursor OPEs in foodstuffs in future studies."

This led to the evaluation of safety measures with regard to dioxin intake from food. Important aspects regarding dioxins and PCBs in the food chain are reviewed here, allowing a contextual understanding of the present situation through its chronological developments. About 90-98% of the average exposure of humans to dioxins and PCBs results from dietary intake, with food of animal origin being the predominant source. Therefore, animal feed contributes considerably to the presence of these compounds in food. The detection of the ""real"" source of a contamination event in the food chain is a complex scientific problem and requires specific knowledge on production processes and changes of patterns during bioaccumulation. This is demonstrated by complex investigations performed in three studies on two continents to identify the source (e. g. from contamination of cow's milk in Germany, to citrus pulp pellets from Brazil as an ingredient in feed, then to contaminated lime for neutralization and finally to a landfill with residues of vinyl chloride monomer production). This example shows also the substantial economic losses resulting from incidents in the food chain and the consequences to global trade. In 2001, the EU Scientific Committee on Food established a group tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 14 pg WHO-TEQ/kg body weight and concluded that a considerable proportion of the European population would exceed this TWI. On the global level, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) provides scientific advice to the Codex Alimentarius Commission and therefore contributes to harmonized international food standards. In its evaluation of 2001, JECFA derived a provisional tolerable monthly intake (PTMI) of 70 pg TEQ/kg body weight. The sum of the median intake of PCDD/F-TEQ and PCB-TEQ exceeded the PTMI in Western European countries, was in the PTMI range in North America, but lower in Japan and New Zealand. The 90th percentile of PCDD/F-TEQ exceeded the PTMI in Western European countries and North America, the 90th percentile of coplanar PCBs in Western European countries. Therefore, in 2001 the EU Commission developed a strategy to reduce the presence of dioxins and PCBs in the environment and in the food chain. The legislative measures comprised maximum levels and action levels for feed and food, and a Rapid Alert System for detected incidents was introduced. The network of the EU Reference Laboratory and National Reference Laboratories contributes to harmonization within the EU Member States and developed analytical criteria for screening and confirmatory methods for control of feed and food. After all these efforts it is of general interest to see whether these measures had an effect. The 2012 evaluation of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) based on comprehensive monitoring data of 26 European countries shows a general decrease in dietary exposure of dioxins and DL-PCBs between 2002-2004 and 2008-2010, estimated to be between 16.6% and 79.3% for the different population groups. A smaller decrease was observed for NDL-PCBs. The percentage of individuals exposed above the TWI of 14 pg TEQ/kg b. w. was estimated to be between 1.0 and 52.9%. Toddlers and other children were the most exposed groups (being at the upper end of these ranges). Fish, meat and dairy products appeared to be the highest contributing food groups to dietary exposure."

In this context, Foodomics emerged as a novel scientific discipline studying food and nutrition domains through the application of advanced omics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and/or metabolomics. Above-mentioned technologies have been used in an integrated, holistic way to study foods for: i) compound profiling, authenticity, and/or biomarker-detection related to product quality or safety; ii) contaminants and their whole toxicity; iii) bioactivity and general effects on human health; iv) their digestion and assumption in human body; v) development of new transgenic products; and vi) evaluation of their modifications within the digestive tract. In the first context, a highly reproducible MALDI-TOF-MS polypeptide profiling procedure is here presented, which provides information on buffalo milk quality through the identification of specific markers of its freshness. Among identified markers, some were indicative of the action of various proteolytic enzymes and the resulting occurrence of specific defense components in buffalo milk having the physiological role to limit bacterial/virus content in this biological fluid.

Results and discussion. In total, for 2017-2019, 258 samples of pasteurized drinking milk were studied, of which 11 samples did not meet the requirements of regulatory documents on physical-chemical and organoleptic quality indicators. In 11 rejected samples, the mass fraction of protein was underestimated by 25-50%, the DSMR by 8-13%, the density by 1-2%. In all inappropriate samples, deviations were established in the fatty acid composition of cow's milk fat and the proportion of vegetable fats in the fat phase (the proportion of phytosterols in the total sterol content). Increased acidity was detected in 1 sample. For one sample, the excess of the permissible negative deviation of the net content from the nominal quantity was determined. Thus, over three years, the share of products that do not meet the requirements of regulatory documents in terms of quality indicators, identified during laboratory tests, amounted to 4.3%. There were no inconsistencies with the regulatory requirements regarding the presence of phosphatase, purity group, the presence of starch, soda and preservatives.

Nevertheless, DDT and several other organochlorine insecticides are still being used for agriculture and public health programs in developing countries in Asia and the South Pacific. As a consequence, humans in this region are exposed to greater dietary levels of organochlorines. In this review, published information on organochlorine concentrations in foodstuffs from South and Southeast Asia and Oceanic countries has been compiled. Foodstuffs that contribute to human exposures and dietary intakes of organochlorines were examined, and the data compared with those reported from more developed nations. Among various developing countries in Asia, considerable information on organochlorines in foodstuffs has been available from India since the late 1960s. DDT and HCH were the major insecticides in Indian foodstuffs. Concentrations of these insecticides have declined more than two orders of magnitude in farm products, such as food grains and vegetables, in two decades. Milk and milk products are the major sources of dietary exposure to DDT and HCH in India. The residues of these insecticides in dairy products were close to or above the MRLs of the FAO/WHO. Dietary intake of DDT and HCH by Indians was > 100 fold that in more developed nations. Sporadic incidences of greater concentrations (> 1 microgram/g) of aldrin, dieldrin, and heptachlor have been measured in Indian vegetables. Untreated surface waters could be a potential source of DDT and HCH exposure. In most Southeast Asian countries DDT was the common contaminant in animal origin foodstuffs. The higher percentage of p,p'-DDT in meat and fish from Southeast Asian countries, except Japan and Korea, indicated the recent use of DDt in vector control operations. Dietary intakes of DDt and HCH in Southeast Asia were an order of magnitude less than those of Indians but 5- to 10 fold greater than in more developed nations. In addition to DDT, aldrin and dieldrin were prominent in meat collected from Thailand and Malaysia. Aquatic food products from more industrialized countries, such as Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, contained significant levels of PCBs. In South Pacific countries, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, chlordanes and PCBs were the most prevalent organochlorines in foodstuffs. Food contamination by DDT, HCH, aldrin, and dieldrin was less than in developing countries in Asia but greater than in the U. S. and Japan. Intake of PCBs in Australia was greater than in the U. S. Meat and fish were the major sources of organochlorine exposure by Australians. Human dietary intake of organochlorines has been declining more slowly in developing countries in Asia. Current intakes were at least 5- to 100 fold greater than those in more developed nations, suggesting a greater risk from organochlorine exposure. Factors such as malnutrition, common among rural poor in developing nations, can increase these risks. Of greatest concern is the magnitude of exposure to organochlorines to which infants and children are subjected through human and dairy milk. The estimated intake of DDT by infants was at least 100 fold greater than the ADI of the FAO/WHO. In addition to DDT, excessive exposures to HCH and dieldrin may cause potential health effects in infants because they are more vulnerable to toxic effects. The design and implementation of appropriate epidemiological studies and their integration with monitoring of human, food, and environmental samples would be a major step in assessing the risks of organochlorine residues in foods and controlling or eliminating them. With the continued globalization of trade in food products, and the concomitant risk that food contaminated through point-source pollution may be widely distributed, identification of sources and their control should be matters of"

In this study, a multi-residue method was developed for the simultaneous determination of 45 hormones in EBNs, including estrogens, progesterones, androgens, and cortical hormones. EBN samples (1.0 g) were weighed into 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes and mixed with 8 mL of pure water. Then, the samples were extracted twice with 15 mL of acetonitrile and ethyl acetate (1∶1, v/v) under ultrasonic-assisted conditions for 30 min, and the protein in the EBN samples was precipitated at 4000 r/min for 5 min. The clear supernatants were loaded onto a hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced (HLB) SPE column, which was previously activated with methanol (3 mL) followed by pure water (3 mL). The cartridge was washed with 3 mL of pure water and 3 mL of 50% methanol aqueous solution. The hormones were eluted with 3 mL of methanol. A rapid analysis was performed using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The hormones in the extracting solution were separated on a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 column (100 mm×2.1 mm, 2.6 μm) and eluted by gradient elution with acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid aqueous solution (ESI+) or acetonitrile-water (ESI-).

The HPLC-MS/MS results showed good linearity in the range of 0.20-20.0 μg/L with correlation coefficients (R2) ≥0.9990. For the 45 hormones, the limits of detection (LODs, S/N≥3) were 0.04-0.70 μg/kg and the limits of quantification (LOQs, S/N≥10) were 0.16-2.00 μg/kg. The recoveries of five hormones, namely, fluorometholone, budesonide, aldosterone, fluocinonide, and ethinylestradiol, were 40.2%-63.6%. Owing to the low recoveries, this method might be suitable only for qualitative testing of the five hormones. The recoveries of the other 40 target analytes were between 72.2% and 112.3% at spiked levels of 2.0, 4.0, and 20.0 μg/kg with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 2.5%-11.6%. The method is characterized by easy operation, rapidness, high precision, and high sensitivity for the 40 compounds. Thus, this method is suitable for determination of the 40 hormones from EBNs for qualitative testing and quantitation. The proposed method was used to analyze 1021 EBN samples from Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam from 2017 to 2021. Only three hormones, progesterone, boldenone, and androstenedione, were identified in the EBN samples, while the levels of the other hormones were lower than their individual LODs. The detected rates of progesterone, boldenone, and androstenedione were 100%, 79%, and 89%, respectively. The contents of progesterone, boldenone, and androstenedione in the EBN samples were 0.097-3.58 μg/kg, 0-0.096 μg/kg and 0-1.77 μg/kg, respectively. The levels of hormones in EBNs were compared with those in eggs, pure milk, and dairy products, which were also animal-derived foods. Androstenedione was detected in all egg samples monitored, and its content was higher than that in EBN samples, pure milk, and dairy products. The content of boldenone was similar among the four products investigated in this study. Based on risk assessment using progesterone, the dietary intake was found to be 3.54 μg/d from milk >1.09 μg/d from eggs >0.0030 μg/d from EBNs. The results showed that the levels of hormones in EBNs were much lower than those in eggs, milk, and dairy products for daily consumption. Based on this investigation, the health effect of the hormones in EBNs may be insignificant."

Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are a threat to food safety because they may harbor multiple enterotoxins and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. CNS bacteria are an emerging nosocomial pathogen in public health. CNS also cause bovine mastitis with a significant economic loss in the dairy industry and may introduce toxins to the food supply chain resulting in foodborne illnesses. However, information on CNS and their AMR status are scarce in food animal production and processing lines in Ethiopia. This cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence and AMR patterns of CNS in dairy farms and abattoirs using samples (n = 1001) from udder milk, beef carcass, personnel, and different abattoir and dairy equipment across five locations of central Oromia. The CNS isolates were identified via standard microbiological protocols and evaluated using disc diffusion test against 14 antimicrobials belonging to nine different broad classes. Uni-and-multivariable logistic regressions were used to analyze the association between potential risk factors (location, sample source, and sample type) and positivity to CNS. The overall prevalence of CNS in the five different geographic locations studied was 9.6% (range: 6.7-12.4%) and varied between abattoirs (11.3%) and dairy farms (8.0%). CNS were prevalent on the carcass, milk, equipment, personnel hands, and nasal samples. Of all CNS isolates, 7.1, 10.7, 7.1, 12.5, 17.9, 10.7, 12.5, 7.1, 1.8, 5.4, 1.8, and 5.4% exhibited AMR simultaneously to single, double, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 antimicrobials, respectively. Overall, the isolates displayed 51 different AMR phenotypic patterns in which 50% of the isolates exhibited quadruple-resistance simultaneously based on the nine broad antimicrobial classes tested using 14 representative antimicrobials. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) CNS (i. e. ≥ 3 classes of antimicrobials) was significantly (p = 0.037) different between locations with 100, 57.1, 50, 86.7, and 76.9% in Addis Ababa, Adama, Assela, Bishoftu, and Holeta, respectively. However, the prevalence of MDR CNS was not significantly (p = 0.20) different between dairy farms (87.5%) and abattoirs (71.9%). We evaluated the effect of acquiring cefoxitin-resistance of the isolates on the efficacy (i. e. inhibition zone) of the rest antimicrobials using General Linear Model after adjusting geographical locations as a random effect. Isolates with cefoxitin-resistance significantly displayed resistance to eight antimicrobials of 14 tested including amoxicillin, penicillin, cloxacillin, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, and tetracycline (p = 0.000), and erythromycin (p = 0.02). On the other hand, cefoxitin-resistant isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, streptomycin, and sulphamethoxazone trimethoprim (p = 0.000). Thus, antimicrobials such as gentamicin and ciprofloxacin may be an alternative therapy to treat cefoxitin-resistant CNS, as 96.4% of CNS isolates were susceptible to these antimicrobials. Overall, 94.1 and 54.5% of the CNS isolates among cefoxitin-resistant and cefoxitin-susceptible, respectively, harbored resistance to 3 or more classes of antimicrobials i. e. MDR. The overall prevalence of CNS in milk, meat, equipment, and food handlers in central Oromia was 9.6% but varied by location and sample source. Some specific niches such as equipment, hands, and nasal cavities of personnel are significant sites for the source of CNS. Most, but not all, MDR CNS isolates were cefoxitin-resistant. Overall, 78.6% of the CNS tested were MDR and 50% had resistance to four or more broad classes of antimicrobials. CNS in food animals (raw milk and meat), equipment, and food handlers can be the source of MDR to the public. Personnel safety and hygienic food handling practices are needed. In addition, further investigation into the risk factors for the transmission and mechanisms of resistance of the CNS is required for intervention."

A vertically integrated foodservice restaurant agreed to work with IFT to secure data from its supply chain for both a multi-ingredient and a simpler product. Potential multi-ingredient products considered included canned tuna, supreme pizza, and beef tacos. IFT ensured that all supply-chain data collected did not include any proprietary information or information that would otherwise identify the supply-chain partner who provided the information prior to sharing this information with product tracing technology providers. The 9 traceability solution providers who agreed to participate in this project have their systems deployed in a wide range of sectors within the food industry including, but not limited to, livestock, dairy, produce, fruits, seafood, meat, and pork; as well as in pharmaceutical, automotive, retail, and other industries. Some have also been implemented across the globe including Canada, China, USA, Norway, and the EU, among others. This broad commercial use ensures that the findings of this work are applicable to a broad spectrum of the food system. Six of the 9 participants successfully completed the data entry phase of this test. To verify successful data entry for these 6, a demo or screenshots of the data set from each system's user interface was requested. Only 4 of the 6 were able to provide us with this evidence for verification. Of the 6 that completed data entry and moved on to the scenarios phase of the test, 5 were able to provide us with the responses to the scenarios. Time metrics were useful for evaluating the scalability and usability of each technology. Scalability was derived from the time it took to enter the nonstandardized data set into the system (ranges from 7 to 11 d). Usability was derived from the time it took to query the scenarios and provide the results (from a few hours to a week). The time was measured in days it took for the participants to respond after we supplied them all the information they would need to successfully execute each test/scenario. Two of the technology solution providers successfully implemented and participated in a proof-of-concept interoperable framework during Year 2 of this study. While not required, they also demonstrated this interoperability capability on the FSMA-mandated food product tracing pilots for the U. S. FDA. This has significant real-world impact since the demonstration of interoperability enables U. S. FDA to obtain evidence on the importance and impact of data-sharing moving forward. Another real-world accomplishment is the modification or upgrade of commercial technology solutions to enhance or implement interoperability. As these systems get deployed by clients in the food industry, interoperability will no longer be an afterthought but will be built into their traceability systems. In turn, industry and regulators will better understand the capabilities of the currently available technologies, and the technology provider community will identify ways in which their systems may be further developed to increase interoperability and utility."

","In this report the various elements of the safety and nutritional assessment procedure for genetically modified (GM) plant derived food and feed are discussed, in particular the potential and limitations of animal feeding trials for the safety and nutritional testing of whole GM food and feed. The general principles for the risk assessment of GM plants and derived food and feed are followed, as described in the EFSA guidance document of the EFSA Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms. In Section 1 the mandate, scope and general principles for risk assessment of GM plant derived food and feed are discussed. Products under consideration are food and feed derived from GM plants, such as maize, soybeans, oilseed rape and cotton, modified through the introduction of one or more genes coding for agronomic input traits like herbicide tolerance and/or insect resistance. Furthermore GM plant derived food and feed, which have been obtained through extensive genetic modifications targeted at specific alterations of metabolic pathways leading to improved nutritional and/or health characteristics, such as rice containing beta-carotene, soybeans with enhanced oleic acid content, or tomato with increased concentration of flavonoids, are considered. The safety assessment of GM plants and derived food and feed follows a comparative approach, i. e. the food and feed are compared with their non-GM counterparts in order to identify intended and unintended (unexpected) differences which subsequently are assessed with respect to their potential impact on the environment, safety for humans and animals, and nutritional quality. Key elements of the assessment procedure are the molecular, compositional, phenotypic and agronomic analysis in order to identify similarities and differences between the GM plant and its near isogenic counterpart. The safety assessment is focussed on (i) the presence and characteristics of newly expressed proteins and other new constituents and possible changes in the level of natural constituents beyond normal variation, and on the characteristics of the GM food and feed, and (ii) the possible occurrence of unintended (unexpected) effects in GM plants due to genetic modification. In order to identify these effects a comparative phenotypic and molecular analysis of the GM plant and its near isogenic counterpart is carried out, in parallel with a targeted analysis of single specific compounds, which represent important metabolic pathways in the plant like macro and micro nutrients, known anti-nutrients and toxins. Significant differences may be indicative of the occurrence of unintended effects, which require further investigation. Section 2 provides an overview of studies performed for the safety and nutritional assessment of whole food and feed. Extensive experience has been built up in recent decades from the safety and nutritional testing in animals of irradiated foods, novel foods and fruit and vegetables. These approaches are also relevant for the safety and nutritional testing of whole GM food and feed. Many feeding trials have been reported in which GM foods like maize, potatoes, rice, soybeans and tomatoes have been fed to rats or mice for prolonged periods, and parameters such as body weight, feed consumption, blood chemistry, organ weights, histopathology etc have been measured. The food and feed under investigation were derived from GM plants with improved agronomic characteristics like herbicide tolerance and/or insect resistance. The majority of these experiments did not indicate clinical effects or histopathological abnormalities in organs or tissues of exposed animals. In some cases adverse effects were noted, which were difficult to interpret due to shortcomings in the studies. Many studies have also been carried out with feed derived from GM plants with agronomic input traits in target animal species to assess the nutritive value of the feed and their performance potential. Studies in sheep, pigs, broilers, lactating dairy cows, and fish, comparing the in vivo bioavailability of nutrients from a range of GM plants with their near isogenic counterpart and commercial varieties, showed that they were comparable with those for near isogenic non-GM lines and commercial varieties. In Section 3 toxicological in vivo, in silico, and in vitro test methods are discussed which may be applied for the safety and nutritional assessment of specific compounds present in food and feed or of whole food and feed derived from GM plants. Moreover the purpose, potential and limitations of the 90-day rodent feeding trial for the safety and nutritional testing of whole food and feed have been examined. Methods for single and repeated dose toxicity testing, reproductive and developmental toxicity testing and immunotoxicity testing, as described in OECD guideline tests for single well-defined chemicals are discussed and considered to be adequate for the safety testing of single substances including new products in GM food and feed. Various in silico and in vitro methods may contribute to the safety assessment of GM plant derived food and feed and components thereof, like (i) in silico searches for sequence homology and/or structural similarity of novel proteins or their degradation products to known toxic or allergenic proteins, (ii) simulated gastric and intestinal fluids in order to study the digestive stability of newly expressed proteins and in vitro systems for analysis of the stability of the novel protein under heat or other processing conditions, and (iii) in vitro genotoxicity test methods that screen for point mutations, chromosomal aberrations and DNA damage/repair. The current performance of the safety assessment of whole foods is mainly based on the protocols for low-molecular-weight chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, pesticides, food additives and contaminants. However without adaptation, these protocols have limitations for testing of whole food and feed. This primarily results from the fact that defined single substances can be dosed to laboratory animals at very large multiples of the expected human exposure, thus giving a large margin of safety. In contrast foodstuffs are bulky, lead to satiation and can only be included in the diet at much lower multiples of expected human intakes. When testing whole foods, the possible highest concentration of the GM food and feed in the laboratory animal diet may be limited because of nutritional imbalance of the diet, or by the presence of compounds with a known toxicological profile. The aim of the 90-days rodent feeding study with the whole GM food and feed is to assess potential unintended effects of toxicological and/or nutritional relevance and to establish whether the GM food and feed is as safe and nutritious as its traditional comparator rather than determining qualitative and quantitative intrinsic toxicity of defined food constituents. The design of the study should be adapted from the OECD 90-day rodent toxicity study. The precise study design has to take into account the nature of the food and feed and the characteristics of the new trait(s) and their intended role in the GM food and feed. A 90-day animal feeding trial has a large capacity (sensitivity and specificity) to detect potential toxicological effects of single well defined compounds. This can be concluded from data reported on the toxicology of a wide range of industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food substances, environmental, and agricultural chemicals. It is possible to model the sensitivity of the rat subchronic feeding study for the detection of hypothetically increased amount of compounds such as anti-nutrients, toxicants or secondary metabolites. With respect to the detection of potential unintended effects in whole GM food and feed, it is unlikely that substances present in small amounts and with a low toxic potential will result in any observable (unintended) effects in a 90-day rodent feeding study, as they would be below the no-observed-effect-level and thus of unlikely impact to human health at normal intake levels. Laboratory animal feeding studies of 90-days duration appear to be sufficient to pick up adverse effects of diverse compounds that would also give adverse effects after chronic exposure. This conclusion is based on literature data from studies investigating whether toxicological effects are adequately identified in 3-month subchronic studies in rodents, by comparing findings at 3 and 24 months for a range of different chemicals. The 90-day rodent feeding study is not designed to detect effects on reproduction or development other than effects on adult reproductive organ weights and histopathology. Analyses of available data indicate that, for a wide range of substances, reproductive and developmental effects are not potentially more sensitive endpoints than those examined in subchronic toxicity tests. Should there be structural alerts for reproductive/developmental effects or other indications from data available on a GM food and feed, then these tests should be considered. By relating the estimated daily intake, or theoretical maximum daily intake per capita for a given whole food (or the sum of its individual commercial constituents) to that consumed on average per rat per day in the subchronic 90-day feeding study, it is possible to establish the margin of exposure (safety margin) for consumers. Results obtained from testing GM food and feed in rodents indicate that large (at least 100-fold) 'safety' margins exist between animal exposure levels without observed adverse effects and estimated human daily intake. Results of feeding studies with feed derived from GM plants with improved agronomic properties, carried out in a wide range of livestock species, are discussed. The studies did not show any biologically relevant differences in the parameters tested between control and test animals. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"
