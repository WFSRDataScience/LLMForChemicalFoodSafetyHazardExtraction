Fusarium infections result in reduced grain yield and contamination with mycotoxins, some of which have a notable impact on human and animal health. Regulations on maximum limits have been established in various countries to protect consumers from the harmful effects of these mycotoxins. Several factors are involved in Fusarium disease and mycotoxin occurrence and among them environmental factors and the agronomic practices have been shown to deeply affect mycotoxin contamination in the field. In the present review particular emphasis will be placed on how environmental conditions and stress factors for the crops can affect Fusarium infection and mycotoxin production, with the aim to provide useful knowledge to develop strategies to prevent mycotoxin accumulation in cereals."

This developed method had been successfully applied to detect ochratoxins in both millet and maize. Molecular modeling revealed that the broad-specificity was related with the chlorine electronegativity on OTA and OTC and the potential of the acetyl ester group on OTC. The proposed ELISA can be used for simultaneous detection of three ochratoxins."

Unfortunately, corn, a major staple crop worldwide, is highly susceptible to mycotoxin contamination. Some mycotoxins, most notably aflatoxin, cause human cancer and other harmful effects such as immunotoxicity and growth impairment. Hence, many nations have set food-safety standards on mycotoxins. Aside from regulations, good agricultural and manufacturing practices lower mycotoxin risks. Agricultural biotechnology has made notable advances in reducing mycotoxins recently. While transgenic Bt corn has been known for years to reduce the mycotoxin fumonisin, new studies have shown its benefit in reducing aflatoxin as well.

In the current research, we developed a probabilistic model based on logistic regression and Ver A levels to estimate the risk of AF contamination in stored corn. Moisture content, aflatoxigenic fungal load, and initial and maximum values of Ver A in the first three sampling cycles were experimentally determined as the four important factors for the probabilistic model. Both internal and external model validations were shown to be high at 96.4% and 93.3%, respectively.

All 13 poor quality samples and the 5 good quality samples positive for fumonisins contained F. verticillioides. Twelve of 13 poor quality samples contained fumonisins (1.4 to 110 microg/g), as did the five good quality samples that were positive for F. verticillioides (0.2 to 3.7 microg of fumonisins per g). Thus, the visible sorting of grain as a technique to reduce the exposure of subsistence farmers to fumonisins could be successful if there were enough good quality grain available to permit the poor quality grain to be used for another purpose or discarded."

The AuNP was modified with IgG and fluorophore-labeled duplex DNA by a polyadenine-based freezing method. The quenched fluorescence can be effectively recovered via duplex-specific nuclease (DSN) with excellent cleaving activity. This approach provided limits of detection (LODs) down to 0.03 ng/mL for ATC, 0.10 ng/mL for metolachlor, 0.14 ng/mL for propisochlor, and 0.08 ng/mL for their mixture. The average recoveries of ATC, metolachlor, and propisochlor were 93.0-106.6% from a corn sample, which are in good agreement with the commercial kit (R2 = 0.9995).

Currently it is estimated that 25% of the world's harvest production is contaminated to some level with these toxins. The presence of fumonisins and deoxynivalenol in corn-based foods, available in Portugal, was analyzed in order to produce some data that may be useful for hazard characterization. A total of 105 samples were screened, including, corn meal (41), sweet corn (49) and corn flakes (15). None of the 15 samples of corn flakes contained some detectable amount of fumonisins. However, fumonisin B1 (FB1) and fumonisin B2 (FB2) contamination was found in 100.0% and 70.7% of the corn meal samples, respectively. Sweet corn samples were positive in 73.4% for FB1, although no FB2 was detected. The highest levels of fumonisin were found in corn meal (maximum: 1300 microg FB1/kg and 450 microg FB2/kg). The presence of deoxynivalenol was not detected in any of the analyzed samples. Nevertheless these results indicate the need to establish, by corn products manufacturers, a continuous monitoring program to prevent and manage the occurrence of these contaminants."

Transgenic Bt crops, including maize, cotton and soya bean, have now been produced and commercialized to protect against about 30 major coleopteran and lepidopteran pests, greatly benefiting the environment and the economy. However, with the long-term cultivation of Bt crops, some target pests have gradually developed resistance. Numerous studies have indicated that mutations in genes for toxins activation, toxin-binding and insect immunization are important sources in Bt resistance.

A survey involving 17 dairy goat farms of north-eastern Italy was completed during 2005 and 2006, in order to evaluate the prevalence of milk contamination and its relationship with type and level of concentrate supplied. RESULTS: 132 concentrate and 85 milk samples were collected during five farm visits and analysed for aflatoxins. Aflatoxin B‚ÇÅ (AFB‚ÇÅ) was > 0.1 Œºg kg‚Åª¬π in two-thirds of the feeds and > 5 Œºg kg‚Åª¬π in nine. Contamination was higher in maize than in other pure feeds (median: 0.8 versus 0.1 Œºg kg‚Åª¬π); complementary feeds showed intermediate values. Aflatoxin M‚ÇÅ (AFM‚ÇÅ) was > 3 ng kg‚Åª¬π in one-third of milks and > 25 ng kg‚Åª¬π in three. All the milk samples were below EU statutory limits. The farm ranks for milk AFM‚ÇÅ level and the peak of concentrate AFB‚ÇÅ contamination were significantly correlated (0.642). CONCLUSIONS: Risk to human health was generally found to be absent, with only a few cases involving feed contamination to be monitored. The main aflatoxin risk for goat milk could arise from maize and maize-based concentrates in the more intensive breeding conditions."

Ready-to-eat (RTE) salads present a challenge in this context due to the absence of a heat treatment step before consumption. This study provides challenge-test based data of the growth characteristics of L. monocytogenes on twelve RTE salads. The food matrix, storage time and storage temperature were factors with a significant impact on the growth of L. monocytogenes. While most tested salads permitted a significant increase of L. monocytogenes in at least one of the tested conditions, no growth was observed on celeriac, carrot and corn salad products.

Aflatoxins were identified and quantitated using a liquid chromatographic technique with a limit of detection of 1 ng/g for each aflatoxin. Aflatoxins were detected in 14 of 109 samples of corn and corn products, 4 of 40 samples of rice and rice products, 2 of 30 samples of legume seeds, and 2 of 11 samples of snacks and breakfast cereals. None of the cereal grains samples analysed contained detectable levels of aflatoxins. Twelve of the total of 22 positive samples exceeded the maximum tolerable level of aflatoxin B1 adopted in most countries (5 ng/g); 10 of these 12 samples corresponded to corn and corn products. The results of the present study indicate that aflatoxin B1 contamination in certain foods in Colombia is a major public health concern. Continuous monitoring of aflatoxin B1 levels in Colombian foods is advised."

According to experts, five kinds of mycotoxins are important in human health around the world: aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, fumonisins, certain trichothecenes, and zearalenone. These toxins are produced by only a few species of fungi, in a limited range of commodities. Aflatoxins are potent carcinogens, produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus in peanuts, maize and some other nuts and oilseeds. Ochratoxin A is a kidney toxin and probable carcinogen. It is produced by Penicillium verrucosum in cereal grains in cold climates, by A. carbonarius in grapes, wines and vine fruits, and by A. ochraceus sometimes in coffee beans. Fumonisins, which may cause oesophageal cancer, are formed by Fusarium moniliforme and F. proliferatum, but only in maize. Trichothecenes are highly immunosuppressive and zearalenone causes oestrogenic effects; both are produced by F. graminearum and related species.

To evaluate the risk of AFM1 contamination in milk, it is necessary to analyze the risk factors of AFB1 contamination in corn provided for concentrated feed in Japan. The AFM1 level in domestic raw bulk milk was measured at three sampling times, January, February and June in 2004. The AFB1 contamination in corn supplied to cows was determined at the same time as the sampling of raw milk. The AFM1 contamination levels in milk in January, February and June 2004 were 0.011, 0.007 and 0.005 ng/g, respectively. The AFB1 contamination level in the corn of the concentrated feed was higher from October of 2003 to February of 2004 than from April to June in 2004.

Because traditional physical and chemical methods could not effectively detoxify ZEN in grains, and might also affect the grain nutrients and food taste, and even result in secondary pollution, the biological technologies are developed to detoxify ZEN and its derivatives. In this paper, we reviewed the structure of ZEN and its derivatives, the fungi and bacteria species with ability of degradation of ZEN. In addition, the characterization, protein sequences and conformation of currently identified ZEN degrading enzymes, the only solved ZHD structure from Clonostachys rose were analyzed and compared, and the enzymes heterologous expression and application were also reviewed.

It was found that 40.1% of the young people ate street food 2-3 times per week, whereas 23.3% were found to eat it every day. Turkish bagels, d√∂ner, boiled corn in a cup and toast are most preferred street foods. A statistically significant negative correlations were found between consumption preference scores and education, gender, and age. Although consumers know that street foods can cause contamination with microorganisms, that sellers do not pay attention to hygiene, and that these foods are raw or not cooked well, they prefer because of their cheapness, deliciousness, variety and fast service. Street foods are widely consumed in Turkish young students and because of preventing food poisoning, they should be educated about food hygiene and safety.

To produce large amounts of pure FB1, a novel purifying method was developed by using centrifugal partition chromatography, which is a prominent member of the liquid-liquid chromatographic techniques. Rice cultured with Fusarium verticillioides was extracted with a mixture of methanol/water and found to contain 0.87 mg of FB1 per gram. The crude extracts were purified on a strong anion-exchange column and then separated by using a biphasic solvent system consisting of methyl-tert-butyl-ether-acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid in water. The collected fractions were analysed by flow injection-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Corona-charged aerosol detector and identified by congruent retention time on high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometric data. This method produced approximately 120 mg of FB1 with a purity of more than 98% from 200 g of the rice culture. The whole purification process is able to produce a large amount of pure FB1 for analytical applications or for toxicological studies."

A case-control study based on three-day duplicate diet samples was performed in Huai'an District. One hundred EPL cases and 100 healthy controls were enrolled and required to be age- (¬±2 years) and gender-matched. The concentration of AFB1 in food samples and the level of serum AFB1-albumin (AFB1-Alb) adduct were quantitatively analyzed. Results showed that corn flour intake was positively associated with serum AFB1-Alb adduct level (p for trend = 0.003), dietary AFB1 exposure (p for trend < 0.001), and the risk of EPL (p for trend = 0.017). Increased serum AFB1-Alb adduct level was associated with an increased risk of EPL as well (p for trend < 0.001).

Agricultural-product intake constitutes a principal source for As exposure in humans. In this study, the contribution of the chemical-soil parameters in As accumulation and translocation in the maize crop from a mining area of San Luis Potosi was evaluated. The total arsenic concentration and arsenic speciation were determined by HG-AFS and IC-HG-AFS, respectively. The data analysis was conducted by cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The soil pH presented a negative correlation with the accumulated As in each maize plant part, and parameters such as iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) presented a higher correlation with the As translocation in maize. Thus, the metabolic stress in maize may induce organic acid exudation leading a higher As bioavailability. A high As inorganic/organic ratio in edible maize plant tissues suggests a substantial risk of poisoning by this metalloid. Careful attention to the chemical changes in the rhizosphere of the agricultural zones that can affect As transfer through the food chain could reduce the As-intoxication risk of maize consumers."

Using isotope analysis, taking advantage of the different carbon isotope composition (Œ¥13C) of fossil-derived PE and C4 plants (e. g. , maize), we estimated that about 30% of the carbon in the rhizosphere of microplastic-exposed plants was derived from PE. Still, we did not find evidence of PE translocation to the shoots. Plastic bioaccumulation in the rhizosphere caused a significant decline in transpiration, nitrogen content, and growth. Our results indicate that plastic particles may accumulate in the rhizosphere, impairing water and nutrient uptake, and eventually reaching root eaters. Due to the implications for food production and livestock feeding, our findings encourage further research on the mechanism leading to the bioaccumulation of microplastics on the surface of belowground tissues."

In conclusion, increased soil PAE concentrations specifically in maize and wheat grains indicate that wastewater irrigation can pose a contamination threat to food resources."

The utilization of agricultural waste such as corn stalk (CS) to produce biosorbents has been considered an ecofriendly and efficient approach for removing oil. However, most previous studies focused on the modification of the whole CS, which is inefficient due to the heterogeneity of CS. In this study, corn stalk pith (CP), which has excellent amphipathic characteristics, was selected to prepare a high-efficiency oil sorbent by grafting dodecyl gallate (DG, a long-chain alkyl) onto CP surface lignin via laccase mediation. The modified biomass (DGCP) shows high hydrophobicity (water contact angle¬†=¬†140.2¬∞) and superoleophilicity (oil contact angle¬†=¬†0¬∞) and exhibits a high oil sorption capacity (46.43 g/g). In addition, DGCP has good stability and reusability for adsorbing oil from the aqueous phase. Kinetic and isotherm models and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy integrated with FTIR analyses revealed that the main sorption mechanism involves the H-bond effect, hydrophobic effect and van der Waals force. This work provides an ecofriendly method to prepare oil sorbents and new insights into the mechanisms underlying the removal of spilled oil from wastewater."

DON is one of the big five agriculturally important mycotoxins, resulting from Fusarium infection on grains, such as maize, barley, and wheat. In many countries, such as Canada, DON is the mycotoxin of principal concern because it can lead to major economic losses and stresses on food and feed security. The challenges discussed here include (1) understanding the different toxin profiles of Fusarium graminearum chemotypes/genotypes and the fate of these toxins upon interaction with the host crop, (2) the need for rapid analytical tests to measure DON and any masked or modified toxins in food and feed products, (3) DON exposure assessments in human populations to ensure health and safety, and (4) how contaminated food and feed products can be managed throughout the supply chain system.

The extraction method carried out with a Romer Mycosep 226 column was found to be efficient due to addition of both diatomaceous earth and centrifuging during the cleaning step. From the total of 84 analyzed samples, 78.6% (n =‚Äâ66) were found to be contaminated ZEA at levels between 15.4 and 72.1 Œºg/kg. This study was the first report on occurrence of positive samples for ZEA in corn meal commercialized in Parana since 2005. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of ZEA for the Brazilian population and for the State of Parana was 3.1 and 2.2 ng/kg‚Äâbw/day, respectively. The EDI was below the tolerable daily intake of 250‚Äâng/kg‚Äâbw/day. Despite the low health risk of the population, it was observed that the occurrence of ZEA in corn meal was frequent, which demonstrates the importance of monitoring studies to ensure consumer's health. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Occurrence of zearalenone in corn meal was high (78.6%) in Brazil. First report on corn meal samples positive for zearalenone in Paran√°, Brazil. No sample exceeded the tolerated limit by both Brazilian and European legislation. EDI due to corn meal consumption was inferior to TDI."

Herein, a novel fluorescent aptasensor using metal-organic frameworks (UiO-66-NH2) and TAMRA label aptamer as sensing platform for AFB1 detection was developed. The TAMRA aptamer adsorbed on the surface of UiO-66-NH2 via van der Waals force and its fluorescence was quenched for the charge transfer from fluorescence dye TAMRA to metal ions of UiO-66-NH2. After introducing AFB1 to the system, the TAMRA aptamer binded to AFB1 and formed TAMRA aptamer/AFB1complex, making its conformation change and resulting in fluorescence recovery. Thus, the quantity of AFB1 could be analyzed according to the fluorescence signal change. Under optimize experimental conditions, the assay exhibited high sensitivity toward AFB1 in range of 0-180¬†ng¬†mL-1 with low limit of detection of 0.35¬†ng¬†mL-1 and good specificity against other toxins. Moreover, the aptamer/metal-organic frameworks sensing platform could be utilized to determine AFB1 content in food samples such as corn, rice and milk.

Expression of Cry proteins, the active toxicant found in Bt corn tissues, differed among hybrids, and especially so in the concentrations found in pollen of different events. In most commercial hybrids, Bt expression in pollen is low, and laboratory and field studies show no acute toxic effects at any pollen density that would be encountered in the field. Other factors mitigating exposure of larvae include the variable and limited overlap between pollen shed and larval activity periods, the fact that only a portion of the monarch population utilizes milkweed stands in and near cornfields, and the current adoption rate of Bt corn at 19% of North American corn-growing areas.

Sorting plastic kernels of known size and shape enabled us to optimize the sorting performance of the DropSort. The device sorted maize into three distinct fractions as measured by bulk density and 100-kernel weight. The level of fumonisin was lower in the heaviest fractions of maize compared to the unsorted samples. Based on correlations among fumonisin and bulk characteristics of each fraction, we found that light fraction 100-kernel weight could be an inexpensive proxy for unsorted fumonisin concentration. Single kernel analysis revealed significant relationships among kernel fumonisin content and physical characteristics that could prove useful for future sorting efforts.

In this study, we exposed larvae of O. furnacalis to a diet containing Cd and investigated the effects of Cd on the development, mating behavior, and fecundity of the insect. We showed that Cd accumulates in the larvae and inhibits development by extending larval and pupal duration and decreasing the survival rate. The excretion of Cd through multiple routes during the larval and pupal stages resulted in low levels of residual Cd in the adult insects, which were not fed with Cd. However, the mating behavior and fecundity of these insects were significantly affected, compared to control insects.

In maize, fumonisins are among the toxins with the highest threatening potential because they are mainly produced by Fusarium verticillioides, which is distributed worldwide. Plant breeding has emerged as an effective and environmentally safe method to reduce fumonisin levels in maize kernels, but although phenotypic selection has proved effective for improving resistance to fumonisin contamination, further resources should be mobilized to meet farmers' needs. Selection based on molecular markers linked to quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to fumonisin contamination or/and genotype values obtained using prediction models with markers distributed across the whole genome could speed up breeding progress. Therefore, in the current paper, previously identified genomic regions, genes, and/or pathways implicated in resistance to fumonisin accumulation will be reviewed. Studies done until now have provide many markers to be used by breeders, but to get further insight on plant mechanisms to defend against fungal infection and to limit fumonisin contamination, the genes behind those QTLs should be identified."

Six dogs were given a low-level, sub-clinical dose of aflatoxin B(1). On average, 71.5% of aflatoxin M(1) cleared within 6 h after dosing, increasing to 90.4% after 12 h. Aflatoxin M(1) was no longer detectable in urine after 48 h. Aflatoxin P(1) was not found in urine compared to large amounts of M(1) and trace amounts of Q(1). In a crossover study, six dogs randomly fed a commercial dog food (no-clay control) or coated with HSCAS (0.5% by weight) were subsequently administered a sub-clinical dose of aflatoxin B(1). Diets were switched and the process repeated. The HSCAS-coated diet significantly reduced urinary aflatoxin M(1) by 48.4%+/-16.6 SD versus the control diet. In conclusion, HSCAS protects dogs fed diets with even minimal aflatoxin contamination. Despite regular and careful ingredient screening for aflatoxin, low concentrations may reach the final product undetected.

Laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the potential effects of Cry1Ab/Cry2Aj-producing transgenic Bt maize (Shuangkang 12-5) pollen on F. candida fitness. Survival, development, and the reproduction were not significantly reduced when F.¬†candida fed on Bt maize pollen rather than on non-Bt maize pollen, but these parameters were significantly reduced when F.¬†candida fed on non-Bt maize pollen containing the protease inhibitor E-64¬†at 75¬†Œºg/g pollen. The intrinsic rate of increase (rm) was not significantly reduced when F. candida fed on Bt maize pollen but was significantly reduced when F. candida fed on non-Bt maize pollen containing E-64. The activities of antioxidant-related enzymes in F.¬†candida were not significantly affected when F.¬†candida fed on Bt maize pollen but were significantly increased when F.¬†candida fed on non-Bt pollen containing E-64. The results demonstrate that consumption of Bt maize pollen containing Cry1Ab/Cry2Aj has no lethal or sublethal effects on F.¬†candida."

In our experimental approach, we carried out 3-year field trials on 6 ha total. Three treatments were used in a randomized block design with eight replications resulting in 24 plots: (i) near-isogenic control variety without insecticide (control), (ii) near-isogenic control variety with chemical insecticide (Baytroid) and (iii) Bt maize expressing the recombinant toxin. We established a weed strip (20 x 1 m) in every plot consisting of a Chenopodium album (goosefoot)/Sinapis alba (mustard) mixture. In these strips we measured diversity and abundance of lepidopteran larvae during maize bloom and pollen shed. C. album hosted five species but all in very low densities; therefore data were not suitable for statistical analysis. S. alba hosted nine species in total. Most abundant were Plutella xylostella and Pieris rapae. For these species no differences were detected between the Bt treatment and the control, but the chemical insecticide treatment reduced larval abundance significantly.

The discovery of six KP4-like genes in F. verticillioides precipitated efforts to understand their function and evolutionary origin. Analysis of publicly available genomic sequence identified 31 additional KP4-like genes from a range of Ascomycota, a Basidiomycota, and the moss Physcomitrella patens. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis indicate that the viral KP4 and the moss and fungal KP4-like genes evolved from a common ancestor providing evidence for lateral gene transfer between kingdoms. Six genes of the 37 total genes are predicted to encode a protein with two, non-identical KP4-like domains in tandem separated by 29-56 amino acids.

In the present study, Bt Cry1Ac protein was hydrolyzed by pronase that was secreted by the soil bacterium Streptomyces griseus. Six peptides were identified as the products of enzymatic hydrolysis by nano liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). One of the six peptides was labeled with radioactive isotope iodine-125 and then purified. The 125I-peptide solution was irrigated to the rhizosphere soil of watermelon seedlings (Citrullus lanatus L. ) and wheat seedlings (Triticum aestivum L. ), which the two crops usually intercrop with cotton in China. Detection of radioactivity in both plant tissues within one hour proved adsorption, uptake and translocation of the peptide into watermelon and wheat seedlings. Three of the identified peptides were sprayed onto the seedling leaves of watermelon, wheat and maize (Zea mays L. ) in the field or the growth chamber. No significant effects on plant growth were observed. These peptides also did not affect growth of organic phosphate-dissolving, nitrogen-fixing, and potassium-dissolving bacteria in the culture.

Furthermore, the roles of plant biomacromolecules such as lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), CYP and GST enzymes in driving the biological processes of TBECH stereoisomers were explored. The uptake and translocation of TBECH in maize were diastereo- and enantio-selective. Isomerization from Œ±- to Œ¥-TBECH and Œ≤- to Œ≥-TBECH, and metabolites of debromination, hydroxylation and TBECH-GSH adducts were identified in maize roots. The gene expressions of LTPs, CYPs and GSTs were extensively changed in maize after exposure to technical TBECH. CYP and GST enzyme activities as well as GST31 and CYP71C3v2 gene expressions were selectively induced or inhibited by TBECH diastereomers over time. TBECH was able to dock into the active sites and bind with specific residues of the typical biomacromolecules ZmLTP1.6, GST31 and CYP71C3v2, indicating their roles in the bioaccumulation and metabolization of TBECH. Binding modes and affinities to biomacromolecules were significantly different between Œ±- and Œ≤-TBECH, which contributed to their stereo-selectivity. This study provided a deep understanding of the biological fate of TBECH, and revealed the driving molecular mechanisms of the selectivity of TBECH stereoisomers in plants."

It is recommended that biodegradable materials be used to develop low-impact designs for better packaging, which could benefit the environment by simply expanding their use to new areas. In this work, corn starch, glycerol and blueberry powder (with and without prior fruit bleaching) were used to produce films by casting. Blueberry powder, a co-product from juice processing, which is rich in anthocyanins, was added in the films to evaluate its potential as a colorimetric indicator, due to the ability of anthocyanin to change color when placed in an acidic or basic environment. After the films were immersed in different buffer solutions, visual color changes were observed, where the films became reddish at acidic pH and bluish at basic pH. The ŒîE* values were greater than 3, suggesting a visually perceptible change to the human eye. The samples with fruit bleaching (CB) were visually darker (lower luminance values), while the samples without bleaching (SB) had a lighter color and higher brightness, represented by larger L* values.

Decontamination procedures currently used are based on (a) physical, chemical, or biological removal, or (c) physical or chemical inactivation. Ammoniation of corn, peanuts, cottonseed, and meals to alter the toxic and carcinogenic effects of aflatoxin contamination has been the subject of intense research effort by scientists in various government agencies and universities worldwide. Engineers have devised workable systems of treatment of whole seeds, kernels, or meals; chemists have identified and characterized products formed from the reaction of aflatoxin B1 with ammonia with and without a meal matrix; biochemists have studied the biological effects of these compounds in model systems; and nutritionists have studied animal responses to rations containing ammoniated or non-ammoniated components.

Silage is green forage preserved by lactic fermentation under anaerobic conditions. This ecosystem maintains its quality and nutritional value depending on interactions among physical, chemical and biological agents. Forages used for ensilage are naturally in contact with yeasts and filamentous fungi, and the contamination often occurs in the field and can also occur during harvesting, transport, storage.

However, it was recommended that the human daily' intake of fumonisins should be less than 1 microg/kg bw/day. Subsequently, the presence of the Fusarium mycotoxins fumonisin B1 and B2 (FB1 and FB2) in corn-based food on the Danish retail market has been determined. A total of 70 samples were analysed and 37% contained FB1 and 21% contained FB2. No fumonisins were found in sweet corn (canned or frozen), corn-on-the-cob, corn starch or gruel powder for babies. FB1 was found in about half of the corn flakes, corn snack and popcorn (not popped) samples, whereas FB2 was seen to a lesser extent. Both FB1 and FB2 were found in 75% or more of the corn flour, tacos and polenta samples. In general, the content of FB1 was in the range of 1-1000 micro/kg and the content of FB2 was in the range of 4-250 microg/kg. Corn-based foods are consumed in rather low amounts and irregularly among the Danish population and therefore it is not meaningful to calculate an average daily funonisin intake. An estimate for an 'eater' shows that the intake of fumonisins will not exceed 0.4 microg/kg bw/day."

Hepatitis B virus in individuals further increases the risk of HCC. The two risk factors are prevalent in rural Kenya and continuously predispose the rural populations to HCC. A quantitative cancer risk assessment therefore quantified the levels at which potential pre- and postharvest interventions reduce the HCC risk attributable to consumption of contaminated maize and groundnuts. The assessment applied a probabilistic model to derive probability distributions of HCC cases and percentage reductions levels of the risk from secondary data. Contaminated maize and groundnuts contributed to 1,847 ¬± 514 and 158 ¬± 52 HCC cases per annum, respectively. The total contribution of both foods to the risk was additive as it resulted in 2,000 ¬± 518 cases per annum. Consumption and contamination levels contributed significantly to the risk whereby lower age groups were most affected. Nonetheless, pre- and postharvest interventions might reduce the risk by 23.0-83.4% and 4.8-95.1%, respectively. Therefore, chronic exposure to aflatoxins increases the HCC risk in rural Kenya, but a significant reduction of the risk can be achieved by applying specific pre- and postharvest interventions."

In the present study, we briefly summarize the data regarding the development and commercial use of transgenic Bt varieties, elaborate on the procedure and methods for assessing the non-target effects of insect-resistant GE plants, and synthetically analyze the related research results, mostly those published between 2005 and 2010. A mass of laboratory and field studies have shown that the currently available Bt crops have no direct detrimental effects on NTOs due to their narrow spectrum of activity, and Bt crops are increasing the abundance of some beneficial insects and improving the natural control of specific pests. The use of Bt crops, such as Bt maize and Bt cotton, results in significant reductions of insecticide application and clear benefits on the environment and farmer health. Consequently, Bt crops can be a useful component of integrated pest management systems to protect the crop from targeted pests."

The development of a rapid, sensitive, and simple method for OTA detection is important to ensure food biosafety and safeguard public health. In this study, we designed a highly specific and sensitive assay for the detection of OTA using copper monosulfide (CuS) nanoparticles conjugated to an anti-OTA antibody (CuS-Ab NPs) and a fluorescent probe for Cu2+. When OTA is present in the solution, the OTA antigen, bound to the microplate, is competed off by the soluble OTA for binding to CuS-Ab NPs. After washing, the CuS-Ab NPs and bound OTA are removed. Subsequently, HCl is added to dissolve the CuS-Ab NPs bound to the OTA antigen, releasing Cu2+ and activating the Cu2+ fluorescent probe. Thus, the resultant fluorescence emission is inversely proportional to the OTA content in the solution. Under optimal conditions, this method detected 0.1-100¬†ng¬†mL-1 OTA with a limit of detection of 0.01¬†ng¬†mL-1.

To broaden the application of ellagic acid (EA) in maize flour products, we investigated the interaction between zein and EA. The fluorescence quenching type of zein interacting with EA was mainly static quenching through hydrophobic interaction, as demonstrated by quenching behavior modeling, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy confirmed the formation of zein-EA complexes. Synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy showed that EA reduced the polarity of zein around tyrosine residues, which were exposed to a more hydrophobic microenvironment. Meanwhile, circular dichroism suggested that EA noticeably changed the secondary structure of zein, which was mainly reflected in the increase of Œ±-helix and Œ≤-sheet content and the decrease of random coil content. Finally, the molecular docking simulation found that zein could have five active sites binding to EA and there was hydrogen bond interaction besides hydrophobic interaction.

Therefore, it can cause endocrine-disrupting effects and promote the proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive cell lines. In addition, ZEN can cause oxidative damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress, apoptosis, and other hazards, resulting in systemic toxic effects, including reproductive toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and immunotoxicity. In the past few decades, researchers have tried many ways to remove ZEN from food and feed, but it is still a challenge to eliminate it. In recent years, natural compounds have become of interest for their excellent protective effects on human health from food contaminants. Researchers have discovered that natural compounds often used as dietary supplements can effectively alleviate ZEN-induced systemic toxic effects.

Due to their role in mycoremediation, the mushrooms also absorb pollutants from the substrates into their fruit bodies. This article reviews the sources of agricultural biomass for mushroom cultivation that could track how the environmental heavy metals are accumulated and translocated into mushroom fruit bodies. This review also discusses the possible health risks from prolonged uptakes of heavy metal-contaminated mushrooms to highlight the importance of early contaminants' detection for food security."

For this purpose, a monoclonal antibody (3H12) posed highly resistant to pH (5.6 to 9.6) and ethanol (‚â§50%) was generated by mouse immunization. Negative maize and rice samples or samples spiked with CPA were extracted with ethanol/0.01 M sodium borate buffer (4/1, v/v, pH 8.4).

Finally, ZmNRAMP6 that encodes a metal transporter was identified as the hub gene among the Pb tolerance-associated co-expression module. Heterologous expression of ZmNRAMP6 in yeast verified its role in Pb transport. Combined Arabidopsis overexpression and maize mutant analysis suggested that ZmNRAMP6 conferred plant sensitivity to Pb stress by transporting Pb ion from the roots to shoots. Knockout of ZmNRAMP6 caused Pb retention in the roots and activation of the antioxidant enzyme system, resulting in an increased Pb tolerance in maize. An integration of yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase reporter assay uncovered that ZmNRAMP6 was negatively regulated by a known Pb tolerance-related transcript factor ZmbZIP54.

The uptake of novel per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) by plants represents a potential pathway for their transfer in the food chain. In this study, the bioavailability of these four novel PFASs in soil and the bioaccumulation characteristics in greenhouse-grown wheat (Triticum aestivum L. ), maize (Zea mays L. ), soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill), and pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima L. ) were investigated. The results indicated that these novel PFASs with higher hydrophobicity were more easily sequestrated in soil, and the fractions extracted by methanol could well describe their bioavailability, which could be stimulated by low-molecular-weight organic acids at rhizospheric concentrations. A negative relationship was found between root soil concentration factors (RSCFs) and hydrophobicity (log‚ÄØKow) of the target PFASs. This correlation was also found in the translocation factors (TF) from roots to shoots. Furthermore, the uptake and transfer of the target PFASs were regulated by the protein contents in plant roots and shoots."

Herein, a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic (SERS) method combined with QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap-effective, rugged, safe) sample pretreatment technique was used to detect aflatoxin B1. Sample preparation was optimized into a one-step extraction method using an Au nanoparticle-based solution (Au sol) as the SERS detection substrate. An affordable portable Raman spectrometer was then used for rapid, label-free, quantitative detection of aflatoxin B1 levels in foodstuffs. This method showed a good linear log relationship between the Raman signal intensity of aflatoxin B1 in the 1-1000‚Äâ¬µg L-1 concentration range with a limit of detection of 0.85‚Äâ¬µg‚Äâkg-1 and a correlation coefficient of 0.9836.

Among the cereals, Pb contents were higher in foxtail millet (54.3 ng/g) and lower in maize (35.4 ng Pb/g; grain and flour in combination), wheat flour (28.8 ng Pb/g) and rice flour (22.7 ng Pb/g). Lead levels in two important types of pulses, kidney bean and soybean (24.6 and 30.8 ng Pb/g, respectively), were comparable to the levels in rice and wheat. In contrast, Cd levels were substantially higher in pulses (55.7 ng Cd/g) than in cereals (9.2 ng Cd/g), and among the pulses, Cd in soybean (55.7 ng Cd/g) was significantly higher than that in kidney bean (23.8 ng Cd/g). The possible public health implication of the Pb and Cd levels, especially the high Pb level in foxtail millet (54.3 ng Pb/g) and the high Cd level in soybean (73.5 ng Cd/g), is discussed."

In this study, a signal-on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor which combined the characteristics of high efficiency of hyperbranched rolling circle amplification (HRCA) and high selectivity of aptamer was developed for OTA determination. The capture probe DNA (CDNA) was firstly immobilized on the gold electrode surface through Au-S interaction, then the OTA aptamer was modified on the electrode surface through hybridization with CDNA. Since OTA can competitively bind with the aptamer due to their high affinity, which would induce the releasing of aptamer from the electrode surface. Subsequently, the free CDNA on the electrode surface can hybridize with the padlock probe and induce HRCA reaction subsequently. Thus, the HRCA products which contained large amount of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragments can be accumulated on the electrode surface. Since Ru(phen)3(2+) can intercalate into the groove of dsDNA and acts as ECL indicator, high ECL intensity can be detected from the electrode surface. The enhanced ECL intensity has a linear relationship with OTA in the range of 0.05-500 pg/mL with a correlation coefficient of 0.9957, and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.02 pg/mL. The developed biosensor has been applied to determine OTA concentration in the corn samples with satisfied results."

They represent an unavoidable problem due to their presence in globally consumed cereals such as rice, maize and wheat. Most mycotoxins are immunosuppressive agents and some are carcinogens, hepatotoxins, nephrotoxins, and neurotoxins. Worldwide trends envision a stricter control of mycotoxins, however, the changing global environment may not be the ideal setting to control and reduce the exposure to these toxins. Although new technologies allow us to inspect the multi-mycotoxin presence in foods, new sources of exposure, gaps in knowledge of mycotoxins interactions, appearance of ""emergent"" mycotoxins and elucidation of consequent health effects can complicate their control even more. While humans are adapting to cope with environmental changes, such as food scarcity, decreased food quality, mycotoxin regulations, crop production and seasonality, and other climate related modifications, fungal species are also adapting and increased cases of mycotoxin adverse health effects are likely to occur in the future. To guarantee access to quality food for all, we need a way to balance global mycotoxin standards with the realistic feasibility of reaching them, considering limitations of producers and designing strategies to reduce mycotoxin exposure based on sound research."

This system has been described as ""complementarity"" because it involves interaction and trade in goods produced at different Andean elevations. We find that as local farming societies adapted to this new asymmetric system, a portion of their labor had to be given up to the Inka elite through a corv√©e tax system for maize production. In return, the Inka system of complementarity introduced previously rare foods from the Andean highlands into local economies. These changes caused a disruption of traditional communities as they instituted a state-level economic system on local farmers.

Pesticide use increased by 46% from 1973 to 1983. From 1983, the baseline year for Food Systems 2002, to 1998, pesticide use decreased by 38.5% and risk declined 39.5%. The reductions in pesticide use and risk were primarily on corn (Zea mays L. ) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. ), the crops with the highest pesticide use in 1983. Total pesticide use on soybean [Glycine max (L. ) Merr. ] did not change, but the mean application rate (kg ha(-1)) decreased by 57%. Corn and soybean account for 65% of pesticide use, but have a relatively low pesticide use and risk per hectare and per tonne of production. Total pesticide use on tobacco, fruits, and vegetables was lower than on corn or soybean, but the pesticide use and risk per hectare were much higher. Small reductions in pesticide use on corn and soybean may allow a 50% reduction in pesticide use, but greater reductions in risk can be achieved by reducing the use of ""high risk"" pesticides on fruit and vegetables."

Provitamin A biofortified maize stiff porridges were prepared and their retained provitamin A was determined using lutein, zeaxanthin, Œ≤-cryptoxanthin, and Œ≤-carotene (all-trans and cis isomers) as standards. Provitamin A concentration in the biofortified porridges ranged from 2.24 to 3.18 ¬µg/g and retention from 91-105%. Descriptive sensory analysis and the 5-point facial hedonic test were used to evaluate the sensory quality of the porridges. The biofortified maize porridges were described as sticky, fine, with high intensity residual grain, and having a slightly bitter aftertaste with a cooked maize flavour and aroma, whereas the intensities of these attributes were insignificant in white maize porridge. About 33% of the consumer sample (N = 60) liked the porridges and 28% disliked the porridges, whilst approximately 38% of the consumers were neutral.

In subchronic oral studies, TCP produced toxicity in kidneys, liver, and other tissues. TCP administered by corn oil gavage in chronic studies produced tumors at multiple sites in rats and mice; however, interpretation of these studies was impeded by substantial premature mortality. Drinking water equivalent levels (DWELs) were estimated for a lifetime of consumption by applying biologically-based safety/risk assessment approaches, including Monte Carlo techniques, and with consideration of kinetics and modes of action, to possibly replace default assumptions. Internationally recognized Frameworks for human relevance of animal data were employed to interpret the findings. Calculated were a reference dose (=39 microg/kg d) for non-cancer and Cancer Values (CV) (=10-14 microg/kg d) based on non-linear dose-response relationships for mutagenicity as a precursor of cancer.

Neither K49 nor NRRL 21882 produce CPA and when challenged with K54 and F3W4, CPA and aflatoxins were reduced by 84-97% and 83-98%, respectively. In contrast, AF36 reduced aflatoxins by 20% with F3W4 and 93% with K54 and showed no reduction in CPA with F3W4 and only a 62% reduction in CPA with K54. Because AF36 produces CPA, high levels of CPA accumulate when maize is inoculated with AF36 alone or in combination with F3W4 or K54.

Although authorities may set maximum levels, these regulations are not effective in subsistence farming communities. As maize is consumed in large quantities, exposure to mycotoxins will surpass safe levels even where the contamination levels are below the regulated maximum levels. It is clear that the lowering of exposure in these communities requires an integrated approach. Detailed understanding of agricultural practices, mycotoxin occurrence, climate change/weather patterns, human exposure and risk are warranted to guide adequate intervention programmes. Risk communication and creating awareness in affected communities are also critical.

In some cases, the reduction of mycotoxins afforded by Bt corn is significant enough to have an economic impact, both in terms of domestic markets and international trade. In less developed countries where certain mycotoxins are significant contaminants of food, Bt corn adoption, by virtue of its mycotoxin reduction, may even improve human and animal health. This paper describes an integrated assessment model that analyzes the economic and health impacts of two mycotoxins in corn: fumonisin and aflatoxin. It was found that excessively strict standards of these two mycotoxins could result in global trade losses in the hundreds of millions US dollars annually, with the US, China, and Argentina suffering the greatest losses. The paper then discusses the evidence for Bt corn's lower levels of contamination of fumonisin and aflatoxin, and estimates economic impacts in the United States. A total benefit of Bt corn's reduction of fumonisin and aflatoxin in the US was estimated at 23 million dollars annually.

DON and ZON are relatively stable during extrusion cooking but the fumonisins are lost to varying degrees. There is some loss of ZON when present in low concentrations and extruded at higher moisture contents. The presence of additives, such as reducing sugars and sodium chloride, can also affect mycotoxin levels. Moisture content of the cereal feed during extrusion is important and has a greater effect than temperature, particularly on the loss of fumonisins at the lower moistures. The effects are complex and not easy to explain, although more energy input to the extruder is required for drier materials.

We collected whole-grain samples from farmers' storage sheds and milled samples from patrons of local mills. Mean aflatoxin contamination was identical for storage sheds and mills at 2.3 ppb. In all, 41% of the samples from mills had detectable aflatoxin, with 4% over the regulatory limit, whereas 87% had detectable fumonisin, with 50% over the regulatory limit (1 ppm). Mean contamination levels did not change during storage. Maize varieties differed in fumonisin contamination, with the most popular varieties vulnerable to both mycotoxins and weevils, which are potential factors in exacerbating mycotoxin contamination.

There were ten treatment groups comprising a mixture of biochar, hydroxyapatite (HAP), manure, and plant ash in varying proportions and at three different rates. Compared with untreated soil, all treatments increased pH by 2-3 units in bulk soil or 1-2 units in rhizosphere soil. For all amendments, the concentration of Cd in all parts of maize plants was decreased compared with unamended soil, but this effect was much smaller for Pb. The greatest effect was found with a mixture containing the ratio of HAP:manure:biochar:plant ash as 6:4:2:1 when applied at 20.1¬†t¬†ha-1. The dominant microbial group in contaminated soil was Proteobacteria. There is evidence that this group can immobilize Cd by mechanisms that include biosorption and bioprecipitation.

Models were development using 332 cases collected between 1998 and 2001. Thirty cases collected in 2002 were used to validate the models. Preplanting data showed a strong relationship with late-season gray leaf spot severity classes. The most important predictors were SR, PD, GLSR, and LON. Logistic regression models correctly classified 60 to 70% of the validation cases, whereas the CART models correctly classified 57 to 77% of these cases. Cases misclassified by the CART models were mostly due to overestimation, whereas the logistic regression models tended to misclassify cases by underestimation.

We performed monospecific and combined culture experiments in a soil-maize-earthworm testing system to determine the interactive effects between earthworms and maize plants on the accumulation and toxicity of cadmium (Cd) to each respective species. It was found that the co-presence of maize plants and earthworms in soil promoted the mobility and availability of Cd, but reduced Cd accumulation in earthworms and maize roots and showed little effects on cadmium's accumulation in maize stems and leaves. The presence of plants reduced Cd toxicity to earthworm cocoon output and body mass development, while the presence of earthworms showed no significant effects on Cd toxicity to maize shoot and root biomass. Meanwhile, the presence of earthworms reversed the effects of Cd on soil microbial community and stimulated and increased maize rhizosphere microbial species. It was concluded that the increase of metal mobility and availability in a multi-species testing system does not necessarily indicate a corresponding increase of ecotoxicity, and the interspecific effects between species belonging to different trophic levels on the accumulation and toxicity of metals should be taken into account in ecotoxicological risk assessment."

When ruminants eat AFB(1)-feedstuffs, they metabolise the toxin and excrete AFM(1) in milk. To control AFM(1) in foods it is necessary to reduce AFB(1) contamination of feeds for dairy cattle by preventing fungal growth and AFB(1) formation in agricultural commodities intended for animal use. Corn and corn-based products are one of the most contaminated feedstuffs; therefore risk factor analysis of AFB(1) contamination in corn is necessary to evaluate risk of AFM(1) contamination in milk and milk products. During the corn silage production, the aflatoxins production is mostly influenced by: harvest time; fertilization; irrigation; pest control; silage moisture; and storage practices. Due to the lower moisture at harvest and to the conservation methods, the corn grain is mostly exposed to the contamination by Aspergillus species. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the probability of this contaminant through choice of: hybrids; seeding time and density; suitable ploughing and fertirrigation; and chemical or biological control. Grains harvested with the lowest possible moisture and conservation moisture close to or less than 14% are necessary to reduce contamination risks, as is maintaining mass to homogeneous moisture. Kernel mechanical damage, grain cleaning practices and conservation temperature are also factors which need to be carefully controlled."

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the residual effect of the application of SSB obtained at different pyrolysis temperatures on the accumulation, availability and bioaccumulation of HMs by corn cultivated in a tropical soil. For this purpose, a field experiment was conducted for three years to assess the total and available levels of HMs in the soil and the leaf concentration after suspending the application of 30¬†t¬†ha-1 of SSB produced at 300¬†¬∞C (BC300) and 500¬†¬∞C (BC500). In general, the HM contents were below the maximum allowed by environmental legislation in several countries. SSB, regardless of temperature, was effective in immobilizing non-essential HMs for plants, such as Cd, Co, Cr and Pb, in the soil. On the other hand, SSB was able to supply micronutrients to corn plants after amendment ceased. Thus, the lack of negative long-term effects confirms the feasibility and safety of using SSB in agricultural areas with regards to contamination by HM, and makes it an alternative for the disposal of domestic SS."

However, maize incurs considerable losses both in field and storage due to pathogens and insects. Some of the pathogens and resultant mycotoxins reduce the nutritional quality of the product. Mycotoxins are toxigenic fungal compounds that can cause cancer and suppress growth. In spite of this health hazard, there has been very little research to document their occurrence. Maize grains stored for human consumption were sampled from different agro-ecosystems (forest, valley and plateau areas) of three agroecological zones (high, mid and low altitude). RESULTS: Several fungal genera were recovered among which Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Fusarium verticillioides, F. solani, Rhizopus stolonifer and Penicillium spp. were prevalent. The weevil Sitophilus zeamais and the larger grain borer Prostephanus truncatus were the most damaging. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests yielded fumonisins and aflatoxins ranging between 0.02 and 21.44 ppm, and 0.7 and 108.39 ppb in 96.4% and 21.4% of samples, respectively. Fumonisin was more pronounced in villages in forest areas whereas aflatoxin was highest in valley and forest areas in Zone II.

This method was successfully applied to analyze 180 veterinary drugs in milk, 220 pesticides in tomato and 50 mycotoxins in maize, respectively. Compared with the widely used approaches of data-dependent acquisition (DDA) or data-independent acquisition (DIA), the obtained results indicate that DDIA-based method combines the advantages of both DDA and DIA, since it achieves higher reproducibility of identification, lower false results for targeted compounds. Notably, the advantage of DDIA approach is that it enables better date retroactivity for untargeted compounds, such as metabolites and decomposition products. With the improvement in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) as well as data-mining techniques, we believe that DDIA data acquisition approach based on LC-HRMS will be widely applied in various fields in the near future, especially in compound screening and omics field, such as metabolomics and proteomics."

Thus, farmers have had to look for alternatives for pest control and use known insecticides or new substances reportedly less harmful to bees. We evaluated the oral acute toxicity of six insecticides (three of them systemic: imidacloprid, thiacloprid and sulfoxaflor) with four different modes of action on buff-tailed bumblebee workers (Bombus terrestris): two banned neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiacloprid), two pyrethroids (deltamethrin, esfenvalerate), one sulfoximine (sulfoxaflor) and a microbial insecticide based on Bacillus thuringiensis toxins, present in genetically modified (Bt) maize. The microbial insecticide only caused mortality to bumblebee workers at extremely high concentrations, so it is expected that Bt maize does not pose a risk to them. The toxicity of the other five insecticides on bumblebees was, from highest to lowest: imidacloprid, sulfoxaflor, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate and thiacloprid. This outcome suggests that certain insecticides in use are more toxic to B. terrestris than some banned neonicotinoids.

Bromodichloromethane has also been shown to increase liver and kidney tumours but this and bromoform have been shown to increase large intestinal tumours in rats. The weight of evidence is that they are only weak genotoxins and they do not appear to be active in vivo. It is probable that the mechanism for the liver and kidney tumours is the same as for chloroform but the mechanism for the large intestinal tumours is uncertain. However, the toxicity and carcinogenicity of these substances is profoundly affected by dosing in corn oil. New studies suggest that dosing in drinking water would not result in increases in tumours.

These low molecular weight compounds (usually less than 1000 Daltons) are naturally occurring and practically unavoidable. They can enter our food chain either directly from plant-based food components contaminated with mycotoxins or by indirect contamination from the growth of toxigenic fungi on food. Mycotoxins can accumulate in maturing corn, cereals, soybeans, sorghum, peanuts, and other food and feed crops in the field and in grain during transportation. Consumption of mycotoxin-contaminated food or feed can cause acute or chronic toxicity in human and animals. In addition to concerns over adverse effects from direct consumption of mycotoxin-contaminated foods and feeds, there is also public health concern over the potential ingestion of animal-derived food products, such as meat, milk, or eggs, containing residues or metabolites of mycotoxins. Members of three fungal genera, Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Penicillium, are the major mycotoxin producers. While over 300 mycotoxins have been identified, six (aflatoxins, trichothecenes, zearalenone, fumonisins, ochratoxins, and patulin) are regularly found in food, posing unpredictable and ongoing food safety problems worldwide. This review summarizes the toxicity of the six mycotoxins, foods commonly contaminated by one or more of them, and the current methods for detection and analysis of these mycotoxins."

In order to study a possible leaching of some of these herbicides into the aquifer, surface, and groundwater samples were collected in a watershed during the years of 1996 to 2003, from different locations. To detect and quantify the herbicides a GC-MS (gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry) method was used. The response of the herbicides analyzed was linear over the concentration range of 0.02 to 2.0 microg/L. Analysis of groundwater revealed that the herbicides tebuthiuron, diuron, atrazine, simazine, and ametryn were not present in the samples. In the surface water collected in 1997, ametryn was present in two out of nine locations with concentrations ranging from 0.17 and 0.23 microg/L, which is above the allowable 0.1 microg/L according to the European safety level.

Composting is a manure management practice wherein a carbon-rich bulking agent, such as corn (Zea mays L. ) stalk residue, is added to manure to achieve desirable carbon/nitrogen ratios to facilitate microbial activities and generate enough heat to inactivate pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant pathogens. However, when comparing compost piles and stockpiles for ARB reduction, we noticed that bulking agents added ARB to composting piles and compromised the performance of composting in reducing ARB. We hypothesized that ARB could be prevalent in corn stalk residues, a commonly used bulking agent for composting. To test this hypothesis, corn stalk residue samples throughout Nebraska were surveyed for the presence of ARB. Of the samples tested, 54% were positive for antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli or enterococci using direct plating or after enrichment. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend wherein the use of pesticides tended to result in a greater prevalence of some ARB. Results from this study suggest that bulking agents can be a source of ARB in manure composting piles and highlight the importance of screening bulking agents for effective ARB reduction in livestock manure during composting."

Analysis of nutritional data showed that the test flours contained similar amounts of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates as the commonly used dried maize-soy flour blends. All the test porridges were generally accepted by the mothers and children due to the unique smoky and roasted aroma, brown color and the sweeter flavor even without the addition of sugar. Grainy texture and the presence of residues were the only unacceptable attributes in some of the test porridges. In conclusion, fresh maize-soy floor blends can be potentially used in complementary feeding of children at home and school as an alternative to other traditional maize flours.

Several sequestering agents also can be added to diets to reduce mycotoxin levels, but their efficacy varies with the type and level of mycotoxin contamination. This article gives an overview of the types, prevalence, and levels of mycotoxin contamination in ensiled forages in different countries, and describes their adverse effects on health of ruminants, and effective prevention and mitigation strategies for dairy cow diets. Future research priorities discussed include research efforts to develop silage additives or rumen microbial innocula that degrade mycotoxins."

Besides being carcinogenic, they have other adverse health effects on humans and animals. In this preliminary study, we used two non-invasive optical techniques, optical fiber fluorescence spectroscopy and multispectral imaging (MSI), for discrimination of maize seeds naturally contaminated with aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) from the uncontaminated seeds. The AFB1-contaminated seeds exhibited a red shift of the emission maximum position compared to the control samples. Using linear discrimination analysis to analyse fluorescence data, classification accuracy of 100% was obtained to discriminate uncontaminated and AFB1-contaminated seeds. The MSI analysis combined with a normalized canonical discriminant analysis, provided spectral and spatial patterns of the analysed seeds. The AFB1-contaminated seeds showed a 7.9 to 9.6-fold increase in the seed reflectance in the VIS region, and 10.4 and 12.2-fold increase in the NIR spectral region, compared with the uncontaminated seeds. Thus the MSI method classified successfully contaminated from uncontaminated seeds with high accuracy.

Instead of a toxin-conjugate conventionally used in competitive immunoassays, we designed a ZEA mimicking peptide extended by a biotin-linker and confirmed its excellent suitability to mimic ZEA by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis.

The application of gaseous ozone was tested in different combinations of exposure time, ozone concentration, and canjiquinha mass. After the ozonation treatment, samples were collected for aflatoxin and microbiological analyses. Aflatoxins were evaluated using a high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD) system using pre-column derivatization, and the microbiological analyses were carried out for toxin-producer fungi and mesophilic bacteria. After ozone detoxification, results showed reductions up to 57% in aflatoxin levels.

Due to frequent occurrences associated with high levels of ZEN, maize oil is a particular source of exposure. Although a European maximum level for ZEN in maize oil exists according to Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1126/2007 along with a newly developed international standard method for analysis, certified reference materials (CRM) are still not available. To overcome this lack, the first CRM for the determination of ZEN in contaminated maize germ oil (ERM¬Æ-BC715) was developed in the frame of a European Reference Materials (ERM¬Æ) project according to the requirements of ISO Guide 35. The whole process of CRM development including preparation, homogeneity and stability studies, and value assignment is presented. The assignment of the certified mass fraction was based upon an in-house study using high-performance liquid chromatography isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry. Simultaneously, to support the in-house certification study, an interlaboratory comparison study was conducted with 13 expert laboratories using different analytical methods.

We employed principal component analysis (PCA), correlation analysis (CA), and spatial distribution to identify the source and distribution characteristics of HMs in soil. Health risks of HMs and exposure pathways were accessed by calculating the hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI). The Igeo, PI, and PN results show that cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) pollution is severe in soil, while other pollution is relatively little. PCA, CA, and spatial distribution show that HMs may be derived from black shale weathering and enrichment. Residents' drinking water is relatively safe. Arsenic is the element most threatening to local residents (HI = 3.8). Soil (HI = 3.55) ingestion and plant (HI = 1.67) ingestion are the primary exposure pathways to HMs. This unusual disease may be caused by children's relatively low immunity and long-term exposure to As.

The foliage-dwelling spider fauna of Bt maize fields and adjacent margins was monitored and compared to non-transgenic maize fields. The study took place during the vegetation seasons of 2001-2003 in Bavaria, South Germany. Maize fields and adjacent nettle field margins were colonized by a typical spider assemblage, dominated by space-web spiders (Theridiidae and Linyphiidae). Abundance and species richness of spiders was higher in nettle margins than in maize fields. The proportion of hunting spiders tended to be higher in nettle margins, whereas space-web spiders tended to be more frequent in maize fields. Bt maize showed no consistent effect on individual numbers, species richness and guild structure of spiders in maize fields and adjacent nettle field margin strips. The spider abundance was higher in Bt treatments in 2003, whereas in 2001 and 2002 no significant differences were found.

These results indicated that the use of chisel plow or conducting no tillage with straw returned to the soil, can reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions, and improve the economic benefits of summer maize production in the region, compared with conventional moldboard plow tillage without straw (which is typically burned off). The results show that further improvements could be facilitated by improving the utilization of nitrogen fertilizer, returning straw to the soil, and reducing tillage.

Most current studies have addressed the characterization of microplastics from the environment. For microplastics in food, most detections focused on liquid systems such as alcohol, beverages, etc. , while there has been quite rare research on microplastics in solid foods with complex matrices. Thus, this study attempted to use three molecular spectral imaging approaches, namely, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), optical photothermal resonance infrared (O-PTIR), and confocal Raman spectral imaging, combined with chemometrics to characterize the presence of microplastics in corn flour. The results demonstrated that O-PTIR imaging can rapidly sense the presence of microplastics, but its data integrity and visualization were limited. By decomposing the image, FTIR and Raman acquired a more integral distribution. Wherein, microplastics were well depicted by Raman imaging coupled with independent component analysis. Moreover, O-PTIR imaging can quickly detect contaminants at low concentrations but with a low detection rate. Raman imaging underperformed in low-concentration samples but provided a better visualization in mid-concentration samples. Overall, the results confirmed that the visual detection of microplastics in powdered food can be realized by molecular spectral imaging coupled with data mining, which can provide a reference for the detection of microplastics in other foods."

PCR products confirmed integration of the AGM182 gene, while RT-PCR of maize RNA confirmed the presence of AGM182 transcripts. Maize kernel screening assay using a highly aflatoxigenic A. flavus strain (AF70) showed up to 72% reduction in fungal growth in the transgenic AGM182 seeds compared to isogenic negative control seeds. Reduced fungal growth in the AGM182 transgenic seeds resulted in a significant reduction in aflatoxin levels (76-98%).

Therefore, total bacterial community structures may not be a sensitive indicator for providing evidence for the impact of insecticidal proteins on honeybees at sublethal levels."

The lower Shire AEZ is characterised by higher mean temperatures throughout the year and low erratic rainfall. However, total fumonisins did not show significant variation across AEZs, but all positive samples exceeded 150¬†¬µg/kg, required for tolerable daily intake of 1.0¬†¬µg/kg body weight per day, established by the European Food Safety Authority Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain.

Here, for the first time, the effects of PFOS on testicular signaling, such as gonadotropin, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor, and inhibins/activins were shown to be directly related to male subfertility. Sexually mature 8-wk-old CD1 male mice were administered by gavages in corn oil daily with 0, 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg PFOS for 7, 14, or 21 days. Serum concentrations of testosterone and epididymal sperm counts were significantly lower in the mice after 21 days of the exposure to the highest dose compared with the controls. The expression levels of testicular receptors for gonadotropin, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor 1 were considerably reduced on Day 21 in mice exposed daily to 10 or 5 mg/kg PFOS. The transcript levels of the subunits of the testicular factors (i. e. , inhibins and activins), Inha, Inhba, and Inhbb, were significantly lower on Day 21 of daily exposure to 10, 5, or 1 mg/kg PFOS. The mRNA expression levels of steroidogenic enzymes (i. e. , StAR, CYP11A1, CYP17A1, 3beta-HSD, and 17beta-HSD) were notably reduced.

Due to electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged cell wall, positively charged PS-NH2 association with the leaf surfaces was significantly more than negatively charged PS-COOH. The fraction of PS nanoplastics entry into the leaves could efficiently transfer to the vasculature mainly through stomatal opening and move down to the roots through vascular bundle. Meanwhile, the occurrence of aggregation limited the nanoplastic translocation to the roots, especially for PS-NH2 with larger aggregate sizes relative to PS-COOH.

","Maize-dependent populations in sub-Saharan Africa are continually exposed to aflatoxin poisoning owing to their regular consumption of this dietetic cereal. Being a staple in Kenyan households, consumption of maize-based meals is done almost daily, thereby exposing consumers to aflatoxicoses. This study assessed awareness levels, knowledge disparities, and perceptions regarding aflatoxin contamination at the post-harvest phase among farmers in the Rift Valley Region of Kenya. Households were randomly selected using a geographical positioning system (GPS) overlay of the agro-ecological zones within Uasin Gishu and Elgeyo Marakwet counties. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in 212 smallholder and large-scale farms. The study documented the demographic profiles of farmers and knowledge, awareness, and perceptions of aflatoxin contamination using a pre-designed structured questionnaire. Most farmers were familiar with aflatoxins and the adverse effects they present to health (61.32%). Almost all the farmers (94.37%) were aware of storage molds and food-spoilage fungi. However, few farmers adopted good post-harvest practices (PHPs), such as avoiding premature harvests (49.8%), using well-ventilated storage spaces (44.6%), grain sorting (30.5%), proper drying of maize (17.8%), and using hermetic bags for storage (30.5%). Conclusively, intensified farmer education is required to train farmers on good PHPs to protect their maize from aflatoxigenic fungi and aflatoxin accumulation."

The critical thresholds in soil were based on food quality criteria for Cd in crops or in organs of cattle (Bos taurus), and were calculated by inverting a regression model for the Cd concentration in the crop, with the Cd concentration in soil, soil organic matter (SOM) content, clay content, and pH as predictors. The probability of exceeding the critical threshold for Cd in soil per node of a 500- x 500-m grid was approximated by Monte Carlo simulation, using the estimated cumulative distribution functions (cdf) of SOM, clay, pH, and Cd as input. The cdfs were estimated by simple indicator kriging with local prior means. For SOM, clay, and pH, detailed maps of soil type and land use were used to define subregions with assumed constant local means of the indicators (a priori distributions). The cdfs were sampled by Latin hypercube sampling. We accounted for correlation between the actual and critical Cd concentrations in soil by drawing Cd values from cdfs conditional on SOM and clay. The estimated probability for grassland is negligible, even in areas with high Cd concentrations in soil, and for maize (Zea mays L. ) land the probability is almost everywhere smaller than 5%.

In recent years, they have been developed for agronomical purposes to target microbial pest such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Nanoparticles are also proposed to limit the use of pesticides, whose abuse is causing environmental impact and human health concerns. In this study, nanoparticles were obtained by using poly-(Œµ-caprolactone), a polyester chosen for its biocompatibility and biodegradability properties. Poly-(Œµ-caprolactone) nanoparticles were formulated by using poly(vinyl alcohol) or Pluronic¬Æ F127 as non-ionic surfactants, and then loaded with benzophenone or valerophenone thiosemicarbazone, two compounds that inhibit aflatoxin production by Aspergillus flavus. The different types of nanoparticles were compared in terms of size, polydispersity index, morphology, and drug loading capacity. Finally, their effects were investigated on growth, development, and aflatoxin production in the aflatoxigenic species Aspergillus flavus, a ubiquitous contaminant of maize, cereal crops, and derived commodities. Aflatoxin production was inhibited to various extents, but the best inhibitory effect was obtained with respect to sclerotia production that was most effectively suppressed by both benzophenone and valerophenone thiosemicarbazone-loaded nanoparticles. These data support the idea that it is possible to use such nanoparticles as an alternate to pesticides for the control of mycotoxigenic sclerotia-forming fungi."

Much less is known about the toxicity of its metabolite AFM1, which is secreted in the milk of mammals. Nonetheless, many nations have set regulatory limits for maximum allowable AFM1 in milk and other dairy products. We collected comprehensive data on the occurrence of AFM1 in samples of milk worldwide, encompassing a wide range of different milk types: raw, pasteurized, ultra-high-temperature treated, fresh, and powdered. For each nation, we found average daily milk intake based on national or global dietary surveys. We then used the AFM1 concentration data and intake rates to calculate AFM1 exposure for adults in multiple nations worldwide. Several nations including Pakistan, India, and several sub-Saharan African nations, had AFM1 levels in milk that substantially exceeded United States and European Union regulatory limits for AFM1, indicating potential risk to individuals in those nations with high milk consumption. Because no regulatory agency has set a tolerable daily intake (TDI) for AFM1, we could not compare our exposure estimates to a TDI to determine at-risk populations. But importantly, high AFM1 levels in milk indicate high levels of AFB1 in animal feed. This may imply that the crops used to make that feed such as maize, may have high AFB1 levels, which upon consumption could harm both animal and human health."

However, the mechanism of immunotoxicity, especially the immunosuppression induced by FB1 is still unclear. The most pivotal cells in the induction of immune responses are dendritic cells (DCs). In this study, we used murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) as a model system to elucidate the effect of FB1 on the function of BMDCs through biological methods. We found that FB1 reversed the morphological changes and enhanced the endocytosis of FITC-dextran in LPS-treated BMDCs. At the same time, FB1 decreased the LPS-induced expressions of MHC II, C[1]D80 and CD86 molecules in BMDCs (p<0.05), as well as the T-cell stimulatory capacity of BMDCs (p<0.01). Moreover, the secretions of IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12, but not TNF-Œ± induced by LPS exposure were suppressed by FB1 in a dose dependent (p<0.01).

This article explores material-semiotic translations to explain one of the central aspects of this project, the definition and circulation of Zapatista corn--an entity defined not only through cultural geography, but also technological means. Through its circulation, Zapatista corn serves to perform a biocultural engagement with Zapatista's political project of resistance to neoliberalism.

Electronic results indicate that aflatoxins in Uganda are produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus and have been reported in maize, sorghum, sesame, beans, sunflower, millet, peanuts, and cassava.

This study investigated the transfer of Cd (exogenous salts) from a wide range of Chinese soils to corn grain (Zhengdan 958). Through multiple stepwise regressions, prediction models were developed, with the combination of Cd bioconcentration factor (BCF) of Zhengdan 958 and soil pH, organic matter (OM) content, and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Moreover, these prediction models from Zhengdan 958 were applied to other non-model corn species through cross-species extrapolation approach. The results showed that the pH of the soil was the most important factor that controlled Cd uptake and lower pH was more favorable for Cd bioaccumulation in corn grain. There was no significant difference among three prediction models in the different Cd levels. When the prediction models were applied to other non-model corn species, the ratio ranges between the predicted BCF values and the measured BCF values were within an interval of 2 folds and close to the solid line of 1‚à∂1 relationship. Furthermore, these prediction models also reduced the measured BCF intra-species variability for all non-model corn species.

However, save for the cases of acute toxicity, the levels of sub-lethal exposure have not been adequately assessed. It is believed that this type of exposure does exist even during the seasons when acute toxicity does not occur. This study, therefore, was designed to assess the exposure of households to aflatoxins through consumption of maize and maize products. Twenty samples each of maize kernels, muthokoi and maize meal were randomly sampled from households in Kibwezi District of Makueni County in Eastern Kenya and analysed for aflatoxin contamination. The samples were quantitatively analysed for aflatoxin contamination using HPLC. The uncertainty and variability in dietary exposure was quantitatively modelled in Ms Excel using Monte Carlo simulation in @Risk software. Aflatoxins were found in 45% of maize kernels at between 18 and 480 Œºg kg‚Åª¬π, 20% of muthokoi at between 12 and 123 Œºg kg‚Åª¬π, and 35% of maize meal at between 6 and 30 Œºg kg‚Åª¬π.

Here, we investigated the role of soil microbes (SMs) to examine As phytoaccumulation using maize as a test plant, under varying sulfate levels (S-0, S-5, S-25¬†mmol¬†kg-1) and As stress. The addition of sulfate and SMs promoted maize plant growth and reduced As concentration in shoots compared to sulfate-treated plants without SMs. Results revealed that the¬†SMs-S-5 treatment proved to be the most promising in reducing As uptake by 27% and 48% in root and shoot of the maize plants, respectively.

Similarly, the antioxidant defense in maize plants was increased significantly in SMs-S-treated plants, notably with SMs-S-5 treatment. Overall, the SMs-S-5-treated plants possessed improved plant growth, dry biomass, physiology and antioxidant defense system and decrease in plant shoot As concentration. The outcomes of this study suggest that sulfate supplementation in soil along with SMs could assist in reducing As accumulation by maize plants, thus providing a sustainable and eco-friendly bioremediation strategy in limiting As exposure."

This research was undertaken to evaluate the effects of the natural phytochemicals trans-cinnamic acid (CA) and ferulic acid (FA) alone at concentrations of 20 to 30 mM and in 5 combinations on Aspergillus flavus Link and A. parasiticus Speare populations and aflatoxin B(1) production. Studies on Aspergillus population and aflatoxin B(1) production were carried out in maize grain in relation to a water activity a(w) of 0.99, 0.97, 0.95, and 0.93. CA and FA at concentrations of 25 to 30 mM, respectively, and CA-FA mixture T9 (25 + 30 mM) were the treatments most effective at inhibiting A. flavus and A. parasiticus population at all a(w) assayed after 11 d of incubation. At all a(w) values, the mixture CA-FA T9 (25 + 30 mM) completely inhibited (100%) aflatoxin B(1) production by both strains at a(w)= 0.99, 0.97, 0.95, and 0.93. Decreased aflatoxin B(1) levels in comparison with the control were observed with mixtures CA-FA T6 (10 + 25 mM), T7 (20 + 20 mM), and T8 (20 + 30 mM) of both strains in the majority of a(w) assayed. The data show that CA and FA could be considered as effective fungitoxicants for A. flavus and A. parasiticus in maize in the a(w) range 0.99 to 0.93. The information obtained shows promise for controlling aflatoxigenic fungi in stored maize."

This high-demand crop is susceptible to biological contamination with mycotoxins, which could represent a latent hazard for consumers. To assess the incidence of aflatoxins and fumonisins in grain, masa and tortilla, and the dietary exposure to these substances among consumers, a study was conducted in four municipalities in the department of Lempira. Total aflatoxin and fumonisin content were quantified by fluorometry in 144 samples from 48 farmers. Sixty five percent of the samples were contaminated with aflatoxins with levels of 1.28-32.05, 1.15 to 12.61, and 1.01-5.98 Œºg/kg in grain, masa and tortilla, respectively. Fumonisins were detected in 100% of the samples at levels between 0.82 and 28.04, 0.66 and 14.36, and 0.63 and 12.04 mg/kg in grain, masa and tortilla, respectively. The reduction in aflatoxin and fumonisin contamination after processing grains into tortillas was of 83% and 52%, respectively. The difference in aflatoxin and fumonisin concentration in the three products was significant (p < 0.05). With a per capita tortilla consumption of 490 g/day, dietary exposure was estimated between 0.003 and 0.073 Œºg/kg bw/day for aflatoxins and 6.16 and 151.98 Œºg/kg bw/day for fumonisins. Therefore, the risk of exposure to mycotoxins in the evaluated communities was considered high. Mixed effect models showed that postharvest grain management and the nixtamalization process affect the incidence of mycotoxins in corn-based products."

However, there are limited studies on the emission factors (EFs) and speciation profiles of I/SVOCs from household stoves burning biomass straw. In this study, experiments were conducted in a typical Chinese stove to test the EFs and species of I/SVOCs in three commonly used straws. It was revealed that EFs of I/SVOCs emitted from the burning of corn straw, rice straw, and wheat straw were 6.7, 1.9, and 9.8 g/kg, respectively, which accounted for 48.3 %, 36.8 %, and 48.6 % of total organic compounds emitted. Particulate organic compounds were dominated by ketones, oxygenated aromatics, acids, esters, and nitrogen-containing compounds, whereas the gaseous phase was dominated by aldehydes, acids, and aromatics. Although I/SVOCs only accounted for 18.1-23.6 % of the gaseous emissions from burning of straw, they represented 64.8-72.9 % of the secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAFP).

The compound is lipophilic and distributes rapidly to the brain but also clears rapidly and shows little evidence of accumulation. Limited studies in the literature report neurotoxicity of NBBS in rabbits and rats. Adult Sprague-Dawley male rats (Harlan) received corn oil vehicle or NBBS (100, 200, or 400mg/kg/d) via oral gavage (5 ml/kg bwt) daily/5d/week for 27 d. Deaths were observed in the 400mg/kg/d dose group in the first 5d and dosing was decreased to 300 mg/kg/d. No alterations were observed in gait, locomotor activity, and rearing behavior. No histological lesions were observed in the testis, seminal vesicles, coagulating gland, epididymis, and prostate. In the liver, minimal centrilobular hypertrophy was evident in all rats of the high dose group. Contrary to previous reports, there was no evidence of peripheral nerve lesions or gliosis in the hippocampus or cerebellum. mRNA levels for glial fibrillary acidic acid protein, interferon gamma, CXCR-3, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and CD11b were not altered in the hippocampus while Iba-1 levels were decreased. These data do not support previous reports of neurotoxicity for NBBS within a 4-week exposure regimen; however, neuropathological injury occurring over an extended period of exposure cannot be ruled out and given the potential for human exposure requires further examination."

Assessing the potential risk of fumonisin production in developing maize ears prior to harvest requires an understanding of the regulation of toxin biosynthesis during kernel maturation. We investigated the developmental-stage-dependent relationship between maize kernels and fumonisin B1 production by using kernels collected at the blister (R2), milk (R3), dough (R4), and dent (R5) stages following inoculation in culture at their respective field moisture contents with F. moniliforme. Highly significant differences (P </= 0.001) in fumonisin B1 production were found among kernels at the different developmental stages. The highest levels of fumonisin B1 were produced on the dent stage kernels, and the lowest levels were produced on the blister stage kernels. The differences in fumonisin B1 production among kernels at the different developmental stages remained significant (P </= 0.001) when the moisture contents of the kernels were adjusted to the same level prior to inoculation. We concluded that toxin production is affected by substrate composition as well as by moisture content. Our study also demonstrated that fumonisin B1 biosynthesis on maize kernels is influenced by factors which vary with the developmental age of the tissue. The risk of fumonisin contamination may begin early in maize ear development and increases as the kernels reach physiological maturity."

Parameters that were studied included processing time (0-60 min), processing temperature (100-235 degrees C), and buffer pH (4, 7, and 10). The rate and extent of fumonisin decomposition increased with processing temperature. Less than 27% of FB1 and less than 20% of FB2 were lost when processing temperatures were less than or equal to 125 degrees C for 60 min. After 60 min at 150 degrees C, losses of FB1 and FB2 were 80-90% at pH 4, 18-30% at pH 7, and 40-52% at pH 10. At temperatures greater than or equal to 175 degrees C, more than 80% of FB1 and FB2 was lost after 60 min.

In plants, phenolamides are involved in biotic stress response. The data on variations of phenolamides in AFB1-containing seeds are limited. RESULTS:Five polyamine conjugates, including two spermidine and three putrescine conjugates, were tentatively identified in methanolic extracts, using HPLC-DAD-MS. The ratio of putrescine to spermidine conjugates changed with increasing AFB1 concentration in a logistic dose-response manner, with a ratio of below 1 up to a concentration of 51.51‚ÄâŒºg‚Äâkg-1 , and approximately 2.54 and 3 at higher concentrations of 177.4 and 308.13‚ÄâŒºg‚Äâkg-1 , respectively. The observed variations of the total antioxidant activity and the total phenolic content may support this biphasic behaviour of the seeds against AFB1 stress. CONCLUSIONS:The obtained data are a contribution to the understanding of the roles of polyamine conjugates in seed defence to increasing AFB1 concentrations. According to our knowledge, this study reports for the first time the biphasic response of maize seeds to increasing AFB1 contamination level, comprising the induction of polyamine conjugate accumulation and variation in the ratio of conjugates.

However, cotyledons behaved in an opposite manner. Moreover, exogenous applications of NO and H2S to Cr-stressed maize seedlings triggered a significant response, involving the virtual restoration of the values for all these activities to those observed in unstressed seedlings, although their specific impact on ROS and NADPH-recycling metabolisms depends on the seedling organ involved. Taken together, the data indicate that gas transmitters, NO and H2S, which act as a defence against the negative effects of hexavalent chromium contamination, are alternative compounds with potential biotechnological applications."

This threat is caused either by the direct contamination of agricultural commodities or by a ""carry-over"" of mycotoxins and their metabolites into animal tissues, milk, and eggs after feeding of contaminated hay or corn. As a consequence of their diverse chemical structures and varying physical properties, mycotoxins exhibit a wide range of biological effects. Individual mycotoxins can be genotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, and oestrogenic. To protect consumer health and to reduce economic losses, surveillance and control of mycotoxins in food and feed has become a major objective for producers, regulatory authorities and researchers worldwide. However, the variety of chemical structures makes it impossible to use one single technique for mycotoxin analysis. Hence, a vast number of analytical methods has been developed and validated. The heterogeneity of food matrices combined with the demand for a fast, simultaneous and accurate determination of multiple mycotoxins creates enormous challenges for routine analysis. The most crucial issues will be discussed in this review. These are (1) the collection of representative samples, (2) the performance of classical and emerging analytical methods based on chromatographic or immunochemical techniques, (3) the validation of official methods for enforcement, and (4) the limitations and future prospects of the current methods."

The African climate and subsistence farming techniques favour the growth of AF-producing fungal genera particularly in maize, which is a food staple commonly associated with mycotoxin contamination. Predictive models are useful tools in the management of mycotoxin risk. Mycotoxin climate risk predictive models have been successfully developed in Australia, the USA, and Europe, but are still in their infancy in Africa. This review aims to investigate whether AFs' occurrence in African maize can be effectively mitigated in the face of increasing climate change and food insecurity using climate risk predictive studies. A systematic search is conducted using Google Scholar. The complexities associated with the development of these prediction models vary from statistical tools such as simple regression equations to complex systems such as artificial intelligence models. Africa's inability to simulate a climate mycotoxin risk model in the past has been attributed to insufficient climate or AF contamination data.

Additionally, they significantly limit the development of international trade as a result of strict regulation in high-value markets. Due to their high stability, aflatoxins are not only a problem during cropping, but also during storage, transport, processing, and handling steps. Consequently, innovative evidence-based technologies are urgently required to minimize aflatoxin exposure. Thus far, biological control has been developed as the most innovative potential technology of controlling aflatoxin contamination in crops, which uses competitive exclusion of toxigenic strains by non-toxigenic ones. This technology is commercially applied in groundnuts maize, cottonseed, and pistachios during pre-harvest stages. Some other effective technologies such as irradiation, ozone fumigation, chemical and biological control agents, and improved packaging materials can also minimize post-harvest aflatoxins contamination in agricultural products.

These increases might trigger the requirement for additional energy consumption for water treatment to remove the nitrates. While these increasing concentrations of nitrate might pose a human health concern, most water resources were found to be within current maximum contaminant level (MCL) limits of 10 mg L(-1) NO(3)-N. When water resources exceed this MCL, energy-intensive drinking water treatment is required to reduce nitrate levels below 10 mg L(-1). Based on prior estimates of water supplies currently exceeding the nitrate MCL, we calculate that advanced drinking water treatment might require an additional 2360 million kWh annually (for nitrate affected areas only)--a 2100% increase in energy requirements for water treatment in those same areas--to mitigate nitrate contamination and meet the MCL requirement. We predict that projected increases in nitrate contamination in water may impact the energy consumed in the water treatment sector, because of the convergence of several related trends: (1) increasing cornstarch-based ethanol production, (2) increasing nutrient loading in surface water and groundwater resources as a consequence of increased corn-based ethanol production, (3) additional drinking water sources that exceed the MCL for nitrate, and (4) potentially more stringent drinking water standards for nitrate."

Fumonisins are a group of polyketide-derived secondary metabolites linked to esophageal cancer and neural tube birth defects in humans and numerous toxicoses in livestock. Despite the importance of fumonisins in global maize production, the regulation of fumonisin biosynthesis during kernel pathogenesis is poorly understood. The HAP complex is a conserved, heterotrimeric transcriptional regulator that binds the consensus sequence CCAAT to modulate gene expression. Recently, functional characterization of the Hap3 subunit linked the HAP complex to the regulation of secondary metabolism and stalk rot pathogenesis in F. verticillioides. Here, we determine the involvement of HAP3 in fumonisin biosynthesis and kernel pathogenesis. Deletion of HAP3 suppressed fumonisin biosynthesis on both nonviable and live maize kernels and impaired pathogenesis in living kernels. Transcriptional profiling via RNA sequencing indicated that the HAP complex regulates at least 1,223 genes in F. verticillioides , representing nearly 10% of all predicted genes. Disruption of the HAP complex caused the misregulation of biosynthetic gene clusters underlying the production of secondary metabolites, including fusarins. Taken together, these results reveal that the HAP complex is a central regulator of fumonisin biosynthesis and kernel pathogenesis and works as both a positive and negative regulator of secondary metabolism in F. verticillioides."

Aflatoxins have been detected in surface, wastewater and drinking water, including tap and bottled water. The specific sources of water contamination remain unclear, which is an important gap that must be addressed in future research. Two main kinds of decontamination methods have been reported, including degradation and adsorption. The best degradation rates were observed using gamma and UV irradiations, oxidoreductases and ozone, while the best adsorption abilities were observed with minerals, polyvinyl alcohol, durian peel and activated carbon. Synthetic polymers could be used as membranes in pipes to remove aflatoxins in water flows. Although most decontamination methods were screened using AFB1, the other commonly found aflatoxins were not used in the screenings. Overall, the occurrence of aflatoxins in water could be a significant emerging public health concern largely ignored by local and international legislation. Numerous advances have been reported for the decontamination of aflatoxins in water; however, there is still a long way to go to put them into practice."

The strains were isolated using culture-dependent methods, identified through 16S rDNA gene sequencing, and characterized with respect to their functional traits related to plant growth promotion and resistance to metals and antibiotics. The bioremediation capacity of the rhizobacteria was determined in greenhouse using corn plants. The isolated bacteria belonged to the phyla Actinobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, with great abundance of the species Microbacterium trichothecenolyticum. The rhizobacteria abundance, richness, and diversity were greater in mercury-contaminated soils. Bacteria isolated from contaminated environments had higher minimum inhibitory concentration values, presented plasmids and the merA gene, and were multi-resistant to metals and antibiotics. Enterobacter sp. _C35 and M. trichothecenolyticum_C34 significantly improved (Dunnett's test, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) corn plant growth in mercury-contaminated soil. These bacteria helped to reduce up to 87% of the mercury content in the soil, and increased the mercury bioaccumulation factor by up to 94%.

In addition, crops are the first trophic level in the human food chain, and the security and production of crops are closely related to human well-being. The objective of this study was to estimate the phytotoxicities of agricultural soil samples contaminated by coal gangue accumulation using maize (Zea mays L. ) as a model organism. Finally, a tolerant maize cultivar was screened for coal gangue stacking areas. Seven cultivars of maize seeds were treated with agricultural soil leachate around the coal gangue stacking area at various concentrations of 0, 1:27, 1:9, 1:3, and 1:1. The results revealed that the agricultural soil leachate treatment could inhibit seed germination and the growth of roots and shoots and that the soil leachate-induced phytotoxicities were cultivar-dependent. At the same exposure concentration, tolerant maize cultivar displayed lower toxicity symptoms than sensitive maize cultivar in terms of growth inhibition, oxidative damage, and DNA damage. Stronger activities of antioxidant enzymes were observed in the tolerant maize cultivar than in the sensitive maize cultivar, indicating that the difference between cultivars in antioxidant capacity is one reason for the difference in plant tolerance. Our study provides experimental evidence for the ecological risk assessment of soil and the selection of maize cultivars with high environmental pollutant tolerance for use in coal gangue stacking areas."

The maizes were treated with leachate at levels of 2%, 10%, 20%, 30% or 50% (V/V). First, the change of physiological indexes, including chlorophyll (Chl), Malondialdehyde (MDA) and Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, combined with yield all showed that soaking with leachate, but not germination, generated a greater ecological risk on maize. After a soaking treatment of maize with 50% leachate, the Chl, MDA and ROS levels during a vigorous growth period were 47.3%, 149.8% and 309.7%, respectively, of the control, whereas the yield decreased to 68.6% of the control. In addition, our results demonstrated that the leachate at lower levels could promote growth. This is mainly embodied in that the yield of maize treated with 10% leachate at the soaking stage increased to 116.0% of the control. Moreover, the cytological analysis experiment also demonstrated that the ecological risk of leachate still exists in both cases. Furthermore, the gray relational analysis showed that the ear row number and tassel branch number were the major factors affecting the yield of maize treated with 50% leachate at the stages of soaking and germination, respectively. In general, these results are helpful in understanding the phytotoxicity of leachate, which provides additional reference data for risk assessment and management of leachate."

The results showed that mining activities, sewage irrigation, industrial activities and agricultural practices were the critical factors causing Cd accumulation in wheat and maize cultivated sites. Thereinto, mining activities contributed to a higher Cd accumulation risk in the southwest China and Middle Yellow River regions; sewage irrigation influenced the Cd accumulation in the North China Plain. In addition, the investigated sites were classified into different categories by comparing their soil and grain Cd contents with the Chinese soil screening values and food safety values, respectively. Cd enrichment models were developed to predict the Cd levels in wheat and maize grains. The results showed that the models exhibited a good performance for predicting the grain Cd contents among safe and warning sites of wheat (R2¬†=¬†0.61 and 0.72, respectively); while the well-fitted model for maize was prone to the overestimated sites (R2¬†=¬†0.77).

However, the significance of the processing environment in the contamination of frozen foods is not well established. This study aimed to identify potential contamination niches of L. monocytogenes in a frozen processing plant and characterize the recovered isolates. A frozen vegetable processing plant was monitored before cleaning activities. A total of 78 points were sampled, including frozen vegetables.

In view of the limitations of available dietary exposure data on ZEN and its modified forms, the purpose of this review is to provide an overview of recent studies utilizing HBM to monitor and assess human exposure to ZEN. Considerations are given to animal and human toxicokinetic data relevant to HBM, analytical methods, and available HBM data on urinary biomarkers of ZEN exposure in different cohorts."

Phytoextraction, due to its low cost, applicability, and environmental friendliness, is considered a new technology for clean-up of heavy metal contamination in the environment. However, the low bioavailability of Hg in polluted areas greatly limits the applicability of phytoextraction. Here, we compared the effects of six common chelating ligands on the absorption and transport of Hg in maize (Zea mays L. ), which has a high biomass and short growth cycle. The results showed that the root length and biomass of maize seedlings of the groups treated with the six chelating ligands (EDTA, iodide, ammonium, thiosulfate, thiocyanate, and thiocarbamide) did not change compared with those of the non-treated groups. Co-exposure to Hg and each chelating ligand markedly alleviated the inhibitory effect induced by Hg. Iodide treatment resulted in the lowest root Hg content and highest translocation factor (TF) value, while ammonium treatment gave rise to the highest shoot Hg concentration and lowest TF. Compared with other chelating ligands, thiosulfate exhibited the maximum alleviation of Hg toxicity and achieved the highest concentration of Hg in the roots and aerial parts. Moreover, the TF and Hg accumulation in the thiosulfate and Hg co-exposed group were much higher than those in the group exposed to Hg alone. This finding suggests that, among these common chelating ligands, thiosulfate compounds have great potential for Hg phytoextraction, while the others can immobilize Hg in polluted areas."

In order to provide valuable health-related information to consumers, the nutritional and physicochemical characteristics of raw and boiled purple sweet corn juices were herein investigated. Sugars, antinutrients, total free phenols, anthocyanins, and antioxidant activity were analyzed by conventional chemical methods. The viscosity and stability of juices were determined by Ubbelohde viscosity meter and centrifugation, respectively. Boiling process could elevate viscosity, stability and sugar content, and reduce antinutrients, total free phenols, anthocyanins, and antioxidant activity in corn juice. In addition, short time boiling efficiently reduced the degradation of anthocyanins during subsequent refrigeration. The content of amino acids, vitamin B1/B2 and E were detected by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry was used for the analysis of fatty acids and aroma compounds. Several aroma compounds not previously reported in corn were identified, including 1-heptanol, 2-methyl-2-butenal, (Z)-3-nonen-1-ol, 3-ethyl-2-methyl-1,3-hexadiene, and 2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)phenol. Interestingly, the boiling process had no apparent effect on the amino acids profile, but it caused a 45.8% loss of fatty acids in the juice by promoting the retention of fatty acids in the corn residue. These results provide detailed information that could be used for increasing consumers' knowledge of sweet corn juice, further development of sweet corn juice by food producers, and maize breeding programs."

As well as assesseing the impacts on human health risk caused by bioavailability of nickel. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted for 30 days to determine the effect of biochar and lime on soil physicochemical properties and nickel bioavailability. Afterwards, a laboratory test was carried out to determine the repercussions of both amendments on soil resistance to re-acidification and re-mobilization of nickel. Human health risk was determined using nickle bioavailable concentration. Overall, the results of this study showed that biochar application significantly reduced soil acidity from 8.2 ¬± 0.8 meq 100 g-1 to 1.9 ¬± 0.3 meq 100 g-1, this reduction markedly influenced the bioavailability of nickel, which decreased significantly. Moreover, soil physicochemical properties and soil resistance to acidification were improved. Furthermore, biochar significantly reduced human health risk compared to lime application, even under a re-acidification scenario. It was possible to verify that Ni immobilization in the soil was increased when biochar was used. Soil Ni immobilization is associated with co-precipitation and chemisorption. Hence, it was demonstrated that biochar is more effective than lime in reducing soil acidity and remedying nickel-contaminated agricultural soils."

However, using Cry protein susceptible hosts as prey often compromises such studies. To avoid this problem we utilized pest Lepidoptera, cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), that were resistant to Cry1Ac produced in Bt broccoli (T. ni), Cry1Ac/Cry2Ab produced in Bt cotton (T. ni), and Cry1F produced in Bt maize (S. frugiperda).

There were no differences in any of the fitness parameters regardless if C. rufilabris consumed prey (T. ni or S. frugiperda) that had consumed Bt or non-Bt plants. Additional studies confirmed that the prey contained bioactive Cry proteins when they were consumed by the predator.

Using a modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extraction combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS), a rapid, sensitive, efficient, and reliable method for extraction and quantitative analysis of thifluzamide residues in maize grain, maize plant, and soil was developed. Satisfactory recoveries of 78.7-97.0% were achieved with relative standard deviations (RSDs) in the range of 1.6 to 8.2%. The limits of detection (LODs) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.002-0.005 and 0.010¬†mg¬†kg-1, respectively. The dissipation kinetics of thifluzamide in maize plant was well fitted by the first-order kinetic model with short half-lives of 0.19-0.22¬†days, while thifluzamide degraded slowly in soil with half-lives of 4.56-15.85¬†days. The final residues in maize grain, maize plant, and soil samples collected at the milk stage and the physiological maturity stage were no more than 0.010, 0.807, and 0.278¬†mg¬†kg-1, respectively. Given that no maximum residue limit (MRL) for thifluzamide in maize has been established, the safety of this fungicide application was estimated by a dietary risk assessment. The hazard¬†quotient was 0.03%, which was substantially less than 1, indicating that the long-term¬†risk induced by the thifluzamide application on maize at the recommended dose is negligible. These results help governments to develop regulations for the safe use of thifluzamide."

In this study the transfer of Pb (exogenous salts) was investigated from a wide range of Chinese soils to corn grain (Zhengdan 958). Prediction models were developed with combination of the Pb bioconcentration factor (BCF) of Zhengdan 958, and soil pH, organic matter (OM) content, and cation exchange capacity (CEC) through multiple stepwise regressions. Moreover, these prediction models from Zhengdan 958 were applied to other non-model corn species through cross-species extrapolation approach. The results showed that the soil pH and OM were the major factors that controlled Pb transfer from soil to corn grain. The lower pH and OM could improve the bioaccumulation of Pb in corn grain. No significant differences were found between two prediction models derived from the different exogenous Pb contents. When the prediction models were applied to other non-model corn species, the ratio ranges between the predicted BCF values and the measured BCF values were within an interval of 2-fold and close to the solid line of 1‚à∂1 relationship. Moreover, the prediction model i. e. Log[BCF]‚Ää=‚Ää-0.098 pH-0.150 log[OM] -1.894 at the treatment of high Pb can effectively reduce the measured BCF intra-species variability for all non-model corn species. These suggested that this prediction model derived from the high Pb content was more adaptable to be applied to other non-model corn species to predict the Pb bioconcentration in corn grain and assess the ecological risk of Pb in different agricultural soils."

To date, almost no review has addressed the toxicity of FBs in relation to oxidative stress and their metabolism. The focus of this article is primarily intended to summarize the progress in research associated with oxidative stress as a plausible mechanism for FB-induced toxicity as well as the metabolism. The present review showed that studies have been carried out over the last three decades to elucidate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress as a result of FBs treatment and have correlated them with various types of FBs toxicity, indicating that oxidative stress plays critical roles in the toxicity of FBs. The major metabolic pathways of FBs are hydrolysis, acylation and transamination. Ceramide synthase, carboxylesterase FumD and aminotransferase FumI could degrade FB1 and FB2. The cecal microbiota of pigs and alkaline processing such as nixtamalization can also transform FB1 into metabolites. Most of the metabolites of FB1 were less toxic than FB1, except its partial (pHFB1) metabolites. Further understanding of the role of oxidative stress in FB-induced toxicity will throw new light on the use of antioxidants, scavengers of ROS, as well as on the blind spots of metabolism and the metabolizing enzymes of FBs. The present review might contribute to reveal the toxicity of FBs and help to protect against their oxidative damage."

Abundance and diversity of aflatoxin producing Aspergillus flavus account for accumulation of the toxins in crops, which has been a persistent threat for public health and economy in tropical developing countries. A study was conducted to investigate occurrence and level of A. flavus and relate them to aflatoxin level in maize in Kenya and Tanzania. A total of 786 maize samples were collected at harvesting in selected areas of the two countries for the analysis. Fungal abundance in the samples was expressed as amount of fungal DNA relative to maize DNA. The fungal DNA was quantified by qPCR, targeting internal transcribed space (ITS) gene whereas in maize DNA was quantified through alpha-tubulin gene. The two genes are known to be conserved. Aflatoxins were quantified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography, coupled to ultra-high sensitivity, ultra-fast triple quadrupole, tandem-mass spectrophotometer. A flavus was detected in 88.5% of 786 tested samples and average fungal load for the samples (log host/pathogen ratio) was 5.53. Aflatoxin occurrence was positive in 31.9% of the samples at an average level of 2.3‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.643 ppb. There was a positive relationship between occurrence and level if the aflatoxin B 1 and presence and biomass of A. flavus was proved statistically. The findings of this study intensify the need to give substantial attention on preharvest control of A. flavus in cereal fields as an effort of controlling accumulation of aflatoxin B 1 in foods."

The resultant QBs, with approximately 2800 times brighter luminescence than the corresponding QDs, were explored as novel fluorescent probes in the immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for sensitive and quantitative detection of zearalenone (ZEN) in corns. Various parameters that influenced the sensitivity and stability of QB-based ICA (QB-ICA) were investigated and optimized. The optimal QB-ICA exhibits good dynamic linear detection for ZEN over the range of 0.125 ng/mL to 10 ng/mL with a median inhibitory concentration of 1.01¬±0.09 ng/mL (n=3). The detection limits for ZEN in a standard solution and real corn sample (dilution ratio of 1:30) are 0.0625 ng/mL and 3.6 ¬µg/kg, respectively, which is much better than that of a previously reported gold nanoparticle-based ICA method. Forty-six natural corn samples are assayed using both QB-ICA and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The two methods show a highly significant correlation (R(2)=0.92). Nine ZEN-contaminated samples were further confirmed with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the QB-ICA results also exhibited good agreement with LC-MS/MS method.

This study evaluated the comparative efficiency of rice straw (RSB), rice hull (RHB) and maize stover (MSB) derived biochar (BC) on Cd mobility and its accumulation in Chinese cabbage (Brassica chinensis L. ), which is highly Cd accumulating crop. Results showed that the soil chemical properties (pH, organic carbon and nutrients) significantly increased with increasing the biochar application rate from 1.5% to 3%. Concentration of Cd decreased in CaCl2 extract by 58.6, 39.7 and 46.49% and in toxicity characteristics leaching test (TCLP) by 42.9, 32.7 and 36.7% for RSB, RHB and MSB, respectively at 3% application rate. The simple bioaccessibility extraction test (SBET) techniques showed a significant decrease in Cd by 30.5, 20.6 and 27.5% for RSB, RHB and MSB, respectively at the 3% application rate. Moreover, the Cd contents in the cabbage shoots decreased by 25, 21.3 and 23.1% for RSB, RHB and MSB at a 3% application rate and in the roots by 31.3, 23.9 and 26.5% for RSB, RHB and MSB at a 3% application rate, respectively. Bioaccumulation (BCF) and translocation factors (TF) were significantly decreased upto 26.5% and 11%, respectively among all biochar types. Overall, RSB demonstrated positive results as soil amendments for Cd immobilization and thereby, reducing its bioavailability in the Cd contaminated soil to mitigate food security risks."

The sustainability of Bt crops is important, because their use has significantly reduced the amount of chemical insecticides necessary to control agricultural pests. Despite the high adoption rates of this novel insecticide, little is known about the aquatic fate of transgenic Bt proteins and their nontarget effects on aquatic invertebrates, although several potential routes exist for their transport to aquatic systems. Methods were developed to investigate the aquatic fate of transgenic Bt proteins and to determine their potential effects on nontarget aquatic invertebrates. Laboratory microcosms containing pond water only or pond water and sediment were used to examine the fate of the coleopteran-active Bt Cry3Bb1 protein in decomposing transgenic corn event MON863 (hereafter referred to as MON863 corn) leaf, stalk, and root. A half-life of less than 3 d was found for Bt Cry3Bb1 from decomposing MON863 corn residue. No Bt Cry3Bb1 was measured in the pond water or sediment extracts of microcosms containing MON863 corn. In an acute, static, partial-renewal toxicity test, Bt Cry3Bb1 protein from MON863 root extracts was fed to Chironomus dilutus larvae for 10 d.

Hence, prevention of AFs in food and feed is now considered more important than the subsequent interventions to mitigate the deleterious health effects of AFs in human and animals. However, the development of an effective preventive strategy hinges on a clear understanding of the underlying factors influencing AFs production. Therefore, the present review aims to highlight the most significant factors influencing AFs contamination of cereals at pre-and post-harvest stages. This is crucial for effective monitoring of critical control points and optimisation of preventive strategies in food and feed supply chains. Several intrinsic and extrinsic factors have been reported of which nutritional composition, environmental factors (temperature, water activity and relative humidity) and climate change have been identified as primary factors, while pH of the substrate, carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the gaseous environment, and agronomic and socioeconomic status are the main secondary factors promoting AFs biosynthesis in cereals.

A field experiment was therefore conducted to analyze the PA contents in the tissues of maize (Zea mays L. ) plants grown on slash-and-burn and slash-and-mulch plots, previously dominated with Chromolaena odorata, using liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC-ESI-MS/MS).

The active site of Os79 lies in a groove between the N-terminal acceptor and the C-terminal donor-binding domains. Structural alignments reveal that Os79 likely utilizes a catalytic mechanism similar to those of other plant UGTs, with His 27 activating the trichothecene O3 hydroxyl for nucleophilic attack at C1' of the UDP-glucose donor. Kinetic analysis of mutant Os79 revealed that Thr 291 plays a critical role in catalysis as a catalytic acid or to position the UDP moiety during the nucleophilic attack. Steady-state kinetic analysis demonstrated that Os79 conjugates multiple trichothecene substrates such as DON, nivalenol, isotrichodermol, and HT-2 toxin, but not T-2 toxin.

Corn straw- or bamboo-derived biochar pyrolyzed at 300‚ÄØ¬∞C and 700‚ÄØ¬∞C (CB300 or BB700), respectively, was amended into flooded PAH-contaminated soil. After harvest, 2% CB300, 0.5% BB700 or 2% BB700 amendments reduced the bioaccumulation of PAHs in rice root, especially that of high-molecular-weight PAHs (p‚ÄØ<.05). Total PAH concentrations were higher, and their bioavailable concentrations were lower in BB700-amended soils than the control. The stimulation of PAH desorption from BB by low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) was gentle and did not significantly retard the adsorption of PAHs on BB700, indicating that BB700 reduced PAH bioavailability primarily via immobilization. The total and bioavailable concentrations of PAHs were both lower in the 2% CB300-treated soils than the control. LMWOAs facilitated PAH release from CB300-amended soils, thus increasing the bioavailability of immobilized PAHs. The relative abundances of the bacteria, functional genes, and methanogens involved in PAH anaerobic degradation were significantly higher in the 2% CB300 treatment than other treatments. Fast PAH dissipation in soil amended with 2% CB300 may be attributed to the increased bioavailability of immobilized PAHs and enhanced biodegradation, both of which were induced by LMWOAs and CB. In summary, biochar types and root presence jointly affected the mechanisms by which biochar reduced the bioaccumulation of PAHs in rice under anaerobic conditions."

Thus, animal feed safety is an important regulatory concern. The aim of this study was to optimise a multiresidue method for the simultaneous analysis of multi-class pesticides and a number of frequently used veterinary drugs using LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS. The method was validated in a range of feed matrices, including maize feed, poultry feed and mixed feed concentrate. The optimised sample preparation workflow involved extraction of feeds (5¬†g) with ethyl acetate (10¬†mL), followed by a freezing step (at -20¬∞C) used for eliminating the matrix co-extractives. The extract was further cleaned by dispersive solid phase extraction with a combination of primary secondary amine, C18 and florisil sorbents. From the cleaned-extract, an aliquot was analysed by GC-MS/MS, while another portion of it was solvent-exchanged to acetonitrile:water (50:50) and then analysed by LC-MS/MS. This method effectively minimised the matrix interferences. A total of 192 pesticides was analysed by GC-MS/MS within a runtime of 22¬†min. The LC-MS/MS method was validated for 187 compounds including 17 veterinary drugs. For most of the compounds, the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.01¬†mg/kg. The recoveries at LOQ and higher levels ranged between 70% and 120%, with precision-RSDs of < 20%. The method provided a precise analysis in a wide range of market-feed samples.

Maize was grown to maturity and its HM concentrations and associated health risk indices were calculated. All soil amendments decreased bioavailable soil Pb concentrations by 29-36%, but only CM decreased Zn, while the amendments increased or had no effect on Cd concentrations compared to the control. The amendments reduced Pb (>25%) and Zn concentrations (>18%) in the maize stover and grain. However, Cd concentrations in maize grain increased in the BF and TSP treatments. Bioaccumulation factors showed that Cd had the highest mobility from the soil into maize stover and grain, indicating the need for greater attention on Cd in Kabwe despite its apparently lower soil concentration compared to Pb and Zn. The hazard quotients for Pb and Cd were much greater than one, indicating a high risk of possible exposure to toxic levels by people consuming maize grain grown in this area.

The NBFR concentrations in the YRB were 90.9 pg L-1 in water, 21.1 pg g-1 dw in soil and 3.81 pg g-1 dw in maize. Positive correlations were observed between soil and maize contamination in the five irrigated districts, indicating a potential threat to grain security and human health risks caused by OCPs and NBFRs. Pollutants detected in soil and maize primarily originated from historical use (36.3 %), while the sources in water were more complex (64.4 %) and new inputs could not be excluded.

Over the 29-year period surveyed, no yield reduction was observed when wireworm plant damage was below 15¬†% of the stand. A preliminary univariate analysis of risk assessment was applied to identify the main factors influencing the occurrence of damage. A multifactorial model was then applied by using the significant factors identified. This model allowed the research to highlight the strongest factors and to analyse how the main factors together influenced damage risk. The strongest factors were: A. brevis as prevalent damaging species, soil organic matter content >5¬†%, rotation including meadows and/or double crops, A. sordidus as prevalent damaging species, and surrounding landscape mainly meadows, uncultivated grass and double crops. The multifactorial model also showed how the simultaneous occurrence of two or more of the aforementioned risk factors can conspicuously increase the risk of wireworm damage to maize crops, while the probability of damage to a field with no-risk factors is always low (<1¬†%).

Process of materials exchange during oxidation was interfered by soil, resulting in insufficient degradation of 17Œ≤-E2, but the active species involved in 17Œ≤-E2 degradation would also be enriched by it. 17Œ≤-E2 was adsorbed on the VOX-CNT surface and directly degraded mainly by the active species generated on the catalyst surface, and ‚Ä¢OH dominated the degradation of 17Œ≤-E2 in VOX-CNT/PDS system. CO, defective sites and vanadium oxides on the surface of VOX-CNT contributed to the generation of activate species.

The ecotoxicological impact on soil caused by VOX-CNT/PDS was acceptable, and would be weakened with time. Additionally, a rapid decrease in the concentration of 17Œ≤-E2 and the promotion of maize growth were observed with VOX-CNT/PDS in situ pilot-scale remediation.

Sensitive and reliable quantification of ZEN in food is critical to ensure food safety and safeguard agricultural production. Herein, by combining the metal-organic frameworks-based nanozyme (MOFzyme) and hyaluronic acid (HA)-DNA hydrogel, a well-designed colorimetric aptasensor was developed. The HA-DNA hydrogel was deposited on the surface of the bimetallic MOFzyme via strand-induced hybridization chain reaction (HCR). Relying on the ZEN-specific aptamer integrated in hydrogel structure, the disintegration of the hydrogel network and the concomitant exposure of the encapsulated MOFzyme could be specifically triggered by the introduction of ZEN molecules. Moreover, the magnitude of hydrogel disintegration was positively correlated with the amount of ZEN, by which the quantification of ZEN can be effortlessly achieved. Benefiting from the delicate design, the satisfactory catalytic performance and stability of bimetallic MOFzyme and the appealing stimuli-responsiveness of DNA hydrogel, the developed aptasensor demonstrated superior analytical performance and ease of use. Under optimal conditions, the linear range of the aptasensor fell between 0.001 and 200¬†ng¬†mL-1 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.8¬†pg¬†mL-1.

Contamination data was provided by a wide survey where 928 individual samples were pooled to analyse 370 composite samples. Fumonisins were extracted and purified using immunoaffinity columns and determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. The raw consumption data came from a nutritional study specifically designed to assess the dietary intake of the main foodstuffs related to fumonisin contamination for all population age groups. In addition, two specific groups were selected with respect to maize consumption: immigrants and celiac sufferers. Contamination and consumption data were combined by simulation using an essentially parametric-parametric (P-P) method. The P-P method draws sampling values from distribution functions fitted to consumption and contamination datasets. Moreover, to quantify the accuracy and reliability of the statistical estimates, we built related confidence intervals using a Pseudo-Parametric bootstrap method. The results of this study show that fumonisins are commonly found in some commodities on the Catalonian market, such as beer, corn snacks and ethnic foods; however, the values were well below the permitted maximum EU levels. The most exposed group were infants followed by immigrants but, in all cases, they were below the TDI of 2‚Äâ¬µg/kg bw/day."

Such analyses are typically conducted by a narrowly-focused group of scientific experts using technical information. We evaluate whether the inclusion of more diverse experts and practitioners in ERA improved the ecological knowledge base about South African biodiversity and the potential impacts of genetically modified (GM) crops. We conducted two participatory ERA workshops in South Africa, analyzing potential impacts of GM maize on biodiversity. The first workshop involved only four biological scientists, who were joined by 18 diverse scientists and practitioners in the second, and we compared the ERA process and results between the two using descriptive statistics and semi-structured interview responses. The addition of diverse experts and practitioners led to a more comprehensive understanding of biological composition of the agro-ecosystem and a more ecologically relevant set of hazards, but impeded hazard prioritization and the generation of precise risk assessment values. Results suggest that diverse participation can improve the scoping or problem formulation of the ERA, by generating an ecologically robust set of information on which to base the subsequent, more technical risk assessment. The participatory ERA process also increased the transparency of the ERA by exposing the logic and rationale for decisions made at each step."

The Latin American population is especially exposed to aflatoxins given that maize products can be found in traditional diets all over the continent. Interestingly, in Mexico, chronic hepatic diseases and cirrhosis are leading causes of death in adult population. In order to observe the effect of physical variables like temperature and humidity, this study was conducted collecting samples in four different seasons, in two communities in the State of San Luis Potosi, in Mexico.

Results showed that 18% of samples exceeded the Mexican limits for AFB1; whereas, 26% of the samples exceeded the limits of the European Union for AFB1. The AFB1 was detected in 80% of samples in one site and higher concentrations were found in samples collected during fall and winter seasons. Lack of control in storing practices is the principal cause for the contamination of maize. Considering that maize products are part of the staple diet of Mexican population, our results show that AFB1 detection has to be declared a public health priority.

The problem is of special significance in African countries because maize is a staple food. This manuscript describes a low-cost, portable, non-invasive device for detecting and sorting aflatoxin-contaminated maize kernels. We developed a prototype employing a modified, normalized difference fluorescence index (NDFI) detection method to identify potentially aflatoxin-contaminated maize kernels. Once identified, these contaminated kernels can be manually removed by the user. The device consists of a fluorescence excitation light source, a tablet for image acquisition, and detection/visualization software. Two experiments using maize kernels artificially infected with toxigenic Aspergillus flavus were implemented to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the device. The first experiment utilized highly contaminated kernels (71.18 ppb), while mildly contaminated kernels (1.22 ppb) were used for the second experiment. Evidently, the combined approach of detection and sorting was effective in reducing aflatoxin levels in maize kernels. With a maize rejection rate of 1.02% and 1.34% in the two experiments, aflatoxin reduction was achieved at 99.3% and 40.7%, respectively. This study demonstrated the potential of using this low-cost and non-invasive fluorescence detection technology, followed by manual sorting, to significantly reduce aflatoxin levels in maize samples. This technology would be beneficial to village farmers and consumers in developing countries by enabling safer foods that are free of potentially lethal levels of aflatoxins."

While SMB is widely accepted in many organic farming systems (OFS), little is known concerning the effectiveness, environmental impact, and influence on prokaryotic communities in soils receiving this treatment.

Pest larvae with variable levels of resistance developing on Bt diet are often stunted versus sensitive larvae developing on non-Bt diet.

Maize is usually harvested at 18% moisture, but it is not microbiologically stable until it reaches 14% moisture at the drying plants. We studied how three agronomic factors (crop diversification, tillage system and nitrogen fertilization rate) can affect fungal and mycotoxin contamination (deoxynivalenol and fumonisins B1 and B2) in maize at harvest. In addition, changes in maize during a simulated harvest-till-drying period were studied. DON content at harvest was higher for maize under intensive tillage than using direct drilling (2695 and 474 Œºg kg-1, respectively). We found two reasons for this: (i) soil crusting in intensive tillage plots caused the formation of pools of water that created high air humidity conditions, favouring the development of DON-producing moulds; (ii) the population of Lumbricus terrestris, an earthworm that would indirectly minimize fungal infection and mycotoxin production on maize kernels, is reduced in intensive tillage plots. Therefore, direct drilling is a better approach than intensive tillage for both preventing DON contamination and preserving soil quality. Concerning the simulated harvest-till-drying period, DON significantly increased between storage days 0 and 5. Water activity dropped on the 4th day, below the threshold for DON production (around 0.91). From our perspective, this study constitutes a step forward towards understanding the relationships between agronomic factors and mycotoxin contamination in maize, and towards improving food safety."

Therefore, a feeding trial with 30 dairy cows fed with three different levels of Fusarium (FUS) toxin-contaminated maize was performed. A control group (0.02 mg ZEN kg(-1) dry matter (DM) and 0.07 DON kg(-1) DM) was compared with two groups fed contaminated diets. The first diet contained 0.33 mg ZEN kg(-1) DM and 2.62 mg DON kg(-1) DM (group FUS-50) and the second diet contained 0.66 mg ZEN kg(-1) DM and 5.24 mg DON kg(-1) DM (group FUS-100). For milk sample analysis, a new cost-efficient sample preparation method was developed for the simultaneous determination of ZEN, DON and their metabolites. The method comprised the separation of the milk fat followed by an SPE clean-up on Oasis HLB and a LC-MS/MS measurement. The less toxic metabolite de-epoxy-DON had the highest detected concentration (5.6 ng ml(-1) milk) in the milk samples obtained from the feeding trial. Additionally, ZEN (up to 0.29 ng ml(-1)), Œ±-zearalenol (up to 0.17 ng ml(-1)), Œ≤-zearalenol (up to 0.95 ng ml(-1)) and DON (up to 2.5 ng ml(-1)) were detected in these samples. The milk toxin concentrations of cows fed the control diet were significantly lower compared with cows fed the contaminated diet. The calculated carryover rates ranged between 0 and 0.0075 for ZEN and metabolites and between 0 and 0.0017 for DON independent of exposure. It can be concluded that dietary toxin concentrations in the feed below or close to the current guidance values do not pose a risk for consumers due to negligible carryover rates."

Interviews and collection of maize flour samples was conducted from 1,500 people who processed maize at 143 mills in 10 administrative districts. Mycotoxins were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for aflatoxin and fumonisin, leading to detection at levels above the respective maximum tolerable limits in 39 and 37% of the samples, respectively. Samples with aflatoxin contamination above the legal limit ranged between 22 and 60% across the districts. A higher occurrence of aflatoxin was associated with smaller maize farms, lower grain yield, and monocropping systems, while a larger magnitude of the toxin was observed in the subhumid agroecological zone, in samples with more broken kernels, and, curiously, less maize ear damage at harvest. Analysis of paired grain samples (visually sorted and unsorted) showed that sorting reduced fumonisin by 65%, from above to below the legal limit of 1,000 ppb. Sorting did not, however, reduce aflatoxin levels. Although the aflatoxin problem is widely acknowledged, the high prevalence of fumonisin has not previously been reported.

According to fungal physiological particularities, mycotoxins can contaminate crops before harvest or during storage. Among toxins that represent a real public health issue, those produced by Fusarium genus in cereals before harvest are of great importance since they are the most frequent in European productions. Among them, deoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisins (FUM) frequently contaminate maize. In recent years, numerous studies have investigated whether food processing techniques can be exploited to reduce the levels of these two mycotoxins, which would allow the identification and quantification of parameters affecting mycotoxin stability. The particularity of the popcorn process is that it associates heat treatment with a particular physical phenomenon (i. e. , expansion). Three methods exist to implement the popcorn transformation process: hot air, hot oil, and microwaves, all of which are tested in this study. The results show that all popping modes significantly reduce FUM contents in both Mushroom and Butterfly types of popcorn. The mean initial contamination of 1351 ¬µg/kg was reduced by 91% on average after popping. For DON, the reduction was less important despite a lower initial contamination than for FUM (560 ¬µg/kg). Only the hot oil popping for the Mushroom type significantly reduced the contamination up to 78% compared to unpopped controls.

The cytogenetic tests consisted of observing mitotic index alterations after exposing lymphocyte cell cultures to different formulations. Encapsulation of the herbicides in the nanocapsules resulted in lower toxicity to the alga and higher toxicity to the microcrustacean, compared to the herbicides alone. The cytogenetic tests showed that formulations of nanocapsules containing the herbicides were less toxic than the herbicides alone. The findings indicate the potential of the nanocapsule formulations in agricultural applications, where they could help to reduce the quantities of herbicides used as well as impacts on the environment and human health."

We explored potential consequences of both insect resistant (IR) and herbicide resistant (HR) transgenic maize. IR maize can produce pollen that is toxic to lepidopteran larvae, and this puts butterfly species at possible risk if the presence of young larvae coincides with maize flowering, during which large quantities of maize pollen can be deposited on vegetation. By considering the timing of maize flowering in Europe and the phenology of the protected Lepidoptera species, we found that 31 species had at least one generation where 50% of the larval stage overlapped with maize flowering, and 69 species for which first instar larvae were present during maize pollen shedding. HR maize allows high concentration herbicide treatments on fields without seasonal limitation, which can drastically reduce weed densities. In cases where such weed species are host plants for protected butterflies, reduced host plant/food availability can result, causing population decreases. By using published information, we first identified the important weed species in major maize-growing European countries. Subsequently, we checked whether the host plants of protected Lepidoptera included species that are common maize weeds. We identified 140 protected species having food plants that are common weeds in one or more of the major European maize-growing countries. If HR maize is grown in Europe, there is a potential hazard that their food plants will seriously decline, causing a subsequent decline of these protected species."

A three seasons field experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of crop straw-derived biochar on the bioavailability and crop accumulation of Cd and Cu in contaminated soil. Wheat straw biochar (WSB), corn stalk biochar (CSB), and rice husk biochar (RHB) were applied at the rate of 0, 1.125, and 2.25¬†√ó¬†104¬†kg¬†ha-1, respectively. The results showed that all types of biochar significantly increased soil pH, organic carbon and cation exchangeable capacity (CEC), compared to the control. The reduction in DTPA extractable Cd and Cu contents was much greater under high dosage biochar application, with a prominence at RHB treatment throughout the three cropping seasons, compared to the control. Moreover, the biological accumulation of Cd and Cu in the grains of rapeseed and corn significantly decreased after biochar application. Linear regression also confirmed the effective role of biochar in controlling the translocation and accumulation of Cd and Cu due to their inactive bioavailability. In addition, the sequential extraction indicated that exchangeable fraction (EXF) of Cu and Cd had decreased, while residual fraction (RSF) had increased under all biochar amendments. Contrarily, the oxidizable fraction (OXF) of Cd decreased while OXF of Cu increased under biochar treatments. Biochar application, especially RHB, could be an effective measure to enhance Cd and Cu adsorption and immobilization in polluted soils and thereby reducing its uptake and translocation to crops."

One of the areas of concern is the possible impact on nontarget organisms. Crops expressing Cry toxins might affect Lepidoptera larvae living outside cultivated fields, through pollen deposition on wild plants, which constitute their food source. While pollen toxicity varies among different events, possible exposure of nontarget species depends on the agro-environmental conditions. This study was conducted in two protected areas in Italy, characterized by different climatic conditions, where many Lepidoptera species thrive in proximity to maize cultivations. To estimate the possible exposure in absence of the actual stressor (e. g. , Cry1-expressing maize plants), we conducted a two-year field survey of butterflies and weeds. Indicator species were selected-Aglais (Inachis) io in the Northern site and Vanessa cardui in the Southern site-and their phenology was investigated. Pollen dispersal from maize fields was measured by collection in Petri dishes. Duration and frequency of exposure was defined by the overlap between pollen emission and presence of larvae on host plants. Different risk scenarios are expected in the two regions: highest exposure is foreseen for A. io in the Northern site, while minimal exposure is estimated for V. cardui in the Southern site. In the latter case, locally grown maize cultivars flower in mid-summer in coincidence with an aestivation period for several butterfly species due to hot and dry conditions. Moreover, host plants of V. cardui are at the end of their life cycle thus limiting food availability."

Synergistic effects of multi-toxins are potentially more harmful than exposure to a single compound and can induce acute and chronic toxicity to animals and humans. The aim of the present study is to timely and simultaneously identify the multiple mycotoxigenic fungi capable of causing synergistic toxicity to improve the safety level of food and feedstuff. Here, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay was developed for simultaneous detection of mycotoxigenic fungi belonging to the genera Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium. Three pairs of genus-specific primers were designed based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of Aspergillus and Penicillium, and Elongation factor 1 alpha (EF- 1Œ±) of Fusarium. Amplicons of 170, 750 and 490 bp respectively for the corresponding primer pairs were detected; thus amplicon length is diagnostic for the individual fungal genus. The sensitivity of the developed method was tested with genomic DNA obtained from mould pure cultures and artificially contaminated maize grain powder. The sensitivity result showed that spore concentrations in the contaminated maize grain powder of 102 spores/mL were detected without prior incubation. This result suggests that the developed mPCR assay would allow a rapid, specific and simultaneous detection of various mycotoxigenic potential fungi based on the occurrence and size of the amplification products and thus to estimate the multi-mycotoxins contamination potential in food and feedstuff."

The EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) field-scale simulation model was used to assess long-term effects of improved crop rotations and crop residue management practices on wind erosion in Wuchuan County in Inner Mongolia. Simulation results indicate that preserving crop stalks until land is prepared by zone tillage for the next year's crop in lieu of using them as a source of heating fuel or livestock fodder significantly reduces wind erosion by 60%. At the same time, grain and potato (Solanum tuberosum L. ) yields were maintained or improved. Significant reductions in erosion, 35 to 46%, also resulted from delaying stalk removal until late January through late April. Yearly wind erosion was concentrated in April and May, the windiest months. Additionally, the use of alternative crop rotations resulted in differences in wind erosion, largely due to a difference in residue stature and quality and differences in biomass produced. As a result, altering current crop rotation systems by expanding corn (Zea mays L. ), wheat (Triticum aestivum L. ), and millet [Sorghum bicolor (L. ) Moench] and reducing potato and pea (Pisum sativum L. ) production significantly reduced simulated wind erosion, thus diminishing the severity of dust and sand storms in northwestern China. Saving and protecting topsoil over time will sustain land productivity and have long-term implications for improving conditions of rural poverty in the region."

Bone is an endocrine organ essential for whole-body homeostasis and is susceptible to toxicants. Herein, we tested the hypotheses that prenatal paternal exposure to POPs induces developmental bone disorders in fetuses across multiple generations and that FA supplementation attenuates these disorders. We used a four-generation rat model, in which F0 founder females were divided into four treatment groups. F0 females were gavaged with corn oil or an environmentally-relevant POPs mixture and fed either a control diet (2¬†mg FA/kg), or FA supplemented diet (6¬†mg FA/kg) before mating and until parturition (four treatments in total). After the birth of the F1 litters, all F0 females and subsequent generations received the FA control diet. Staining with alcian blue and alizarin red S of male and female fetal skeletons was performed at Gestational Day 19.5. Paternal direct and ancestral exposure to POPs delayed bone ossification and decreased the length of long limb bones in fetuses. Maternal FA supplementation did not counteract the POPs-associated delayed fetal ossification and reduced long bone length. In conclusion, prenatal paternal POPs exposure causes developmental bone abnormalities over multiple generations, which were not corrected by maternal FA supplementation."

This GIS-based approach uses wind speed, frequency of those winds, pesticide application rates, and spatial location of agricultural crops to identify areas with the highest potential for pesticide exposure. A test scenario based on an incident in Idaho (USA) was used to identify the relative magnitude of risk from off-target movement of herbicides to plants in the conterminous United States.

Agricultural areas, such as the Mississippi River Valley and the southeastern United States, appears to have less potential, possibly due to lower average wind speeds.

These practices were better implemented by Kinh households than Ede households reducing the post-harvest contamination of maize with F. verticillioides and fumonisin B1 (FB1), FB2, and FB3.

Moreover, the agrochemicals may accumulate in crops and, as a consequence, negatively influence the quality of food products and consumer health. Additional risks of plant protection products are related to their derivatives, that are created both in the environment (soil, water) and in plant organisms, since many of these compounds may exhibit toxic effects. This article is devoted to the degradation processes of pesticides used in potato crop protection. Attention is also paid to the toxicity of both parent compounds and their degradation products for living organisms, including humans. Information about the level of pesticide contamination in the environment (water, soil) and accumulation level in edible plants complement the current knowledge about the risks associated with widespread use of thiamethoxam, lambda-cyhalothrin and deltamethrin, rimsulfuron and metalaxyl in potato cultivation."

The environmental goals are supported by promotion of organic farming and the responsible management of inputs such as fertilisers and pesticides. In this framework, there is a need is to provide farmers with tools to evaluate the best options for reducing environmental impact and measure performances in improving the sustainability of their productions. This paper introduces MIMERA, a GIS easy-to-use tool for the sustainable use of pesticides at farm level. MIMERA was developed in the framework of the Train-Agro project funded by the Lombardia Region (Italy), in the framework of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development Programme (EAFRD). The main goal is to help professional pesticide users to identify the best pest management strategies by comparing the environmental risk of authorized commercial formulations of pesticides, identifying parcel most at risk within the farm boundaries and suggesting the most appropriate risk mitigation measures for the prevention of surface water contamination. Finally, MIMERA offers the opportunity to track the risk trend of the selected pest management strategies utilized during years. The proposed methodology and structure of MIMERA are described along with underlying data and algorithms are described. An example of its application by considering different pest management strategies adopted by farmers in an area characterized by the intensive presence of maize crop in Lombardia Region is presented."

Indeed, young children with their hand-to-mouth activity may be exposed to contaminated soils. The current study addresses the impact of soil organic matter (OM) condensation on bioavailability of sequestrated NDL-PCBs. Three artificial soils (ASs) were prepared according to OECD guideline 207. One standard soil (SS), devoid of OM, and two amended versions of this SS with fulvic acid (FA) or activated carbon (AC) were prepared to obtain 1% organic mass. This study involved fourteen juvenile male swine as a digestive physiology model of young children. Animals were randomly distributed into 4 contaminated groups (3 replicates) and a control one (2 replicates). During 10d, the piglets were fed AS or a corn oil spiked with 19200 ng of Aroclor 1254 per g of dry matter (6000 ng g(-1) of NDL-PCBs) to achieve an exposure dose of 1200 ng NDL-PCBskg(-1) of body weight per day. After 10d of oral exposure, NDL-PCBs in adipose tissue, liver and muscles were analyzed by GC-MS, after extraction and purification. Two distinct groups of treatments were found: on the one hand oil, SS and FA, on the other hand C and AC. This study highlights that condensed OM (AC) strongly reduces bioavailability whereas the less condensed one (FA) does not seem to have a significant effect. This result has to be considered as a first major step for further relative bioavailability studies involving mixture of different humic substances."

A simple analytical method to detect pathogens is essential for forecasting diseases and controlling mycotoxins. This article describes a proposed method for convenient and sensitive detection of Fusarium pathogens that uses the fusion of single-chain variable fragment (scFv) and alkaline phosphatase (AP). A highly reactive scFv antibody specific to soluble cell wall-bound proteins (SCWPs) of F. verticillioides was selected from an immunized chicken phagemid library by phage display. The antibody was verified to bind on the surface of ungerminated conidiospores and mycelia of F. verticillioides. The scFv-AP fusion was constructed, and soluble expression in bacteria was confirmed. Both the antibody properties and enzymatic activity were retained, and the antigen-binding capacity of the fusion was enhanced by the addition of a linker. Surface plasmon resonance measurements confirmed that the fusion displayed 4-fold higher affinity compared with the fusion's parental scFv antibody. Immunoblot analyses showed that the fusion had good binding capacity to the components from SCWPs of F. verticillioides, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed that the detection limit of the fungus was below 10(-2) Œºg mL(-1), superior to the scFv antibody. The fusion protein was able to detect fungal concentrations as low as 10(-3) mg g(-1) of maize grains in both naturally and artificially contaminated samples. Thus, the fusion can be applied in rapid and simple diagnosis of Fusarium contamination in field and stored grain or in food."

Therefore, the impact of TiO2 NPs (0, 100, 250‚ÄØmg/L) and Cd (0, 50‚ÄØŒºM) co-exposure on hydroponic maize (Zea mays L. ) was determined under two exposure modes. Results showed that root co-exposure to TiO2 NPs and 100‚ÄØmg/L Cd significantly enhanced Cd uptake and produced greater phytotoxicity in maize than foliar exposure to TiO2 NPs. Meanwhile, plant dry weight and chlorophyll content showed a reduction of 45.3% and 50.5%, respectively, when compared with single Cd treatment. In addition, the accumulation of Ti in shoots and roots increased by 1.61 and 4.29 times, respectively when root exposure to 250‚ÄØmg/L TiO2 NPs. By contrast, foliar exposure of TiO2 NPs could markedly decrease shoot Cd contents from 15.2% to 17.8% and had a stronger influence on alleviating Cd-induced toxicity via increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities and upregulating several metabolic pathways, including galactose metabolism and citrate cycle, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, as well as glycine, serine and threonine metabolism.

Our goal was to assess risk associated with transgenic corn debris entering streams. First, we show the input of corn tissue after harvest was extended over months in a stream. Second, using laboratory bioassays based on European corn borer [Ostrinia nubilalis (H√ºbner)], we found no bioactivity of Cry1Ab protein in senesced corn tissue after 2 wk of exposure to terrestrial or aquatic environments. Third, we show that Bt near-isolines modify growth and survivorship of some species of invertebrates. Of the four nontarget invertebrate species fed Bt near-isolines, growth of two closely related trichopterans was not negatively affected, whereas a tipulid crane fly exhibited reduced growth rates, and an isopod exhibited reduced growth and survivorship on the Cry1Ab near-isoline but not on the stacked Cry1Ab + Cry3Bb1 near-isoline. Because of lack of evidence of bioactivity of Bt after 2 wk and because of lack of nontarget effects on the stacked near-isoline, we suggest that tissue-mediated differences, and not the presence of the Cry1Ab protein, caused the different responses among the species. Overall, our results provide evidence that adverse effects to aquatic nontarget shredders involve complex interactions arising from plant genetics and environment that cannot be ascribed to the presence of Cry1Ab proteins."

Thus, three different biochars derived from rice straw, corn stalks, and bamboo were used to investigate the impacts of biochar amendments on As mobility/phytoavailability in As-contaminated soil using pot and microcosm experiments. The results showed a limited reduction (by 12-16%) in As accumulation in rice grains under a low-dose (0.5%, w/w) biochar amendment, although the three biochars displayed different physicochemical properties. In addition, the biochar amendments did not significantly decrease the As levels in the straw and roots, potentially because of the small changes in As mobility/phytoavailability in amended soil relative to the control. However, As levels in soil solution in the biochar treatment groups increased substantially, by 2.8-6.6 times, with increasing biochar doses (0.5-5%, w/w) in microcosm-based anaerobic incubation experiments, particularly at higher doses (3-5%, w/w). These results could be attributed to the biochar-enhancing activity of As(V)-/Fe(III)-reducing bacteria at a high biochar application rate.

The frequency and median concentration of five herbicides (2,4-D, atrazine, desethyl-atrazine, simazine, nicosulfuron), three fungicides (carbendazim, epoxiconazole, tebuconazole), and one insecticide (imidacloprid) were highest in biofilms sampled in summer crops during the growing period. Biofilms collected in the upper region of the catchment, where genetically modified soybean and corn cultivated in a no-tillage system prevail, the highest frequency and median concentration of three herbicides (2,4-D, thifensulfuron, isoproturon), four fungicides (carbendazim, epoxiconazole, tebuconazole, metconazole), and one insecticide (imidacloprid) were observed. Despite the excessive amounts of pesticides used in the catchment, the median values of all pesticides in the epilithic biofilm were considered low. The lower diversity and concentration of pesticides observed in the autumn/winter season is representative of lower use of pesticides, barriers to pesticide transfer from soil to water, and the biofilm's resilience capacity to decompose pesticides."

They could therefore be directly exposed to Cry proteins in Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)-transgenic crop fields by ingestion of pollen. They, or closely related species, are therefore often selected as surrogate test species in non-target risk assessment of Bt plants. In the current study, we evaluated the potential effects of the ingestion of Bt maize pollen containing the Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac fusion protein on various life-table parameters of the three pollen-feeding non-target species in laboratory feeding assays. The results showed that pupation rate and male adult fresh weight of P. japonica were significantly increased when fed pollen from Bt maize compared to control maize pollen, but other test life-table parameters were not affected. For the other two species, none of the tested life-table parameters (survival, pre-oviposition period, fecundity and adult fresh weight for C. nipponensis; survival and mean acinus diameter of hypopharyngeal glands for A. mellifera) differed between non-Bt and Bt maize pollen treatments. ELISA measurements confirmed the stability and uptake of the Cry protein by all three species during the feeding bioassays. In addition, a sensitive insect bioassay confirmed the bioactivity of the Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac protein in the Bt maize pollen used. Overall, the results suggested that the three pollen feeders are not sensitive to the Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac protein, and planting of the Bt maize variety will pose a negligible risk to P. japonica, adult C. nipponensis and adult A. mellifera."

The objective of this study was to determine whether there are differences in the species richness and composition of ants and ground beetles in Bt maize (four different toxins: Cry1Ab, Cry1F, and Cry1A.105/Cry2Ab2) and conventional isoline (non-Bt) fields, in the first (summer) and second (winter) cropping seasons in 13 localities of Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil, over a 2-yr period (2009-2011). The assessment of Coleoptera and Formicidae species was performed using pitfall traps placed in fields throughout the period of vegetative growth and maturation of plants. Data were analyzed using faunistic indices of species richness, ordination by nonmetric multidimensional scaling, and multivariate analysis of variance. No statistically significant difference was found in the species richness of ant and ground beetle communities when comparing sites of Bt with those of non-Bt maize. Overall, Bt technology did not affect the composition of ant and ground beetles; however, municipality and cropping season exerted influence on the beetle composition. Some species were only observed in the first crop, whereas others were only observed in the second crop. This research suggests that Bt maize does not affect ant and ground beetle populations differently from its isoline."

As and Hg are mainly dominated by the residual fraction. Total and bioavailability contributed significantly to As and Hg accumulation in corn, with root, stem3, and leaf accumulating more strongly. The results based on the bioavailability concentration soil-corn transfer factor indicated that As and Hg tended to accumulate more in the root, stem3, and leaf and less in grain, and further assessment of the human health effects of consuming contaminated cron is needed. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) results showed that As and Hg were not significantly toxic to corn parts, indicating morphology. As and Hg were bound to hydroxyl groups in the outer epidermal cell wall of the roots, thereby reducing upward translocation.

Thus far, the success of this strategy is untested. For the present experiment, we used two kinds of tortilla chips. One was made with a traditional corn flour recipe, while the other included cricket flour as an ingredient. People from the general population (N=104) were randomly assigned to consume either the traditional chips (control condition) or the cricket chips (experimental condition). After answering questions related to their eating behaviours, the participants tasted the chips. Both groups were informed prior to the tasting what kind of chips they would be sampling.

The human outbreak began during the same crop year as epizootics attributed to exposure to fumonisin, a mycotoxin that often contaminates corn. Because Mexican Americans in Texas consume large quantities of corn, primarily in the form of tortillas, they may be exposed to high levels of fumonisins. We examined whether or not maternal exposure to fumonisins increases the risk of NTDs in offspring using a population-based case-control study. We estimated fumonisin exposure from a postpartum sphinganine:sphingosine (sa:so) ratio, a biomarker for fumonisin exposure measured in maternal serum, and from maternal recall of periconceptional corn tortilla intake. After adjusting for confounders, moderate (301-400) compared with low (< or = 100) consumption of tortillas during the first trimester was associated with increased odds ratios (ORs) of having an NTD-affected pregnancy (OR = 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.3). No increased risks were observed at intakes higher than 400 tortillas (OR = 0.8 for 401-800, OR = 1.0 for > 800). Based on the postpartum sa:so ratio, increasing levels of fumonisin exposure were associated with increasing ORs for NTD occurrences, except for the highest exposure category (sa:so > 0.35). Our findings suggest that fumonisin exposure increases the risk of NTD, proportionate to dose, up to a threshold level, at which point fetal death may be more likely to occur. These results also call for population studies that can more directly measure individual fumonisin intakes and assess effects on the developing embryo."

To monitor the occurrence of mycotoxins in edible oils, it is important to develop analytical methods that can determine multiple mycotoxins in oil products. A stable isotope dilution LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous determination of 12 mycotoxins in five edible oil matrixes (canola, corn, olive, peanut, and soybean oil) was developed and validated. Methods: Prior to extraction, the oil samples were fortified with ¬π¬≥C uniformly labeled internal standards (¬π¬≥C-IS) for 12 target mycotoxins, followed by extraction and LC-MS/MS analysis. Quantitation was achieved using solvent-only calibration standards, relative response factors of ¬π¬≥C-IS, and target mycotoxins. Results: The majority of recoveries in oil for ochratoxin A and aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 fortified at 1, 10, and 100 ng/g as well as deoxynivalenol; fumonisins B1, B2, and B3; T-2 toxin; HT-2 toxin; and zearalenone fortified at 10, 100, and 1000 ng/g ranged from 80 to 120% with RSDs of <20%.

S. market samples, zearalenone was detected in three corn oil samples at 37, 185, and 317 ng/g, respectively. T-2 toxin was found in two corn oil samples at 7 and 10 ng/g, respectively. Conclusions: The method provides sufficient selectivity, sensitivity, accuracy, and repeatability to screen edible oils for regulated mycotoxins such as aflatoxins at low nanogram per gram concentrations without using conventional standard addition or matrix-matched calibration standards to correct for matrix effects."

Excessive accumulation of heavy metals in agricultural soils may not only result in environmental contamination, but lead to elevated heavy metal uptake by crops, which may affect food quality and safety. The work reported here studied heavy metal concentrations in crops irrigated with sewage sludge and sewage/sewage sludge admixtures at Firle Municipal Farm in Harare. The crops analysed in this study are heavily contaminated with the four regulated elements: Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn. This contamination is at its highest in two of the staple dietary crops maize and tsunga. Tsunga leaves contained 3.68 mg kg-1 Cd, over 18 times the permissible level by the EU standards (0.2 mg kg-1); Cu concentrations were 111 mg kg-1, 5 times the EU Standard (20 mg kg-1); concentrations of Pb were 6.77 mg kg-1, over 22 times the permissible levels allowed by both EU standards and UK guidelines (0.3 mg kg-1); Zn concentrations were 221 mg kg-1, over 4 times the guideline value (50 mg kg-1). The other plants (beans, maize, peppers and sugarcane) also contained concentrations of heavy metals above the permissible levels. Furthermore, the concentrations observed in this study were higher than those reported by other workers who have examined vegetation from other contaminated sites. This study highlights the potential risks involved in the cultivation and consumption of vegetables on plots irrigated with sewage sludge, a practice which may place at risk the health of the urban population who consume these vegetables."

To better understand the use of area under the curve (AUC) as a dose metric for complex biological responses following 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) exposure, a study was designed using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model in the female Sprague-Dawley rat that would result in equivalent AUCs of total liver TCDD with differing patterns of exposure. In the first group, rats received a high peak dose of 3500 ng TCDD/kg twice per week in the first week followed by a lower TCDD dose of 81 ng/kg twice per week for the remainder of the study. In the second group, rats received a gavage dose of 350 ng TCDD/kg in corn oil twice per week for the study duration of 15 weeks. Age-matched control rats received corn oil as a vehicle control. Placental glutathione S-transferase (PGST)-positive foci were measured in representative liver lobes by immunohistochemistry, as a representative complex biological response resulting from TCDD exposure. The median volume fraction was 0.045% in control rats and was significantly elevated in TCDD treatment groups. However, the volume fraction of PGST-positive foci was significantly higher in the TCDD group given the high peak dose during the first week of TCDD treatment compared with the group receiving the same average daily dose over the study duration: 0.74 versus 0.20%, respectively. These findings suggest that the peak magnitude of TCDD in liver rather than AUC may play a significant role in the induction of complex biological responses by TCDD."

However, lupine provokes allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. The presence of undeclared lupine residues in foods can pose a serious health risk to lupine-allergic individuals. Therefore, the objective of this research was to develop a sandwich-type ELISA for the detection of lupine residues in foods. Lupine flour derived from Lupinus albus was used to immunize 3 rabbits and a sheep. Pooled lupine-specific antibodies were partially purified from the sera by ammonium sulfate precipitation. A sandwich lupine ELISA with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1 ppm was developed by utilizing the rabbit antisera as the capture reagent and the sheep antiserum as the detector reagent. The binding of the antigen-antibody complex was visualized by the addition of commercial rabbit antisheep IgG antibody labeled with alkaline phosphatase with subsequent addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate to produce a colored product for quantification. Minor cross-reactivity was observed with soy (Glycine max) and black bean (Castanospermum australe). The performance of the lupine ELISA was evaluated in reference food standards (beef frankfurter and apple cinnamon muffin) and laboratory-prepared cooked frankfurters and corn muffins. The mean percent recovery for lupine spiked-frankfurters and corn muffins were 108.4%+/- 8.8% and 103.1%+/- 11.5%, respectively. The sandwich-type lupine ELISA developed in this study provides food manufacturers and regulatory agencies with an effective analytical tool to detect and quantify lupine residues in processed foods."

Our previous studies have demonstrated that benzenamine displayed strong inhibitory effects on the mycelial growth of A. flavus. In this study, we systematically investigated the inhibitory effects of benzenamine on the development, aflatoxin biosynthesis, and virulence in A. flavus, as well as the underlying mechanism. The results indicated that benzenamine exhibited great capacity to combat A. flavus at a concentration of 100 ¬µL/L, leading to significantly decreased aflatoxin accumulation and colonization capacity in maize. The transcriptional profile revealed that 3589 genes show altered mRNA levels in the A. flavus after treatment with benzenamine, including 1890 down-regulated and 1699 up-regulated genes. Most of the differentially expressed genes participated in the biosynthesis and metabolism of amino acid, purine metabolism, and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. Additionally, the results brought us to a suggestion that benzenamine affects the development, aflatoxin biosynthesis, and pathogenicity of A. flavus via down-regulating related genes by depressing the expression of the global regulatory factor leaA. Overall, this study indicates that benzenamine have tremendous potential to act as a fumigant against pathogenic A. flavus. Furthermore, this work offers valuable information regarding the underlying antifungal mechanism of benzenamine against A. flavus at the level of transcription, and these potential targets may be conducive in developing new strategies for preventing aflatoxin contamination."

Production of a mixture of ENs was performed by culturing F. tricinctum ITEM 9496 on white corn as substrate. The solid culture components were dried and subsequently extracted with water/methanol (50/50 v/v, 0.5% NaCl), homogenised, filtered, extracted by ethyl acetate and analysed by liquid chromatography with diode array detection (LC-DAD). The crude extract was first separated by low pressure liquid chromatography (LPLC) and then further purified by liquid chromatography (LC), resulting in six compounds with a purity higher than 95% as calculated by (1)H NMR, and with a yield of 30-300mg per compound. The chemical structures of the ENs were determined by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The biological activity of the resulting ENs was determined using a mitochondrial respiration test. We discovered that all the ENs studied induced an increase in the mitochondrial respiration resulting in uncoupling of the oxidative phosphorylation. This effect was most likely due to flux of K(+) ions into the mitochondrial matrix. The order of potency of the ENs derivatives was: A1>B1>B>A>B4>J1.

Our knowledge is still limited about the effectiveness of remediation process for Cd-contaminated agro-soils under atmospheric Cd deposition. In this study, eight soil amendments were used in a Cd-contaminated purple soil to investigate their impacts on soil Cd availability, microbial response, and Cd uptake by mustard and corn plants via simulating the atmospheric Cd deposition under laboratory incubation and greenhouse conditions. Results showed that the simulated atmospheric Cd deposition increased the soil high-risk Cd (HR, exchangeable and carbonate Cd) and decreased soil medium-risk Cd fraction (MR, bound to Fe/Mn oxide and organic Cd), and the largest direct effects on crop Cd uptakes were 0.94 and 0.66 for mustard and corn based on the path-coefficient analysis, respectively. Generally, Cd deposition led to decreasing soil microbial biomass carbon, populations of bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes, and enzyme activities of urease, catalase, sucrase, and acid phosphatase whereas increasing soil microbial biomass nitrogen. Compared with control and lime treatments, an organic-inorganic combined preparation (OCP) appeared to be effective for remediation of the Cd-contaminated purple soil due to its potential to increase the HR-Cd and reduce both MR-Cd and crop Cd uptake, as accompanied by its neutral effects on soil bacterial alpha diversity and community structure. Results also indicated that application of nitrogen fertilizers should be considered for remediation of the Cd-contaminated soils as nitrogen inputs were demonstrated to promote soil health under elevated Cd condition."

The authors compared an estimate of environmental risk for different crops and active ingredients using the IPEST index, which is based on a fuzzy-logic expert system. For IPEST calculations, four modules are defined, one reflecting the rate of application, the other three reflecting the risk for groundwater, surface water and air. The input variables are pesticide properties, site-specific conditions and characteristics of the pesticide application. The expert system calculates the value of modules according to the degree of membership of the input variables to the fuzzy subsets F (favourable) and U (unfavourable), and they can be aggregated following sets of decision rules. IPEST integrated values of >or= 7 reflect low environmental risk, and values of < 7 reflect high risk. Alfalfa, soybean and wheat showed IPEST values over 7 (low risk), while maize had the lowest IPEST values (high risk). Comparing active ingredients applied in annual and perennial crops, atrazine and acetochlor gave the highest risks of environmental contamination, and they are mainly used in maize. Groundwater was the most affected compartment. Fuzzy logic provided an easy tool combining different environmental components with pesticide properties to give a simple and accessible risk assessment. These findings provide information about active ingredients that should be replaced in order to protect water and air from pesticide contamination."

The aim of this research was to determine how soil pollution with diesel oil (brand name, Eco-Diesel) affects the chemical composition of maize (Zea mays L. ) and whether the application of ash from a combined heat and power plant, as well as from sewage sludge incineration, could reduce the potentially adverse impact of diesel oil on plants. The research results demonstrated that soil contamination with Eco-Diesel oil modified the content of selected macronutrients in the analyzed crop plant. Eco-Diesel oil had a negative effect on maize yield. The highest diesel oil dose in a series without neutralizing substances had a positive effect on the accumulation of most elements, except nitrogen and sodium. Soil enrichment with ash differentiated the content of macronutrients, mainly nitrogen and phosphorus, in the aerial biomass of maize. The ashes increased the yield of maize and content of some macronutrients, mainly nitrogen but also calcium, the latter in a series where soil was treated with ash from sewage sludge thermal recycling. Both types of ash also resulted in a decrease in the plant content of phosphorus, while ash from hard coal caused a slight reduction in the content of potassium in maize.

The addition of high-amylose corn starch further reduced the detection of FB1 (74.9%), when compared with the effect of the extrusion alone (66.0%), confirming the binding of FB1 with the macromolecules or resistant starch. The bound fumonisin was stable upon simulated gastric digestion, and the duodenal bioaccessibility of free FB1 was lower than 35% when high-amylose corn starch ingredient was used in the product. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that high-amylose corn starch and resistant starch content influenced the reduction of FB1 and its duodenal bioaccessibility. This study for the first time shows that addition of high-amylose corn starch during extrusion is an innovative strategy to reduce FB1 release under digestive conditions, therefore useful in mitigating the exposure to this mycotoxin."

This knowledge can enhance management strategies for the major challenges to combat aflatoxins. The search was conducted by applying a predefined search strategy, using bibliographic databases and websites, covering the period 2010 to 2018. Results showed that maize, peanuts, and animal feeds were the most studied commodities. For maize, all studies indicated mean AFB1 to exceed the European Union legal limit. From studies on contamination levels and biomarkers, it is clear that overall exposure is high, leading to a substantial increase in long-term disease burden. In addition, concentrations in food occasionally can reach very high levels, causing acute aflatoxicoses. The trade-related impact of aflatoxin contamination was mainly evaluated from the standpoint of aflatoxin regulation affecting products imported from Africa. There was a limited number of studies on health-related economic impacts, pointing out a gap in peer-reviewed literature.

It is therefore important to minimize exposures in these populations. Cleaning corn to remove damaged or moldy kernels reduces fumonisins in foods while milling increases their concentration in some and reduces their concentration in other products. Fumonisins are water-soluble and nixtamalization (cooking in alkaline water) lowers the fumonisin content of food products if the cooking liquid is discarded. Baking, frying, and extrusion cooking of corn at high temperatures ( > or = 190 degrees C) also reduces fumonisin concentrations in foods, with the amount of reduction achieved depending on cooking time, temperature, recipe, and other factors. However, the chemical fate of fumonisins in baked, fried, and extruded foods is not well understood and it is not known if the reduced concentrations result from thermal decomposition of fumonisins or from their binding to proteins, sugars or other compounds in food matrices. These possibilities might or might not be beneficial depending upon the bioavailability and inherent toxicity of decomposition products or the degree to which bound fumonisins are released in the gastrointestinal tract.

Among the novel traits that biotechnology has made available, an important group includes Bacillus thuringiensis-derived insect resistance. This technology has been applied to potatoes, cotton, and corn. Benefits of Bt crops, and biotechnology generally, can be realized only if risks are assessed and managed properly. The case of Starlink corn, a plant modified with a gene that encodes the Bt protein Cry9c, was a severe test of U. S. regulatory agencies. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency had restricted its use to animal feed due to concern about the potential for allergenicity. However, Starlink corn was later found throughout the human food supply, resulting in food recalls by the Food and Drug Administration and significant disruption of the food supply. Here we examine the regulatory history of Starlink, the assessment framework employed by the U. S. government, assumptions and information gaps, and the key elements of government efforts to manage the product. We explore the impacts on regulations, science, and society and conclude that only significant advances in our understanding of food allergies and improvements in monitoring and enforcement will avoid similar events in the future. Specifically, we need to develop a stronger fundamental basis for predicting allergic sensitization and reactions if novel proteins are to be introduced in this fashion. Mechanisms are needed to assure that worker and community aeroallergen risks are considered. Requirements are needed for the development of valid assays so that enforcement and post market surveillance activities can be conducted."

The hand-sorting and washing procedures, based on traditional maize-based food preparation practices, were previously customised under laboratory-controlled conditions. Home-grown maize and maize-based porridge collected at baseline were analysed for fumonisin B(1), B(2) and B(3). The geometric mean (95% confidence interval) of fumonisin contamination in the home-grown maize at baseline was 1.67 (1.21-2.32) mg kg(-1) and 1.24 (0.75-2.04) mg kg(-1) (dry weight) in the porridge. Fumonisin exposure was based on individual stiff porridge consumption and the specific fumonisin levels in the porridge (dry weight) consumed. Porridge (dry weight) consumption at baseline was 0.34 kg day(-1) and fumonisin exposure was 6.73 (3.90-11.6) ¬µg kg(-1) body weight day(-1). Female participants (n = 22) were trained to recognise and remove visibly infected/damaged kernels and to wash the remaining maize kernels. The discarded kernels represented 3.9% by weight and the fumonisins varied from 17.1 to 76.9 mg kg(-1). The customised hand-sorting and washing procedures reduced fumonisin contamination in the maize and porridge by 84 and 65%, respectively. The intervention reduced fumonisin exposure by 62% to 2.55 (1.94-3.35) ¬µg kg(-1) body weight day(-1). This simple intervention method has the potential to improve food safety and health in subsistence-farming communities consuming fumonisin-contaminated maize as their staple diet."

The presence of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in RWW can be critical, as these chemicals can be uptaken in irrigated crops and eventually ingested during food consumption. In the present study, an integrated model was developed to predict the fate of CECs in water reuse systems where RWW is used for edible crops irrigation. The model was applied to a case study where RWW (originating from a municipal wastewater treatment plant) is discharged into a water channel, with subsequent irrigation of silage maize, rice, wheat and ryegrass. Environmental and human health risks were assessed for 13 CECs, selected based on their chemical and hazard characteristics. Predicted CEC concentrations in the channel showed good agreement with available measurements, indicating potential ecotoxicity of some CECs (estrogens and biocides) due to their limited attenuation. Plant uptake predictions were in good agreement with existing literature data, indicating higher uptake in leaves and roots than fruits. Notably, high uncertainties were shown for weakly acidic CECs, possibly due to degradation in soil and pH variations inside plants. The human health risk due to the ingestion of wheat and rice was assessed using the threshold of toxicological concern and the hazard quotient. Both approaches predicted negligible risk for most CECs, while sulfamethoxazole and 17Œ±-ethinylestradiol exhibited the highest risk for consumers. Alternative scenarios were evaluated to identify possible risk minimization strategies (e. g. , adoption of a more efficient irrigation system)."

Hence, it is desirable to develop easy, sensitive and fast analytical screening methods for the determination of AgNPs in complex biological matrices. This study describes such a method using solid sampling high-resolution continuum source graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). A recently reported novel evaluation strategy uses the atomization delay of the respective GFAAS signal as significant indicator for AgNPs and thereby allows discrimination of AgNPs from ionic silver (Ag(+)) in the samples without elaborate sample pre-treatment. This approach was further developed and applied to a variety of biological samples. Its suitability was approved by investigation of eight different food samples (parsley, apple, pepper, cheese, onion, pasta, maize meal and wheat flour) spiked with ionic silver or AgNPs. Furthermore, the migration of AgNPs from silver-impregnated polypropylene food storage boxes to fresh pepper was observed and a mussel sample obtained from a laboratory exposure study with silver was investigated. The differences in the atomization delays (Œît(ad)) between silver ions and 20-nm AgNPs vary in a range from -2.01‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1.38 s for maize meal to +2.06‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1.08 s for mussel tissue. However, the differences were significant in all investigated matrices and so indicative of the presence/absence of AgNPs.

The objective of this study was the synthesis of Fe-pheophytin (FePhe) derivatives from natural chlorophyll and subsequent evaluation of their digestive behavior and bioaccessibility in vitro. FePhe a and a' were synthesized from crude spinach extracts by treatment with 1.3 M iron(II)chloride and 0.25 M Na-acetate dissolved in glacial acetic acid at 80 degrees C for 30 min. FePhe-rich extracts (approximately 1 mM) were formulated into corn starch based test meals (7.5% lipid) and subjected to a 2-step in vitro digestion designed to simulate in vivo gastric and small intestinal conditions. Recovery of FePhe following digestion and transfer of FePhe and pheophytins (Phe) from test meal matrix to mixed micelles was assessed by RP C18-HPLC to determine the digestive stability and micellarization efficiency (bioaccessibility). FePhe a and a' derivatives were moderately stable to digestive conditions with recoveries of 52.3% and 58.7%, respectively. Residual Phe a was stable to digestion. Micellarization efficiency of FePhe a (4%) and a' (3.4%) was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than Phe a (25.8%) from test meals. While digestive stability and micellarization efficiency are limiting, the presence of lipophilic FePhe derivatives in mixed micelles suggests that these compounds would be available for subsequent absorption in the intestinal tract."

Crop contamination with those highly toxic and carcinogenic compounds impacts both human and animal health, as well as the income of farmers and trade. In Nigeria, poultry productivity is hindered by high prevalence of aflatoxins in feeds. A practical solution to decrease crop aflatoxin content is to use aflatoxin biocontrol products based on non-toxin-producing strains of A. flavus. The biocontrol product Aflasafe¬Æ was registered in 2014 for use in maize and groundnut grown in Nigeria. Its use allows the production of aflatoxin-safe maize and groundnut. A portion of the maize treated with Aflasafe in Nigeria is being used to manufacture feeds used by the poultry industry, and productivity is improving. One of the conditions to register Aflasafe with the national regulator was to demonstrate both the safety of Aflasafe-treated maize to avian species and the impact of Aflasafe as a public good. Results presented here demonstrate that the use of maize colonized by an atoxigenic strain of Aflasafe resulted in superior (p < 0.05) broiler performance in all evaluated parameters in comparison to broilers fed with toxigenic maize. Use of an aflatoxin-sequestering agent (ASA) was not sufficient to counteract the harmful effects of aflatoxins. Both the safety and public good value of Aflasafe were demonstrated during our study. In Nigeria, the availability of aflatoxin-safe crops as a result of using Aflasafe allows poultry producers to improve their productivity, their income, and the health of consumers of poultry products."

Several laboratory and field trials have been conducted in Spain since the late 1990s to assess this issue. A consideration in the design of field trials is whether it is necessary to sample most NTAs living in the crop or only representative taxa that perform main ecological functions and have a good capacity to detect small changes in their abundance. Small changes in the field abundance of an effective representative taxon should be detectable using standard experimental protocols. The ability of a species to reveal differences across treatments may be analysed by examining the detectable treatment effects for surveyed non-target organisms. Analysis of data from several NTAs recorded in 14 field trials conducted over 10 years using complete block designs allowed us to select a number of representative taxa capable of detecting changes in the density or activity of arthropod herbivores, predators, parasitoids and decomposers in transgenic and non-transgenic maize varieties. The most suitable NTA as representative taxa (with detectable treatment effects below 50%) included leafhoppers among arthropod herbivores, Orius spp. , Araneae, and Carabidae among predators, chalcidids, particularly the family Mymaridae, among parasitoids and Chloropidae as decomposer. Details of sampling techniques for each sampled taxa and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed.

Both of the engineered strains could completely hydrolyze 5.0 mg/L ZEN in 8 h without detrimental effects on bacterial growth. The acid and bile tolerance assay and anchoring experiment on Caco-2 cells indicated both of the abovementioned engineered strains could survive during digestion and colonize on intestinal tract, in which the surface-displayed strain had a better performance on ZEN hydrolysis. Biodetoxification of model ZEN-contaminated maize kernels showed the surface-displayed L. reuteri strain could completely hydrolyze 2.5 mg/kg ZEN within 4 h under low water condition.

The results also revealed that most farmers apply preharvest crop management practices as a means of controlling contamination. More educated households were more knowledgeable about aflatoxins. Female-headed and married households were less likely to be willing to pay for aflatoxin control.

The pressure of O2 was then recorded by a handheld barometer. The aflatoxin concentration was inversely proportional to the pressure recorded via the barometer reading. After optimization, a limit of detection of 0.03 ng/mL and a linear range from 0.09 to 16.0 ng/mL were achieved. Recovery was recorded as 83.1%-112.0% along with satisfactory results regarding inner- and inter-assay precision (relative standard deviation, RSD < 6.4%). Little cross-reaction was observed. Additionally, the POCAD was validated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by using peanut and corn samples. The portable POCAD exhibits strong potential for applications in the on-site detection of small toxic molecules to ensure food safety."

The use of plant growth-promoting bacterial strains to mitigate heavy metal toxicity has been illustrated before. However, its potential to reduce plant arsenic uptake and toxicity has not been investigated to date. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a Nocardiopsis lucentensis strain isolated from heavy metal contaminated soil. Inoculation with this bioactive actinomycete strain decreased arsenic root and shoot bioaccumulation in both C3 and C4 crop species namely barley and maize. Upon arsenate treatment, N. lucentensis S5 stimulated root citric acid production and the plant's innate detoxification capacity in a species-specific manner. In addition, this specific strain promoted biomass gain, despite substantial tissue arsenic levels. Detoxification (metallothionein, phytochelatin, glutathione-S-transferase levels) was upregulated in arsenate-exposed shoot and roots, and this response was further enhanced upon S5 supplementation, particularly in barley and maize roots. Compared to barley, maize plants were more tolerant to arsenate-induced oxidative stress (less H2O2 and lipid peroxidation levels). However, barley plants invested more in antioxidative capacity induction (ascorbate-glutathione turnover) to mitigate arsenic oxidative stress, which was strongly enhanced by S5. We quantify and mechanistically discuss the physiological and biochemical basis of N. lucentensis-mediated plant biomass recovery on arsenate polluted soils. Our findings substantiate the potential applicability of a bactoremediation strategy to mitigate arsenic-induced yield loss in crops."

A series of experiments investigated the occurrence of AFB1 in soil and corn residues and ascertained the ecology of A. flavus in a Dundee silt loam soil. Samples of untilled soil (0-2 cm) and residues were collected in March 2007 from plots previously planted with a corn isoline containing the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) endotoxin gene or the parental non-Bt isoline. AFB1 levels were significantly different in various corn residues. The highest AFB1 levels were observed in cobs containing grain, with 145 and 275 ng. g-1 in Bt and non-Bt, respectively (P > or = F = 0.001). Aflatoxin levels averaged 3.3 and 9.6 ng. g-1 in leaves and (or) stalks and cobs without grain, respectively. All soils had AFB1 ranging from 0.6 to 5.5 ng. g-1 with similar levels in plots from Bt and non-Bt corn. Based on cultural methods, soil contained from log10 3.1 to 4.5 A. flavus cfu. g-1 with about 60% of isolates producing aflatoxin. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that AFB1 is rapidly degraded in soil at 28 degrees C (half-life < or = 5 days). The potential of the soil A. flavus to produce aflatoxins was confirmed by molecular methods. Transcription of 5 aflatoxin biosynthesis genes, including aflD, aflG, aflP, aflR, and aflS, were detected by reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction analysis in soil. Although AFB1 appears to be transient in soils, it is clear that AFB1 is produced in surface soil in the presence of corn residues, as indicated by A. flavus cfu levels, AFB1 detection, and expression of aflatoxin biosynthetic genes."

In recent years, the invasive fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) has adversely affected maize productivity and compromised food security. To mitigate pest-inflicted food shortages, China's Government issued biosafety certificates for two genetically modified (GM) Bt maize hybrids, Bt-Cry1Ab DBN9936 and Bt-Cry1Ab/Cry2Aj Ruifeng 125, in 2019. Here, we quantitatively assess the impact of both Bt maize hybrids on pest feeding damage, crop yield and food safety throughout China's maize belt. Without a need to resort to synthetic insecticides, Bt maize could mitigate lepidopteran pest pressure by 61.9-97.3%, avoid yield loss by 16.4-21.3% (range -11.9-99.2%) and lower mycotoxin contamination by 85.5-95.5% as compared to the prevailing non-Bt hybrids. Yield loss avoidance varied considerably between experimental sites and years, as mediated by on-site infestation pressure and pest identity. For either seed mixtures or block refuge arrangements, pest pressure was kept below established thresholds at 90% Bt maize coverage in Yunnan (where S. frugiperda was the dominant species) and 70% Bt maize coverage in other sites dominated by Helicoverpa armigera (H√ºbner) and Ostrinia furnacalis (Guen√©e). Drawing on experiences from other crop/pest systems, Bt maize in se can provide area-wide pest management and thus, contribute to a progressive phase-down of chemical pesticide use.

It is expected that in the future the number of DALYs and the associated cases of hepatocellular carcinoma due to aflatoxins exposure will increase due to climate change. The topics highlighted through this review, including the potential impact on health of the Portuguese population through the dietary exposure to aflatoxins, should represent an alert for the potential consequences of an incompletely explored perspective of climate change. Politics and decision-makers should be involved and committed to implement effective measures to deal with climate change issues and to reduce its possible consequences.

Inundative inoculation resulted in greater disease severity and fumonisin contamination than point inoculation. We also found that the two inoculation methods implicated different ear tissues in defense, with cob morphology being a more important component of resistance under point inoculation. Across both inoculation methods, traits related to cob size were positively associated with disease severity and fumonisin content. Our work demonstrates that (i) the use of diverse modes of inoculation is necessary for combining complementary mechanisms of genetic resistance, (ii) kernel bulk density can be used effectively as a proxy for fumonisin levels, and (iii) trade-offs may exist between yield potential and resistance to fumonisin contamination."

Comparison of vertical Hg soil profiles with As, Cu, Ni and Zn (which were not emitted by the plant) support Hg enrichment in surface horizons due to atmospheric Hg inputs from the chlor-alkali plant. Based on chemical extractions and elemental correlations, Hg was found to be weakly leachable and bio-available for plants, and most probably strongly bound to organic matter. In contrast, other trace elements were probably associated with phyllosilicates, iron oxides or with primary minerals. Hg stocks in the surface horizon of a forested soil (1255 mg Hg m(-3)) were two-fold higher than in an agricultural soil (636 mg Hg m(-3)) at a similar distance to the plant. The difference was attributed to the interception of atmospheric Hg by the canopy (most likely gaseous elemental Hg and reactive gaseous Hg) and subsequent litterfall incorporation. Some differences in the ability to trap atmospheric Hg were observed between tree species. The characterization of the litter showed an increasing Hg concentration in the plant material proportional to their degradation stage. In agricultural soils, very low Hg concentrations found in corn leaves and grains suggested a limited uptake via both the foliar and root pathways.

The results showed addition of ZnO NPs inhibited root colonization rate, increased the shoot/root P concentration ratio, and led to significant Zn accumulation in soil and plants. As predicted, AM effects on maize plants all varied with P supply levels, both with or without ZnO NP additions. Organic P interacted synergistically with AMF to promote plant growth and acquisition of P, N, K, Fe, and Cu. AM inoculation reduced the bioavailable Zn released from ZnO NPs and decreased the concentrations and translocation of Zn to maize shoots. In conclusion, ZnO NPs caused excess Zn in soil and plants, posing potential environmental risks. However, our present results first demonstrate that organic P exhibited similar positive effects to AMF and interacted synergistically with AMF to improve plant growth and nutrition, and to decrease Zn accumulation and partitioning in plants, and thus helped diminish the adverse effects induced by ZnO NPs."

The concern is that Bt-toxin longevity could be significantly reduced with recent adoption of a natural refuge for dual-gene Bt-cotton (CrylAc and Cry2Ab2 toxins) and concurrent reduction in dual-gene corn refuge from 50 to 20%. A population genetics framework that simulates complex landscapes was applied to risk assessment. Expert opinions on effectiveness of several transgenic corn and cotton varieties were captured and used to assign probabilities to different scenarios in the assessment. At least 350 replicate simulations with randomly drawn parameters were completed for each of four risk assessments. Resistance evolved within 30 yr in 22.5% of simulations with single-gene corn and cotton with no volunteer corn. When volunteer corn was added to this assessment, risk of resistance evolving within 30 yr declined to 13.8%. When dual-gene Bt-cotton planted with a natural refuge and single-gene corn planted with a 50% structured refuge was simulated, simultaneous resistance to both toxins never occurred within 30 yr, but in 38.5% of simulations, resistance evolved to toxin present in single-gene Bt-corn (CrylAb). When both corn and cotton were simulated as dual-gene products, cotton with a natural refuge and corn with a 20% refuge, 3% of simulations evolved resistance to both toxins simultaneously within 30 yr, while 10.4% of simulations evolved resistance to CrylAb/c toxin."

At short-time cultivation in corn cob (12 h), Bacillus firmus K-1 produced cellulase-free xylanolytic enzyme, with xylooligosaccharides (XOSs), X5 and X6, as the main products, which can be used in a variety of applications. The xylanolytic enzyme produced from B. firmus K-1 effectively degraded xylan in corn cob, which was examined by chemical composition, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). After cultivation, the xylan contained in the corn cob residue was decreased (as biological pretreatment), causing morphological and structural changes, including creating porosity and increasing the surface area and the exposure of cellulose of pretreated corn cob. These results lead to an improvement of cellulose access by cellulases. Commercially available cellulases, Accellerase¬Æ 1500 and Cellic¬Æ CTec2, yielded significantly higher glucose concentrations from pretreated corn cob compared to untreated corn cob. After saccharification, the lignin-rich corn cob residue can be used as a raw material for other purposes. Moreover, the B. firmus cells, with a low risk to human health, can be used in some applications. This study presents an efficient method for producing high-value-added products from agricultural residue (corn cob) through biological processes which are environmentally friendly and economically viable.

It causes considerable yield and economic losses, and poses a health risk to humans and livestock due to the high toxicity of aflatoxin. However, key genes and regulatory networks conferring maize resistance to A. flavus are not clear, especially at the early stage of infection. Here, we performed a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of two maize inbred lines with contrasting resistance to A. flavus infection. The pairwise comparisons between mock and infected kernels in each line during the first 6‚Äâh post inoculation (hpi) showed that maize resistance to A. flavus infection was specific to the genotype and infection stage, and defense pathways were strengthened in the resistant line. Further comparison of the two maize lines revealed that the infection-induced up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the resistant line might underlie the enhanced resistance. Gene co-expression network analysis by WGCNA (weighted gene co-expression network analysis) identified 7 modules that were significantly associated with different infection stages, and 110 hub genes of these modules. These key regulators mainly participate in the biosynthesis of fatty acid and antibiotics. In addition, 90 candidate genes for maize resistance to A. flavus infection and/or aflatoxin contamination obtained in previous studies were confirmed to be differentially expressed between the resistant and susceptible lines within the first 6 hpi. This work unveiled more A. flavus resistance genes and provided a detailed regulatory network of early-stage resistance to A. flavus in maize."

In a laboratory study, S. littoralis larvae were reared for their whole lifespan on a mixture of leaves and stems from 2-4-week old Bt maize plants. S. littoralis survival, developmental times and larval weights were significantly affected by Bt maize diet. However, adult moths, which survived development on Bt maize, were the same size as the adults from the control group. C. marginiventris survival, developmental times and cocoon weights were significantly negatively affected if their S. littoralis host larva had been fed Bt maize. ELISA tests confirmed that S. littoralis larvae ingest high amounts of CrylA(b) toxin while feeding on Bt maize. In S. littoralis pupae and in C. marginiventris cocoon silk, only traces of the toxin could be detected. No toxin was found in S. littoralis and C. marginiventris adults. Thus the toxin is not accumulating in the trophic levels and in fact appears to be excreted. Our results suggest that the effects on C. marginiventris when developing in susceptible S. littoralis larvae are indirect (host mediated).

Biomarkers have been developed and applied in many epidemiological studies assessing aflatoxin exposure and the associated health effects in these high-risk population groups. This review discusses the recent epidemiological evidence for aflatoxin exposure, co-exposure with other mycotoxins and associated health effects in order to provide evidence on risk assessment, and highlight areas where further research is necessary. Aflatoxin exposure can occur at any stage of life and is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma, especially when hepatitis B infection is present. Recent evidence suggests that aflatoxin may be an underlying determinant of stunted child growth, and may lower cell-mediated immunity, thereby increasing disease susceptibility. However, a causal relationship between aflatoxin exposure and these latter adverse health outcomes has not been established, and the biological mechanisms for these have not been elucidated, prompting further research. Furthermore, there is a dearth of information regarding the health effects of co-exposure to aflatoxin with other mycotoxins.

Optimal N treatment indirectly reduced the land use, life-cycle human toxicity, aquatic eco-toxicity, and terrestrial eco-toxicity potentials by improving grain yield and agronomic efficiency. In addition, the optimal N treatment reduced the energy consumption by enhancing the energy use efficiency (EUE) (+‚Äâ74%) and reducing non-renewable energy form (-‚Äâ45%) than the farmer's practice.

In warm climates, these fungi frequently contaminate crops such as maize, peanuts, tree nuts, and sunflower seeds. In many tropical and subtropical regions of the world, populations are coexposed to dietary aflatoxin and multiple infectious pathogens in food, water, and the environment. There is increasing evidence that aflatoxin compromises the immune system, which could increase infectious disease risk in vulnerable populations. Our aim was to conduct a dose-response assessment on a noncarcinogenic endpoint of aflatoxin: immunotoxicological effects. We sought to determine a noncarcinogenic tolerable daily intake (TDI) of aflatoxin, based on the existing data surrounding aflatoxin and biomarkers of immune suppression. To conduct the dose response assessment, mammalian studies were assessed for appropriateness of doses (relevant to potential human exposures) as well as goodness of data, and two appropriate mouse studies that examined decreases in leukocyte counts were selected to generate dose response curves. From these, we determined benchmark dose lower confidence limits (BMDL) as points of departure to estimate a range of TDIs for aflatoxin-related immune impairment: 0.017-0.082 Œºg/kg bw/day. As aflatoxin is a genotoxic carcinogen, and regulations concerning its presence in food have largely focused on its carcinogenic effects, international risk assessment bodies such as the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) have never established a TDI for aflatoxin. Our work highlights the importance of the noncarcinogenic effects of aflatoxin that may have broader public health impacts, to inform regulatory standard-setting."

Our data demonstrated that the environmentally available concentrations of As, Cd, Pb, and Zn in soils surrounding the Pb smelting plant are among the highest that have been reported. Apart from Cd, sequential extraction demonstrated that most metals are in recalcitrant forms in the soil. However, the daily exposure of children to Pb, Zn, Cd, and As exceeded the acceptable daily intake as established by the World Health Organization. Non-carcinogenic risk modeling indicated probable adverse health effects from chronic exposure to soil Pb. The mean estimated time for remediation of the area using phytoextraction was high, ranging from 76 to 259 years; therefore, this is not a viable alternative for remediating soils in the studied area.

Unsaturated soil is primarily oxic and can provide a stable environment for ferrihydrite nanominerals. To demonstrate the utility of ferrihydrite soil amendment, maize was grown in an unsaturated agricultural soil that is known to contain geogenic arsenic and uranium. The soil was maintained at a gravimetric moisture content of 15.1¬†¬±¬†2.5%, typical of periodically irrigated soils of the US Corn Belt. Synthetic 2-line ferrihydrite was used in low doses as a soil amendment at three levels (0.00% w/w (control), 0.05% w/w and 0.10% w/w). Further, the irrigation water was fortified (~50¬†Œºg¬†L-1 each) with elevated arsenic and uranium levels.

Numerous applications have been developed, and cover almost all cereals although most have been for key traits including moisture, protein, starch and oil in the globally important food grains, i. e. maize, wheat, rice and barley. An additional benefit in developing SK-NIR applications has been to demonstrate the value in sorting grain infected with a fungus or mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol, fumonisins and aflatoxins. However, there is still a need to develop cost-effective technologies for high-speed sorting which can be used for small grain samples such as those from breeding programmes or commercial sorting; capable of sorting tonnes per hour. Development of SK-NIR technologies also includes standardisation of SK reference methods to analyse single kernels. For protein content, the use of the Dumas method would require minimal standardisation; for starch or oil content, considerable development would be required. SK-NIR, including the use of hyperspectral imaging, will improve our understanding of grain quality and the inherent variation in the range of a trait.

This method demonstrated a considerable linear range of 0.30-25, 0.12-20, 0.30-20, 0.12-20, 0.60-30, 0.30-25, and 1.2-40Œºgkg(-1)and lower limits of detection at 0.1, 0.04, 0.1, 0.04, 0.2, 0.1 and 0.4Œºgkg(-1) for AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2, OTA, ZEN and T-2, respectively, in comparison with previously reported methods, as well as excellent recoveries. The mIAC capacity for AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2, OTA, ZEN, and T-2 were 187, 181, 153, 151, 105, 130, 88ng, respectively. It was found that all of the 7 mycotoxins were present in 90 agricultural product samples. The proposed method meets the requirements for rapid sample preparation and highly sensitive identification of multiple mycotoxins in agricultural product and food safety. This method provides a promising alternative with high throughput and high sensitivity for rapid analysis of seven mycotoxins in the monitoring of food safety."

In this study, autoclaved maize kernels were inoculated with A.¬†flavus and incubated at 25¬†¬∞C for up to 10¬†days. Aflatoxins and precursors were analyzed by a validated UHPLC-MS method. Additional to AFB1 and¬†AFB2, AFM1 and AFM2 were detected, confirming the ability of the formation of M-group aflatoxins on cereals by A.¬†flavus. The measured relative levels of AFB2, AFM1, and AFM2 on maize compared to the level of AFB1 (mean of days 5, 7, and 10 of incubation) were 3.3%, 1.5%, and 0.2%, respectively. The occurrence and kinetics of the measured aflatoxins and their precursors sterigmatocystin, O-methylsterigmatocystin, 11-hydroxy-O-methylsterigmatocystin, aspertoxin, and 11-hydroxyaspertoxin (group 1) as well as of dihydrosterigmatocystin and dihydro-O-methylsterigmatocystin (group 2) supported the so far postulated biosynthetic pathway. Remarkable high levels of O-methylsterigmatocystin and aspertoxin (17.4% and 4.9% compared to AFB1) were found, raising the question about the toxicological relevance of these intermediates.

Results of the study indicated that, concentrations of protein, fat, ash, Ca, Fe, Zn and Cu were significantly (p <or= 0.05) increased when plain corn and sorghum gruels were enriched with SUA-90 beans, peanut paste and/or ground sardines. Soaking and germinating the SUA-90 beans and dehulling the sorghum reduced the concentration of tannins in the gruels significantly (p <or= 0.05). The corn and sorghum-based composite gruels had short shelf lives when stored under ambient temperatures (28.6C) ranging between four and six hours, with gruels containing ground sardines showing a tendency to spoil faster. All composite products except those containing germinated SUA-90 beans were liked and highly accepted by consumers (p <or= 0.05) similar to the traditional plain corn and sorghum gruels.

Dietary exposure to aflatoxins is a public health concern due to their carcinogenic, acute and chronic effects. Rice is an important staple food consumed widely and consists of a major part of the diets for half of the world population. Human exposure to these mycotoxins is a serious problem especially in developing countries where hot and humid climates favor the fungal growth and where food storage conditions are poor and lack of regulatory limits enforcement. The recent developments of biomarkers have provided opportunities in assessing aflatoxins exposure and related health effects in the high-risk population groups. This review describes the worldwide occurrence of aflatoxins in rice during the period from 1990 to 2015 and biomarkers-based evidence for human exposure to aflatoxins and their adverse health effects. Aflatoxin is a potent hepatocarcinogen and humans may expose to it at any stage of life. Epidemiological studies reported an association between aflatoxin intake and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in some sub-Saharan and Asian countries. Even daily high intake of rice with a low level of contamination is of health concern. Thus, it is necessary to implement effective strategies to prevent contamination and fungal growth in rice. A good agricultural and manufacturing practice should be applied during handling, storage and distribution of rice to ensure that aflatoxins contamination level is lower in the final product. Moreover, a regular survey for aflatoxins occurrence in rice and biomarkers-based studies is recommended to prevent and reduce the adverse health effects in the world population."

The content of Cry1Ab toxin in different stages of F. tenuicornis reared on Bt maize and the persistence of the toxin in adults where determined in order to evaluate the possible exposure of predators when feeding on thrips. In addition, Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) was used as a model predator to assess how the behaviour of prey and predator may influence the exposure of a natural enemy to the Bt toxin. Life-table parameter results showed that F. tenuicornis was not affected when it was reared on Bt maize. This indicates that the potential for prey quality-mediated effects on predators is low. Bt content was highest in thrips larvae and adults, and negligible in the non-feeding prepupal and pupal stages. The persistence of the Cry1Ab toxin in adult F. tenuicornis was short, resulting in a decrease of 97% within the first 24 h. Predation success by young C. carnea larvae varied among the thrips stages, indicating that exposure of predators to Bt toxin can additionally depend on the prey stage.

Such conditions are optimal for the growth of fungi. The accumulative and transferrable characteristics of fungi mycotoxins pose a great potential threat as confirmed by high incidences of liver cancer in the Yangtze delta region.

Limited information is available on risk assessment of human health hazards of mycotoxins in rice, children should be paid more attention to due to their having the highest mycotoxins exposure level, although the risks are generally at low levels from rice. Mycotoxins are mainly distributed in the outer layer of the paddy rice (also called rough rice, referring to whole rice grain with the hulls), and the AFB1 content in bran is 8.4 times greater than that in brown rice (hulled rice).

The toxins frequently co-occur in maize. Where these commodities are dietary staples, for example, in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, the contamination translates to high-level chronic exposure. This is particularly true in subsistence farming communities where regulations to control exposure are either non-existent or practically unenforceable. Aflatoxins are hepatocarcinogenic in humans, particularly in conjunction with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, and cause aflatoxicosis in episodic poisoning outbreaks. In animals, these toxins also impair growth and are immunosuppressive; the latter effects are of increasing interest in human populations. FB have been reported to induce liver and kidney tumours in rodents and are classified as Group 2B 'possibly carcinogenic to humans', with ecological studies implying a possible link to increased oesophageal cancer. Recent studies also suggest that the FB may cause neural tube defects in some maize-consuming populations. There is a plausible mechanism for this effect via a disruption of ceramide synthase and sphingolipid biosynthesis. Notwithstanding the need for a better evidence-base on mycotoxins and human health, supported by better biomarkers of exposure and effect in epidemiological studies, the existing data are sufficient to prioritize exposure reduction in vulnerable populations. For both toxins, there are a number of practical primary and secondary prevention strategies which could be beneficial if the political will and financial investment can be applied to what remains a largely and rather shamefully ignored global health issue."

In this study, we investigated the effects of OPEs chemical structure, plant cultivar and copper (Cu) on the uptake and translocation of OPEs by plants. The bioaccumulation of OPEs varied among plant cultivars. They were preferentially enriched in carrot, with the lowest concentrations observed in maize. OPEs with electron-ring substituents (ER-OPEs) exhibited a higher potential for root uptake than did OPEs with open-chain substituents (OC-OPEs), which could be attributed to the higher sorption of ER-OPEs onto root charged surfaces. This was explained by the stronger noncovalent interactions with the electron-rich structure of ER-OPEs. The presence of Cu slightly reduced the distinct difference in the ability of roots to take up OC-OPEs and ER-OPEs. This was explained by the interactions of Cu ions with the electron-rich structure of ER-OPEs, which suppressed the sorption of ER-OPEs on the root surface. A negative relationship between the logarithms of the translocation factor and octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) was observed in treatments with either OPEs only or OPEs¬†+¬†Cu, implying the significant role of hydrophobicity in the OPEs acropetal translocation. The results will improve our understanding of the uptake and translocation of OPEs by plant cultivars as well as how the process is affected by the chemical structure of OPEs and Cu, leading to improvements in the ecological risk assessment of OPEs in the food chain."

To minimize aflatoxin contamination in several crops, a biocontrol technology based on atoxigenic strains of Aspergillus flavus is commercially used in the United States and some African countries. Significant efforts are underway to popularize the use of biocontrol in Africa by various means including incentives. The purpose of this study was to develop quantitative pyrosequencing assays for rapid, simultaneous quantification of proportions of four A. flavus biocontrol genotypes within complex populations of A. flavus associated with maize crops in Nigeria to facilitate payment of farmer incentives for Aflasafe (a biocontrol product) use. Protocols were developed to confirm use of Aflasafe by small scale farmers in Nigeria. Nested PCR amplifications followed by sequence by synthesis pyrosequencing assays were required to quantify frequencies of the active ingredients and, in so doing, confirm successful use of biocontrol by participating farmers. The entire verification process could be completed in 3-4 days proving a savings over other monitoring methods in both time and costs and providing data in a time frame that could work with the commercial agriculture scheme. Quantitative pyrosequencing assays represent a reliable tool for rapid detection, quantification, and monitoring of multiple A. flavus genotypes within complex fungal communities, satisfying the requirements of the regulatory community and crop end-users that wish to determine which purchased crops were treated with the biocontrol product. Techniques developed in the current study can be modified for monitoring other crop-associated fungi."

This study was undertaken to assess the hypothesis that grain sorting can be used to reduce mycotoxin contamination in grain lots by removing toxic kernels. We tested a set of sorting principles and methods for reducing mycotoxin levels in maize and groundnut from a variety of genotypes and environments. We found that kernel bulk density (KBD) and 100-kernel weight (HKW) were associated with the levels of aflatoxins (AF) and fumonisins (FUM) in maize grain. A low-cost sorter prototype (the 'DropSort' device) that separated maize grain based on KBD and HKW was more effective in reducing FUM than AF. We then evaluated the effectiveness of DropSorting when combined with either size or visual sorting. Size sorting followed by DropSorting was the fastest method for reducing FUM to under 2¬†ppm, but was not effective in reducing AF levels in maize grain to under 20¬†ppb, especially for heavily AF-contaminated grain. Analysis of individual kernels showed that high -AF maize kernels had lower weight, volume, density, length, and width and higher sphericity than those with low AF. Single kernel weight was the most significant predictor of AF concentration. The DropSort excluded kernels with lower single kernel weight, volume, width, depth, and sphericity. We also found that visual sorting and bright greenish-yellow fluorescence sorting of maize single kernels were successful in separating kernels based on AF levels. For groundnut, the DropSort grouped grain based on HKW and did not significantly reduce AF concentrations, whereas size sorting and visual sorting were much more effective."

However, the development and commercialization of Bt vegetables has lagged in comparison, which is unfortunate since vegetables tend to be insecticide-intensive crops due to high pest pressure and cosmetic standards required for the market. While it is often stated that consumer choice has played a major role in companies avoiding development of Bt vegetables, this concept requires re-evaluation. In market studies in North America when consumers have been provided basic information about Bt genetic engineering, then given a choice between Bt and conventional sweet corn, they have often preferred the former. Likewise, 77% of consumers in a US survey said they would likely purchase foods produced through biotechnology for their ability to reduce pesticide use. Presently, however, the only commercialized Bt vegetable is sweet corn. Perhaps more critical obstacles to Bt vegetables are their relatively smaller acreages and the cost of government biosafety regulations that inadvertently favor large acreage of field crops because companies can obtain a better return on investment. In developing countries, private-public partnerships may provide the vehicle to bring Bt vegetables to market. However, these can be subverted by misinformation from anti-biotech campaigns, as is the case with Bt eggplant in India.

Three hybrids of the twenty entries had lower infection severity compared with the general means for toxigenic species. Three were highly susceptible to each, and 14 hybrids reacted differently to the different fungi. Differences were also observed in the toxin content.

For fumonisin and F. verticillioides ear rot, the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was 0.45 (p = 0.05). Two independent isolates with different aggressiveness were used, and their mean X values better described the resistance levels. This increased the reliability of the data. With the introduction of this methodological concept (testing the resistance levels separately for different fungi and with two isolates independently), highly significant resistance differences were found.

In the indirect bioassay, parasitism rate, cocoon weight and the number of M. cingulum progeny produced per host were significantly reduced when M. cingulum-parasitized Cry1Ac-susceptible Ostrinia furnacalis were fed a diet containing purified Cry1Ac; however, life-table parameters of M. cingulum were not adversely affected when the same assay was performed with Cry1Ac-resistant O. furnacalis. These results indicated that the detrimental effects detected with a Cry1Ac-susceptible host were mediated by poor host quality. In a direct bioassay, no difference in life-table parameters were detected when M. cingulum adults were directly fed a 20% honey solution with or without Cry1Ac; however, survival and longevity were significantly reduced when M. cingulum adults were fed a honey solution containing potassium arsenate, which was used as a positive control. The stability and bioactivity of Cry1Ac toxin in the food sources and Cry1Ac toxin uptake by the host insect and parasitoid were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and sensitive-insect bioassays.

DBP exposure significantly reduced the expression of DDR genes including those involved in homologous recombination (Atm, Brca1, Mre11a, Rad50), mismatch repair (Msh3, Msh6), and nucleotide excision repair (Xpc, Pcna) in a dose-specific manner. Interestingly, staining for the DNA damage marker, Œ≥H2AX, was similar between treatments.

Three sub-systems, namely feed production, dairy farm and dairy factory, were taken into account to determine how and where Iranian pasteurized milk production might be made more environmentally friendly and energy efficient.

The four selected PAHs achieved equilibrium between the air and the two living crop leaf surfaces over the 15-day monitoring period. Inter-species and inter-chemical variability existed in terms of the time required to achieve equilibrium, mass transfer coefficients (kAL) and the equilibrated adsorption capacity (EAC), which was mainly attributed to the different lg KOA values among the four PAHs and the variable leaf-wax content between the soybean and corn species. Compared with when the PAHs existed singly, the time required to achieve adsorption equilibrium was longer while the EAC was reduced for each of the four PAHs in a mixture, which was attributed to competitive adsorption among the coexisting components. These findings prove that the novel analytical method provides a novel platform for the in situ characterization of the environmental behaviors of multiple PAHs, with their spectra overlapping, between the air and plant skin. The coexistence of multiple PAHs in the air inhibits their individual uptake capacity by crop leaf skin, but increases the total adsorption of PAHs, potentially reducing crop security and increasing human health risk via the terrestrial food web."

Each site consisted of a 1.2-ha test plot adjacent to a 0.2-ha control plot. Suction lysimeters and monitoring wells were installed at multiple depths within each test and control plot to sample soil-pore water and near-surface ground water. Irrigation was applied to each site during the growing season to ensure water input of 110 to 200% of average historical rainfall. Acetochlor dissipated rapidly from surface soils at all sites with a DT(50) (time for 50% of the initial residues to dissipate) of only 3 to 9 d, but leaching was not an important loss mechanism, with only 0.25% of the 15,312 soil-pore water and ground water samples analyzed containing parent acetochlor at or above 0.05 microg L(-1). However, quantifiable residues of a soil degradation product, acetochlor ethanesulfonic acid, were more common, with approximately 16% of water samples containing concentrations at or above 1.0 microg L(-1). A second soil degradation product, acetochlor oxanilic acid, was present at concentrations at or above 1.0 microg L(-1) in only 0.15% of water samples analyzed.

Often, these populations rely on one or two staple foods for the bulk of their calories, making them more susceptible to chronic intake of certain toxins. Exposure to common foodborne toxins is associated with diverse conditions such as cancer, immunotoxicity, growth impairment, and neurological deficits. Interventions focused solely on reducing toxin levels have proven difficult to sustain. Using case studies of two foodborne toxins, aflatoxin and cassava cyanide, this article addresses the heightened risk of particular diseases from eating monotonous diets based in maize, groundnuts, and cassava: common in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. We also discuss the potential role of increased dietary diversity in counteracting these diseases. Increased dietary diversity can reduce consumption of toxins and increase intake of nutrients that could counteract the toxicity of such chemicals. In Qidong, China, a population that previously consumed a monotonous maize-based diet and increased dietary diversity since the 1980s has experienced a dramatic reduction in liver cancer mortalities. That liver cancer decreased as dietary diversity increased is the catalyst for the hypothesis that dietary diversity could have a direct impact on reducing health effects of foodborne toxins. Future research, agricultural development, and food policy reforms should take into consideration the multifaceted benefits associated with improved dietary diversity. Collaborations between toxicologists, nutritionists, and policymakers are important to development of sustainable interventions to reduce foodborne toxin exposure and promote health through increased dietary diversity."

In doing so, many have discovered that the direct impacts of their owned operations are dwarfed by those upstream in the supply chain, requiring transparency and knowledge about environmental impacts along the supply chains. Life cycle assessments (LCAs) have been used to identify hotspots of environmental impacts at national levels, yet these provide little subnational information necessary for guiding firms' specific supply networks. In this paper, our Food System Supply-Chain Sustainability (FoodS3) model connects spatial, firm-specific demand of corn purchasers with upstream corn production in the United States through a cost minimization transport model. This provides a means to link county-level corn production in the United States to firm-specific demand locations associated with downstream processing facilities. Our model substantially improves current LCA assessment efforts that are confined to broad national or state level impacts. In drilling down to subnational levels of environmental impacts that occur over heterogeneous areas and aggregating these landscape impacts by specific supply networks, targeted opportunities for improvements to the sustainability performance of supply chains are identified."

Managing organic N sources to provide sufficient N for crop growth requires knowledge of C and N decomposition over several years, particularly where manure and compost are applied. We report a comparison of compost and chemical fertilizer, use of a corn-corn-soybean-wheat rotation compared to continuous corn and the use of cover crops. Nitrogen (150 d) and C incubations (317 d) were conducted to determine the effect of cropping system and nutrient management on: N mineralization potential (NMP), the mineralizable organic N pool (N(o)), the mean residence time (MRT) of No, C mineralization (C(min)), and soil organic carbon (SOC) pool sizes and fluxes. Compost applications over 6 y increased the resistant pool of C by 30% and the slow pool of C by 10%. The compost treatment contained 14% greater soil organic C than the fertilizer management. Nitrogen was limiting on all compost treatments with the exception of first year corn following wheat fallow and clover cover crop. The clover cover crop and wheat-fallow increased inorganic N in both nutrient managements.

Providing these details in problem formulation helps focus the ecological risk assessment on the relevant species of concern. Postharvest plant residue is often considered to be the most significant route of exposure for genetically modified crops to adjacent aquatic environments.

The potential allergenicity of the introduced proteins can be evaluated by focusing on the source of the gene, the sequence homology of the newly introduced protein to known allergens, the expression level of the novel protein in the modified crop, the functional classification of the novel protein, the reactivity of the novel protein with IgE from the serum of individuals with known allergies to the source of the transferred genetic material, and various physicochemical properties of the newly introduced protein, such as heat stability and digestive stability. Few products of agricultural biotechnology (and none of the current products) will involve the transfer of genes from known allergenic sources. Applying such criteria provides reasonable assurance that the newly introduced protein has limited capability to become an allergen."

To do this, we assembled longitudinal cotton damage data that spanned the Bt adoption period, collected cotton damage data since Bt resistance has been detected, and estimated local population susceptibility using replicated on-farm studies that included all Bt pyramids marketed in cotton. Significant year effects of H.¬†zea damage frequency in commercial cotton were observed throughout the Bt adoption period, with a recent damage increase after 2012. Landscape-level Bt crop production intensity over time was positively associated with the risk of H.¬†zea damage in two- and three-toxin pyramided Bt cotton. Helicoverpa zea damage also varied across Bt toxin types in spatially replicated on-farm studies. Landscape-level predictors of H.¬†zea damage in Bt cotton can be used to identify heightened Bt resistance risk areas and serves as a model to understand factors that drive pest resistance evolution to Bt toxins in the southeastern United States.

The inclusion criteria to select dairy farm participants were (1) to have at least two cows and (2) use of commercially prepared dairy feeds.

This study was quoted, among others, to justify the ban of Bt maize (MON 810) in Germany. The study has subsequently been criticized because of methodological shortcomings that make it questionable whether the observed effects were due to direct toxicity of the two Cry proteins. We therefore conducted tritrophic studies assessing whether an effect of the two proteins on A. bipunctata could be detected under more realistic routes of exposure. Spider mites that had fed on Bt maize (events MON810 and MON88017) were used as carriers to expose young A. bipunctata larvae to high doses of biologically active Cry1Ab and Cry3Bb1. Ingestion of the two Cry proteins by A. bipunctata did not affect larval mortality, weight, or development time. These results were confirmed in a subsequent experiment in which A. bipunctata were directly fed with a sucrose solution containing dissolved purified proteins at concentrations approximately 10 times higher than measured in Bt maize-fed spider mites. Hence, our study does not provide any evidence that larvae of A. bipunctata are sensitive to Cry1Ab and Cry3Bb1 or that Bt maize expressing these proteins would adversely affect this predator. The results suggest that the apparent harmful effects of Cry1Ab and Cry3Bb1 reported by Schmidt et al. , Arch Environ Contam Toxicol 56:221-228 (2009) were artifacts of poor study design and procedures.

Since no insect pests are attacking the teff grains, farmers do not apply pesticides on it, unlike maize and other grains. Nevertheless, residues of organochlorine pesticides have been detected at an alarming level that could pose a consumer risk. Teff is often consumed as injera which is a fermented flat pancake. The main aim of the present study is, therefore, to investigate the effect of household food processing (doughing and baking) on the reduction of pesticide residues from teff. Pesticide residues previously detected in teff grain such as permethrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos ethyl, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDT, and p,p'-DDT were spiked and extracted followed by the subsequent household processing which are generally doughing (dough making followed by fermentation) and baking. From the findings of this study, doughing decrease the pesticide residues in the range of 59.9-86.4% and baking in the range of 63.2-90.2%. Kruskal-Wallis analysis indicates that the reduction of pesticide residues by baking is significantly different from doughing (p-value < 0.0001). There is also a significant difference between non-fermented and fermented dough (p-value = 0.012). The processing factor for doughing and baking was less than one (PF < 1 = reduction factor) which indicates the reduction of pesticides due to teff processing.

In the field studies, the biochar application of 50¬†t/ha in maize and oilseed rape crops significantly increased the mean number of mesofauna. This change probably resulted from improved soil chemical properties (in particular organic carbon content and cation exchange capacity) upon biochar addition. The results of the avoidance test with the use of springtail species Folsomia candida showed the possible short-term toxicity risk from a dose of 5%. The results of the reproduction test indicate the negative response of F. candida from the rate of 25% (higher than the field dose, which corresponds to 10% in laboratory tests). The reason for the short-term toxicity might be the considerable increase in soil pH after biochar addition.

To assess parent and alkylated PAHs accumulation accurately, the uptake of individual 7-isopropyl-1-methylphenanthrene (Retene), 3-methyl-phenanthrene (3-MP) and phenanthrene (Phe) by living maize, soybean and potato leaf surfaces, as well as the effects of cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTMAB) and anionic sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS), were examined in situ using fiber-optic fluorimetry. For each of three PAH chemicals, the uptake achieved equilibrium between the air and living crop leaf surfaces within the 120-h monitoring period. There is inter-chemical and inter-species variability in terms of both the time required reaching equilibrium, the equilibrated adsorption concentration (EAC) and the overall air-surfaces mass transfer coefficient (kAS). The EAC of the three PAHs for each of the three crops' leaf surfaces increased with the number of alkyl substitutions on the aromatic ring. For any given PAHs, the EAC values followed the sequence of potato > soybean > maize, which was dominantly controlled by their leaf surface polarity index ((O+N)/C). The presence of CTMAB and SDBS increased the EAC of PAHs in the three crops' leaf surfaces by 6.5-17.1%, due to the plasticizing effect induced by the surface-sorbed surfactants, and the enhancement degree was closely associated with leaf-wax content and lg KOW values of PAHs. In addition, the two surfactants promoted the kAS values of the three chemicals by 7.7-23.3%. These results demonstrated that surfactants promoted the uptake of PAHs onto the crop leaf surfaces, potentially threatening the agricultural product safety."

Because of their wide distribution, the potential health hazard, and economic significance, they are considered one of the most important mycotoxin classes. Epidemiological evidence suggests a relationship between the Fusarium load in corn, exposure to fumonisins, and esophageal cancer. However, mechanisms of actions of fumonisins are not yet fully resolved and epidemiological studies suffer from various confounding factors. Correspondingly, the most relevant congener of the fumonisin family (fumonisin B1 ) has been classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans and maximum limits have been set for corn and corn-based products. However, many non-corn-based products are also susceptible to fumonisin contamination. Indeed, some of them contain very high amounts of fumonisins, but enter the market legally. Furthermore, fumonisin exposure of consumers is probably consistently being underestimated because only a fraction of fumonisins can be detected by routine analysis. The bioavailability and toxicity of most nondetectable (cryptic) forms has not been resolved. In this work, we review the developments of cancer research into fumonisins since their discovery in 1988 until today and provide an overview of the contributions of various foodstuffs to fumonisin exposure, including those products that have been largely neglected in the past. In conclusion, (1) corn remains the principal source of fumonisin ingestion, but fumonisins in non-corn-based commodities require continuous monitoring; (2) cryptic fumonisins should be included in risk assessment studies; and (3) certain population groups (for example children) may suffer from enhanced exposure and could face increased health risks."

Contamination of crops at levels of 20¬†ng¬†g(-1) or higher (as regulated by the USFDA) by this toxin and potent carcinogen makes the crop unsalable, resulting in a significant economic burden on the producer. This review focuses on elimination of this contamination in corn which is a major US crop and the basis of many products. Corn is also ""nature's example"" of a crop containing heritable resistance to aflatoxin contamination, thereby serving as a model for achieving resistance to aflatoxin contamination in other crops as well. This crop is the largest production grain crop worldwide, providing food for billions of people and livestock and critical feedstock for production of biofuels. In 2011, the economic value of the US corn crop was US$76 billion, with US growers producing an estimated 12 billion bushels, more than one-third of the world's supply. Thus, the economics and significance of corn as a food crop and the threat to food safety due to aflatoxin contamination of this major food crop have prompted the many research efforts in many parts of the world to identify resistance in corn to aflatoxin contamination. Plant breeding and varietal selection has been used as a tool to develop varieties resistance to disease. This methodology has been employed in defining a few corn lines that show resistance to A. flavus invasion; however, no commercial lines have been marketed. With the new tools of proteomics and genomics, identification of resistance mechanisms, and rapid resistance marker selection methodologies, there is an increasing possibility of finding significant resistance in corn, and in understanding the mechanism of this resistance."

According to the findings aflatoxin regularly occurs at preharvest in Hungary and possibly other countries in the region can be jeopardized. We tested, with an improved methodology (two isolates, three pathogens, and a toxin control), 18 commercial hybrids (2017-2020) for kernel resistance (%), and for toxin contamination separately by two-two isolates of F. graminearum, F. verticillioides (mg/kg), and A. flavus (Œºg/kg). The preharvest toxin contamination was measured in the controls. Highly significant kernel resistance and toxin content differences were identified between hybrids to the different fungi. Extreme high toxin production was found for each toxic species. Only about 10-15% of the hybrids showed higher resistance to the fungal species tested and lower contamination level of their toxins. The lacking correlations between resistance to different fungi and toxins suggest that resistance to different fungi and response to toxin contamination inherits independently, so a toxin analysis is necessary. For safety risk estimation, separated artificial and natural kernel infection and toxin data are needed against all pathogens. Higher resistance to A. flavus and F. verticillioides stabilizes or improves feed safety in hot and dry summers, balancing the harmful effect of climate changes. Resistance and toxin tests during variety registration is an utmost necessity.

Mitigating these toxins in food and feed is a critical and ongoing worldwide effort. We have previously investigated biosynthetic gene clusters in Aspergillus flavus that are linked to fungal virulence in corn. We found that one such cluster, asa, is responsible for the production of aspergillic acid, an iron-binding, hydroxamic acid-containing pyrazinone metabolite. Furthermore, we found that the asa gene cluster is present in many other aflatoxin- and ochratoxin-producing aspergilli. The core gene in the asa cluster encodes the small nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like (NRPS-like) protein AsaC. We have swapped the asaC ortholog from A. sclerotiorum into A. flavus, replacing its native copy, and have also cloned both asaC orthologs into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that AsaC orthologs in section Flavi and section Circumdati, while only containing adenylation-thiolation-reductase (ATR) domains, can selectively biosynthesize distinct pyrazinone natural products: deoxyaspergillic acid and flavacol, respectively.

Understanding the dynamic of heavy metals in soil-plant systems is essential for environmental risk assessment and sustainable agriculture. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to explore the effects of treated wastewater irrigation on plant growth, soil chemical properties, and the movements of Zn, Cu, Pb, and Cd from soil to plants in monoculture and intercropping systems. Maize and soybean were selected as the test crops and groundwater and treated livestock wastewater as the water sources.

The concentrations of Zn, Pb, and Cd were significantly higher in leaves compared to other plant parts contrastingly to Cu, which was higher in roots. In addition, treated wastewater irrigation increased grain nutrient content in mono- and intercropping systems while the concentration of heavy metals was in the acceptable range for human consumption. The enrichment degree of Cu and Pb due to treated livestock wastewater irrigation relative to groundwater irrigation was higher in uncultivated soil compared with cultivated soil.

Plants containing pesticides residues may then reach the soil during the crop cycle or after harvest. However, the fate in soil of pesticides residues in plants is unknown. Two commonly used foliar herbicides, glyphosate and sulcotrione, (14)C-labeled, were applied on leaves of oilseed rape and/or maize, translocation was studied, and then soil incubations of aerial parts of plants containing herbicides residues were performed. Soil treated directly with herbicides was used as control. The effects of adjuvants on herbicide plant-absorption and subsequent soil-degradation were also investigated comparing herbicides application as active ingredients and as commercial formulations. The fate in soil of herbicides residues in plants was different from that of control, and different for glyphosate and sulcotrione. Mineralization in soil of glyphosate in crops decreased compared to control, and amounts of (14)C-extractable residues, mainly composed by the metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), and non-extractable residues (NER) increased. In contrast, mineralization in soil of sulcotrione in maize increased compared to control, with a decrease in the (14)C-extractable residues and an increase in NER. The fate of both herbicides was influenced by the type of plant organ in which herbicide was incorporated, because of differences in herbicides bioavailability and organs biodegradability, but not by adjuvants. Absorption of both herbicides in plant delays their subsequent soil-degradation, and particularly, glyphosate persistence in soil could increase from two to six times. The modifications of herbicide degradation in soil due to interception by plants should be considered for environmental risks assessment."

Therefore, it is of interest to reduce the contamination of crops by aflatoxins in the field and post-harvest. Among the current technologies being developed is the deployment of non-aflatoxigenic strains of Aspergillus species to competitively exclude aflatoxigenic conspecifics from crops in the field thereby curtailing aflatoxin production by the former. The success in this endeavor makes the non-aflatoxigenic fungi good candidates for biological control programs. However, the current techniques for segregating non-aflatoxigenic from aflatoxigenic fungi suffer two main drawbacks: they are based on morphological and chemical tests with a combination of visual color changes detected in a culture plate which suffer some degree of inaccuracy. Secondly, the existing methods are incapable of accurately quantifying aflatoxin production by fungi in culture. We developed a culture system for inducing aflatoxin production by Aspergillus using maize kernels as growth substrate followed by quantification using ELISA. The method was compared to the Dichlorvos-Ammonia (DV-AM) method for determining aflatoxigenicity. Our findings encapsulate a method more robust than the currently used DV-AM approach because, for the first time, we are able to assess aflatoxigenicity and aflatoxigenic variability among Aspergillus species earlier classified as non-aflatoxigenic by the DV-AM method. Furthermore, the new method presents an opportunity to attribute toxin production by actively growing fungal cultures. We believe this method when further developed presents a chance to study and predict fungal behavior prior to field trials for biological control programs."

The goal of the present paper was to uncover how various heavy metals and non-metallic elements affect human health and bacterial diversity in cornfields and to explore the contribution of soil bacteria to heavy metal accumulation in crops. Soil samples were collected from five counties in Shandong Province, China, where abnormally high levels of heavy metals and metalloids were caused by mining and heavy industry. We calculated a hazard quotient (HQ) to evaluate the health risk these heavy metals cause and analyzed the soil bacterial community using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The HQ results showed that As posed the greatest threat to human health followed by Pb although concentrations of all metals did not reach the health risk threshold. Meanwhile, principal component analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed soil bacterial richness was significantly influenced by As, Ni, and Cr as well as pH and phosphorus, but not by the species diversity of aboveground weeds. The most abundant bacteria in our study region were heavy metal tolerant groups, specifically Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Moreover, correlation analysis suggested that Actinobacteria might reduce the phytoaccumulation of Cr, Cu, Zn, and Hg in corn, while Proteobacteria might weaken phytoaccumulation of Pb, Ni, As, and Cd. Our results verified that heavy metals play an important role in shaping the soil bacterial community.

Phytoremediation of cadmium pollution is an environmentally friendly and inexpensive remediation method. In this study, maize (Zea mays L. ) was selected as the phytoremediation crop by a potted method, and the bioavailability of cadmium was investigated by adding exogenous elemental sulfur. The relationships among the sulfur content, maize growth, cadmium accumulation, and soil parameters were systematically studied. The results showed that, with the supplement of sulfur, the soil pH and activities of soil enzymes (urease, catalase, and sucrase) decreased gradually, and the available heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Zn, and Cu) in soil showed an upward trend. The optimal cadmium enrichment was achieved under T2 by increasing both the biomass of the maize plant and the cadmium concentration in roots and stems. However, T3 and T4 significantly inhibited the growth of maize roots and shoots, leading to a much lower plant biomass compared with that of CK (sulfur-free treatment) and T2. In addition, the cumulative cadmium was not increased because of the low accumulation of cadmium in some parts of the plant. Correlation analyses showed that the sulfur content was negatively correlated with soil pH and maize biomass (P < 0.01), and the cadmium content of whole maize was positively correlated with the dry weight of maize (P < 0.05) and the cadmium content in roots and stems (P < 0.01). In summary, to optimize cadmium phytoremediation of the plastic shed soil, an appropriate concentration of sulfur should be selected in practical applications to ensure that the biomass of the maize is maximized, and the cadmium concentration in different parts of the maize is increased or stabilized."

From the studied species, common bean was the most sensitive and maize was the least sensitive to As. Those species were the ones that accumulated the lowest As levels in shoot tissues.

In the non-rhizosphere, either CB300 or BB700 suppressed PAH dissipation and decreased the bioavailability via adsorption processes. Compared to the control, the total concentration of PAHs in the rhizosphere was higher in the 2% BB700 treatment but the bioavailable concentration was lower. This indicates that BB700 decreased the bioavailability of PAHs primarily via immobilization (adsorption processes). By contrast, the total and bioavailable PAH concentrations were both lower in the 2% CB300 treatment than those in the control. The abundance of bacteria such as Arthrobacter and Flavobacterium and the total number of genes playing important roles in microbial PAH degradation processes increased significantly (p<0.05), which were likely responsible for the rapid dissipation of PAHs in the 2% CB300 treatment in the rhizosphere. These results indicate that CB300 decreased the PAH bioavailability primarily via increasing degradation of PAHs by indigenous microorganisms. The two biochars both showed better effectiveness at reducing the bioavailability of high-molecular-weight PAHs than the low-molecular-weight PAHs in the rhizosphere. Therefore, the mechanisms on how biochar reduces the PAH uptake into carrot are dependent on the type of biochar (e. g. , pyrolysis temperature and feedstock) and root presence."

Cadmium low-accumulating maize and rice were screened using cluster and Pareto analytic methods. In addition, a new method, the species-sensitive distribution model (SSD), was proposed, which could be used to estimate the environmental threshold for cadmium in regional cropland.

The feed intake rate (FIR) was estimated experimentally as 4.895¬†g/day per bird, representing 12.43% of bw.

Based on spill data values available in the literature, it was calculated that, for most crops, a baywing would have to forage an area of field corresponding to less than 60 m2 to obtain the number of seeds required to reach the LD50. It was also shown that this number of seeds is coherent with the amount of seeds ingested in a bout. In a pilot study, all grayish baywings fed with millet seeds treated with 3¬†g IMI/kg died within three to five days of exposure. In Tier I risk assessment, the trigger value was achieved for all crops except soybean and a weight-of-evidence risk assessment was performed. All lines of evidence examined are consistent with the view that grayish baywings, and probably other small farmland birds, are exposed to a risk of acute toxicity and mortality under both worst-case and mixed-ration exposure scenarios.

It is present in the genomes of all fumonisin producing Fusarium spp. Reliable detection of fum1 can provide an estimate of the toxicological potential of cultures and food sources. Therefore, a fum1 specific LAMP assay was developed and tested with purified DNA of 48 different species from the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex (FFSC). The fum1 gene was detected in 22 species among which F. fujikuroi, F. globosum, F. nygamai, F. proliferatum, F. subglutinans and F. verticillioides were the most prominent fumonisin producers. None out of 92 tested non-Fusarium species showed cross reactions with the new assay. The lowest limit of detection (LOD) was 5¬†pg of genomic DNA per reaction for F. fujikuroi, F. nygamai and F. verticillioides. Higher LODs were found for other LAMP positive species. Apart from pure genomic DNA, the LAMP assay detected fumonisin-producers when 103 conidia/reaction were used as template after mechanical lysis. LAMP-results were well correlated with FB1 production.

The paper performs health-based cost-effectiveness analyses of two potential aflatoxin control strategies in Africa: (1) pre-harvest biocontrol, using atoxigenic strains of Aspergillus flavus competitively to exclude toxigenic strains from colonizing maize in Nigeria; and (2) post-harvest interventions in a package to reduce aflatoxin accumulation in groundnuts in Guinea. It is described how health benefits gained from each intervention, in terms of fewer aflatoxin-induced hepatocellular carcinoma cases, can be compared with the costs of implementing the interventions. It is found that both interventions would be extremely cost-effective if applied widely in African agriculture. That is, the monetized value of lives saved and quality of life gained by reducing aflatoxin-induced hepatocellular carcinoma far exceeds the cost of either biocontrol or the post-harvest intervention package to achieve those health benefits. The estimated cost-effectiveness ratio (CER; gross domestic product multiplied by disability-adjusted life years saved per unit cost) for biocontrol in Nigerian maize ranged from 5.10 to 24.8; while the estimated CER for the post-harvest intervention package in Guinean groundnuts ranged from 0.21 to 2.08. Any intervention with a CER > 1 is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be 'very cost-effective', while an intervention with a CER > 0.33 is considered 'cost-effective'.

S. littoralis raised on conventional maize or ""high quality"" Calliphora sp. pupae were fed to the beetle larvae in two control treatments. Bt-maize-fed caterpillar prey increased mortality to 100% within 40 days. The experiment was repeated with 10-day-old beetle larvae. Bt treatment resulted in fewer pupae than in both controls, and in a higher mortality than in the Calliphora control. S. littoralis was suitable as exclusive prey in no-choice tests, at least for 40 days, although prey quality seemed to be low compared to Calliphora pupae. The observed effects are most likely indirect effects due to further reduced nutritional prey quality. However, direct effects cannot be excluded. In the second part of the study, exposure of P. cupreus to Bt intoxicated prey was examined in paired-choice tests. Adult beetles were offered a choice between different prey conditions (frozen and thawed, freshly killed or living), prey types (S. littoralis caterpillars, Calliphora sp. pupae, cereal aphids) and prey treatments (raised on Bt or conventional maize). Living prey was preferred to frozen and dead prey. Caterpillars were only preferred to fly pupae and aphids when living. Prey treatment seemed to be least important for prey selection. The tests showed that P. cupreus ingested caterpillars readily and there was no evidence of them avoiding Bt containing prey, which means exposure in the field could occur.

An analogous hypothesis set was tested here: farmers who believe they have had adverse health experiences from pesticides are likely to have heightened concerns about pesticides and are more likely to take greater precautions in dealing with pesticides. This work is based on an original survey of a population of 2700 corn and soybean growers in Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania using the U. S. Department of Agriculture data base. It was designed as a mail survey with telephone follow-up, and resulted in a 60 percent response rate. Farm operators report experiencing adverse health problems they believe are associated with pesticides that is equivalent to an incidence rate that is higher than the reported incidence of occupational pesticide poisonings, but similar to the reported incidence of all pesticide poisonings. Farmers who report experiencing such problems have more heightened concerns about water pollution from fertilizers and pesticides, and illness and injury from mixing, loading, and applying pesticides than farmers who have not experienced such problems. Farmers who report experiencing such problems also are more likely to report using alternative pest management practices than farmers who do not report having such problems.

Despite the fact that small amounts of Cry proteins were detected in some samples of the non-feeding pupal stage of H.¬†axyridis as well as in eggs, we conclude that this route of exposure is unlikely to be significant for predators or parasitoids in a Bt maize field."

Three initial liquid concentrations for each considered compound were examined (i. e. , 0.3¬†Œºg¬†L-1, 3¬†Œºg¬†L-1, 30¬†Œºg¬†L-1). The results indicated that the 30¬†Œºg¬†L-1 treatments were phytotoxic, as they resulted in a significant decrease in shoot dry weight. Plant-driven removal of the tested FRs decreased with the increasing initial spiking level and were reportedly higher for the NBFRs (range 42%-10%) than OPFRs (range 19%-7%). All the considered FRs were measured in the roots (range 0.020-6.123¬†Œºg¬†g-1 dry weight -DW-) and shoots (range 0.012-1.364¬†Œºg¬†g-1 DW) of the tested plants, confirming that there was uptake. Linear relationships were identified between the chemical concentrations in the plant parts and the tested hydroponic concentrations. Root concentration factors were positively correlated with the specific lipophilicity (i. e. , logKow) of the tested FRs and were determined to be higher for the NBFRs than the OPFRs. The NBFRs had a higher root uptake rate than the OPFRs, and this trend was more significant with the increasing treatment concentrations. Shoot/root concentration factors were found to be lower than the unity value for 10 of the 11 tested compounds. These results can be related to the specific molecular configurations and the occurrence of different functional groups in the tested compounds. The results will help to improve risk assessment procedures and fine tune our understanding of human receptor responses to the ingestion of maize crops grown on agricultural sites irrigated with water contaminated by FRs."

GM maize, its near-isogenic hybrid (with or without insecticide treatment), and two other reference hybrids were each grown in five 0.5 ha plots. The opportunity for exposure to Cry toxin from plant residues ploughed into the soil was shown by the presence of saprophagous dipteran larvae that are common prey of predatory staphylinid species and hosts of the parasitoid species. 2587 individuals belonging to 77 staphylinid species were sampled using pitfall traps. Lesteva longoelytrata (31%), Oxypoda acuminata (12%), Aloconota sulcifrons (8%) and Anotylus rugosus (7%) were the most abundant beetles in the field. Bionomics, food specialization, temperature requirements and size group were assigned for 25 most common species. These traits determine the occurrence of staphylinid beetles in the field, the food sources they could utilize and thus also their likely contact with the Cry3Bb1 toxin. Statistical analysis of activity abundance, Rao indices and multivariate analysis of distribution of particular categories of functional traits in the field showed negligible effects of the experimental treatments, including the GM maize, upon the staphylinid community. Staphylinid beetles represent a considerably diverse part of epigeic field fauna with wide food specialization; these features render them suitable for the assessment of environmental safety of GM insect protected maize. However, the availability of prey and the presence of particular staphylinid species and their abundance are highly variable; this complicates the interpretation of the results."

Given that different crops have varying Cd bioaccumulation factors, crops with low Cd bioaccumulation abilities can be selected for the safe usage of Cd -contaminated lands. This study aimed to investigate Cd contamination in soil and crops and the influencing factors of soil Cd activity in a tin mining area (TMA) and control area (CA) and to put forward suggestions for the safe usage of farmlands by developing prediction models of Cd content in different crop grains. We collected 72 and 40 pairs of rice and maize grain samples, respectively, along with their rhizosphere soil samples and 6176 topsoil samples. The results showed that compared with the CA, the Cd pollution was more severe in the cultivated soil and crop grains around TMA. Furthermore, rice has a strong ability to transport Cd from soil to grains, whereas maize has a poor Cd uptake ability. The total organic carbon, CaO, pH, and Mn in soil play key roles in the transfer of Cd from soil to crop grains. Using these parameters and Cd concentration in soil, two sets of accurate Cd prediction models were developed for maize and rice. Based on the Cd concentration in the topsoil and predicted Cd concentration in crop grains, the safe utilization scheme of farmland was proposed. The proportions of priority protection, safe exploitation, planting adjustment, and strict control were 72.59%, 22.77%, 3.16%, and 1.48% in the TMA, respectively. The values reached 80.51% (priority protection), 19.12% (safe exploitation), 0.37% (planting adjustment), and 0% (strict control) in the CA. Thus, given the difference between Cd accumulation in rice and maize, adjustment of planting crops in contaminated farmlands can be applied to maximize the use of farmland resources."

MycoKey, an EU-funded Horizon 2020 project, was established to advance knowledge and technology transfer around the globe to address mycotoxin impacts in key food and feed chains. MycoKey included several working groups comprising international experts in different fields of mycotoxicology. The MycoKey Maize Working Group recently convened to gather information and strategize for the development and implementation of solutions to the maize mycotoxin problem in light of current and emerging technologies. This feature summarizes the Maize WG discussion and recommendations for addressing mycotoxin problems in maize. Discussions focused on aflatoxins, deoxynivalenol, fumonisins, and zearalenone, which are the most widespread and persistently important mycotoxins in maize. Although regional differences were recognized, there was consensus about many of the priorities for research and effective management strategies. For preharvest management, genetic resistance and selecting adapted maize genotypes, along with insect management, were among the most fruitful strategies identified across the mycotoxin groups. For postharvest management, the most important practices included timely harvest, rapid grain drying, grain cleaning, and carefully managed storage conditions. Remediation practices such as optical sorting, density separation, milling, and chemical detoxification were also suggested. Future research and communication priorities included advanced breeding technologies, development of risk assessment tools, and the development and dissemination of regionally relevant management guidelines."

This study informs that endeavor by a risk assessment and economic analysis of two important mycotoxins: fumonisins and aflatoxins. The goals are to identify the nations that would be most heavily impacted by tighter mycotoxin regulations, examine costs and benefits as a function of regulatory stringency, and address risk-risk tradeoffs between health benefits and economic losses from compliance with those regulations. Among industrial nations, the United States would experience the heaviest economic losses from more precautionary mycotoxin standards. Environmental conditions in the developing world, however, are more conducive to mycotoxin accumulation in crops. Contrary to concerns expressed among policymakers, the less developed countries that would likely experience the greatest loss from tighter mycotoxin standards are not sub-Saharan African nations, but China and Argentina. If a fumonisin standard of 0.5 mg/kg were adopted worldwide, total export losses from fumonisins in corn may exceed 300 million dollars annually: 3-fold higher than if the less stringent U. S. standard of 2 mg/kg were adopted. Likewise, export losses from aflatoxins in peanuts may exceed 450 million dollars under the current EU regulatory standard of 4 microg/kg: almost 5-fold higher than if the U. S. standard of 20 microg/kg were adopted. Stricter standards are unlikely to improve health significantly. In developing nations such as China where hepatitis B and C are prevalent, tighter aflatoxin standards may increase health risks until improved control methods for aflatoxins are found, as high-quality crops may be exported instead of being consumed domestically."

We evaluated the reliability of multiplex PCR assays based on TRI3 and TRI12 genes, and single PCR assays based on TRI7 and TRI13 genes to infer trichothecene chemotypes of 112 strains of Fg complex collected from northwest Argentina, checking trichothecene production by chemical analysis. Single and multiplex PCR assays indicated that strains belonging to F. meridionale (87/112) had a NIV genotype. The remainder strains (25/112), which belonged to F. boothii, had a DON genotype (based on single PCR assays) or 15ADON genotype (based on multiplex PCR assays). No strains tested were incorrectly diagnosed with a DON/NIV genotype. Chemical analysis indicated that the F. meridionale strains were NIV producers only (44/87), major NIV producers with unexpected high DON/NIV ratios (36/87), or unexpected major DON producers with minor NIV production (7/87). Strains with atypical DON/NIV production seem to be new phenotypes under a putative NIV genotype, since PCR assays do not provide evidences of a new trichothecene genotype. DON production and absence of its acetylated forms were shown for strains of F. boothii. The inconsistencies between genetic and chemical data highlight the risk of inferring the trichothecenes potentially contaminating food and feedstuffs based only on PCR assays. This study confirms for the first time that strains of Fg complex from maize of northwest Argentina are DON and NIV producers. In addition, dominance of NIV producers in the Fg complex population isolated from maize is unprecedented in Argentina, and of significant concern to food safety and animal production."

Laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of Cry3Bb1 or Cry1Ab-expressing transgenic maize (MON 88017, Event Bt176) pollen on fitness parameters of adult C. carnea. Adults were fed pollen from Bt maize varieties or their corresponding near isolines together with sucrose solution for 28 days. Survival, pre-oviposition period, fecundity, fertility and dry weight were not different between Bt or non-Bt maize pollen treatments. In order to ensure that adults of C. carnea are not sensitive to the tested toxins independent from the plant background and to add certainty to the hazard assessment, adult C. carnea were fed with artificial diet containing purified Cry3Bb1 or Cry1Ab at about a 10 times higher concentration than in maize pollen. Artificial diet containing Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) was included as a positive control. No differences were found in any life-table parameter between Cry protein containing diet treatments and control diet. However, the pre-oviposition period, daily and total fecundity and dry weight of C. carnea were significantly negatively affected by GNA-feeding. In both feeding assays, the stability and bioactivity of Cry proteins in the food sources as well as the uptake by C. carnea was confirmed. These results show that adults of C. carnea are not affected by Bt maize pollen and are not sensitive to Cry1Ab and Cry3Bb1 at concentrations exceeding the levels in pollen. Consequently, Bt maize pollen consumption will pose a negligible risk to adult C. carnea."

For situ measuring the bioavailability of heavy metals, the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) is superior to other traditional methods. It is also important to find a method for predicting heavy metal enrichment in maize based on the DGT method. In this study, field surveys were conducted in the main maize producing areas of Tianjin, China. Heavy metal concentrations in maize grains were predicted by coupling DGT with traditional extraction methods. The results show that coupling DGT with soil solution can significantly improve prediction accuracy (Cd-R2 = 0.908, Ni-R2 = 0.903, and Zn-R2 = 0.904). This indicated that DGT and soil solution were feasible predictors of heavy metal concentration in maize. The DGT induced fluxes in soil/sediment (DIFS) model was used to simulate the uptake process of heavy metals by DGT, and better reveal the desorption processes of heavy metals in soils. DIFS-based desorption processes were employed to characterize the resupply ability of heavy metals in soils. The coupling of DGT and DIFS parameters provided the best prediction accuracy in this study (Cd-R2 = 0.920, Ni-R2 = 0.928, and Zn-R2 = 0.908). Predictions are slightly weaker for Zn than for Cd and Ni (Cd-P < 0.01, Ni-P < 0.01, and Zn-P < 0.05). The reason is that the average resupply type of Cd and Ni in soil is partially sustained while Zn is resupplied via diffusion only. The desorption rate k-1 can excellently improve the prediction accuracy of DGT, which avoids the disadvantage that soil solution does not consider desorption. The coupling of DGT and DIFS parameters provides an accurate and reliable method for predicting heavy metal enrichment in maize."

Due to its high mobility, leaching of this element in the field might be important, potentially affecting the reliability of estimated transfer parameters of (99)Tc as measured in closed experimental systems such as hydroponics or pot experiments. The aim of this experiment was to measure the leaching of (99)Tc in undisturbed irrigated soil cores under cultivation as well as plant uptake and to study the possible competition between the two transfer pathways. Undisturbed soil cores (50 x 50 cm) were sampled from a Rendzic Leptosol (R), a colluvial Fluvic Cambisol (F) and a Dystric Cambisol (D) using PVC tubes (three cores sampled per soil type). Each core was equipped with a leachate collector at the bottom, allowing the monitoring of (99)Tc leaching through the cores. Cores were placed in a greenhouse and maize (Zea mays L. , cv. DEA, Pioneer) was sown. After 135 d, maize was harvested and radioactivity determined in both plant and water samples. Results showed that during the growing period, leaching of (99)Tc was limited, due to the high evapotranspiration rate of maize. After harvest, leaching of (99)Tc went on because of the absence of evapotranspiration. Effective uptake (EU) of (99)Tc in leaves and grains was calculated. EU reached 70% of the input in the leaves and was not significantly different among soils. These results confirmed those obtained from pot experiments, even though leaching was allowed to occur in close-to-reality hydraulical conditions. As a consequence, it was concluded that pot experiments are an adequate surrogate for more complex ""close-to-reality"" experimental systems for measuring transfer factors."

To this end, global proteomic analysis employing LC-MS/MS of gluten-enriched extracts derived from 12 barley cultivars was undertaken, providing a foundation for the development of MS-based quantitative methodologies that would enable the detection of barley contamination in foods. Subsequently, a number of candidate barley-specific peptide markers were evaluated by multiple-reaction monitoring MS. From an initial panel of 26, 9 peptide markers were unique to barley, yet present in a wide range of barley varieties.

However, robust uptake of highly halogenated compounds at the reproductive stages suggests a delayed accumulation of them by the plants. PBDE and PCB congener profiles suggest more noticeable tendency for inter-compartment translocation in peanut than in corn during the plant development. The DP and HBCD isomeric compositions in peanut (enriched with syn-DP and Œ≥-HBCD) were different from those in the rhizosphere soils and air, suggesting a more stereoisomer-selective uptake and/or biotransformation in this species compared to corn. The bioaccumulation factors for root-soil and stem-root of these HOCs in most cases were <1. The tissue-distributions demonstrated that leaves serve as a significant reservoir of absorbed HOCs under the field conditions, whereas the low concentrations in peanut and corn kernels indicated translocation of most HOCs into this compartment was significantly hindered (especially for highly halogenated compounds)."

An endophytic bacterium MS455, isolated from soybean, exhibited broad-spectrum antifungal activity against economically important pathogens, including Aspergillus flavus. MS455 was identified as a strain of Burkholderia based on genomic analysis. Random and site-specific mutations were used in discovery of the genes that share high homology to the ocf gene cluster of Burkholderia contaminans strain MS14, which is responsible for production of the antifungal compound occidiofungin. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that ORF1, a homolog to the ambR1 LuxR-type regulatory gene, regulates occidiofungin biosynthesis in MS455. Additionally, 284 differentially expressed genes, including 138 upregulated and 146 downregulated genes, suggesting that, in addition to its role in occidiofungin production, ORF1 is involved in expression of multiple genes, especially those involved in ornibactin biosynthesis. Plate bioassays showed the growth of A. flavus was significantly inhibited by the wild-type strain MS455 as compared with the ORF1 mutant. Similarly, corn kernel assays showed that growth of A. flavus and aflatoxin production were reduced significantly by MS455 as compared with buffer control and the ORF1 mutant.

Indirectly, climate change may influence such hazards (e. g. the occurrence of mycotoxins) due to geographic shifts in the distribution of major cereal cropping systems and the consequences this may have for crop rotations. This paper analyses the impact of climate on cropping shares of maize, oat and wheat on a 50-km square grid across Europe (45-65¬∞N) and provides model-based estimates of the changes in cropping shares in response to changes in temperature and precipitation as projected for the time period around 2040 by two regional climate models (RCM) with a moderate and a strong climate change signal, respectively. The projected cropping shares are based on the output from the two RCMs and on algorithms derived for the relation between meteorological data and observed cropping shares of maize, oat and wheat. The observed cropping shares show a south-to-north gradient, where maize had its maximum at 45-55¬∞N, oat had its maximum at 55-65¬∞N, and wheat was more evenly distributed along the latitudes in Europe. Under the projected climate changes, there was a general increase in maize cropping shares, whereas for oat no areas showed distinct increases. For wheat, the projected changes indicated a tendency towards higher cropping shares in the northern parts and lower cropping shares in the southern parts of the study area. The present modelling approach represents a simplification of factors determining the distribution of cereal crops, and also some uncertainties in the data basis were apparent. A promising way of future model improvement could be through a systematic analysis and inclusion of other variables, such as key soil properties and socio-economic conditions, influencing the comparative advantages of specific crops."

Present study was undertaken to classify 240 maize kernels inoculated with six different concentrations (25, 40, 70, 200, 300 and 500¬†ppb) of aflatoxin-B1 by using Vis-NIR HSI. The reflectance spectral data were pre-processed (multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), standard normal variate (SNV), Savitsky-Golay smoothing and their combinations) and classified using partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and k-nearest neighbour (k-NN). PLS model was also developed to predict the concentration of aflatoxin-B1in naturally contaminated maize kernels inoculated with Aspergillus flavus. The potential wavelength (508¬†nm) was selected based on principal component analysis (PCA) loadings to distinguish between sterile and infected maize kernels. PCA score plots revealed a distinct separation of low contaminated samples (25, 40 and 70¬†ppb) from highly contaminated samples (200, 300 and 500¬†ppb) without any overlapping of data. The maximum classification accuracy of 94.7% was obtained using PLS-DA with SNV pre-processed data. Across all the combinations of pre-processing and classification models, the best efficiency (98.2%) was exhibited by k-NN model with raw data. The developed PLS model depicted good prediction accuracy ( RCV2 =‚Äâ0.820, SECV‚Äâ=‚Äâ79.425, RPDCV‚Äâ=‚Äâ2.382) during Venetian-blinds cross-validation. The results of pixel-wise classification (k-NN) and concentration distribution maps (PLS with raw spectra) were quite close to the result obtained by reference method (HPLC analysis) of aflatoxin-B1 detection."

The goal of this study was to evaluate the tissue-level spatial distribution of metal(loids) in corn seeds (Zea mays, L. ) from contaminated corn fields near the Xikuangshan (XKS) antimony mine in Hunan, China, and compared them with corn (Zea mays everta L. , popcorn) grown in a farm in Amherst, MA that practices sustainable farming as a control. How toxic and essential metals translocate through the roots and shoots during early stages of germination was also investigated. The cleaned corn seed samples were mounted in resin blocks and longitudinally dissected into thin sections. The laser ablation parameters were optimized, and the instrument was calibrated using tomato leaf standard reference material (NIST SRM 1573a) in a pellet form. Tissue level distributions of metal(loid)s As, Cd, Hg, Sb and Zn in corn seeds collected were determined using (LA-ICP-MS). Seeds from the control farm were germinated and their roots and shoots were analyzed to determine tissue level concentrations and their spatial distributions. It was found that seeds from the XKS mine region in China had higher overall concentration of all elements analyzed due to metal(loids) absorbed from contaminated mine soils. Metal(loids) concentrations were highest in the embryo (‚àº360‚ÄØmg/kg) and pericarp (‚àº0.48‚ÄØmg/kg) compared with the endosperm of corn seeds. Essential element Zn was found in the embryo and emerging coleoptile and radicle. Finally, in both roots and shoots, element concentrations were highest proximally to the tip cap compared to distal concentrations and later translocated to distal tissue regions. This study offers unique insights of metal(loid) bioaccumulation and translocation in corn and thus is better able to track metal(loids) contaminants trafficking in our food systems."

Previous studies conducted in Nigeria and Ghana found high concentrations of aflatoxins in pre- and post-harvest maize. However, little information is available on the population structure of Aspergillus Sect. Flavi in West Africa. We determined the incidence of Aspergillus Sect. Flavi and the level of aflatoxin contamination in 91 maize samples from farms and markets in Nigeria and Ghana. Aspergillus spp. were recovered from 61/91 maize samples and aflatoxins B1 and/or B2 occurred in 36/91 samples. Three samples from the farms also contained aflatoxin G1 and/or G2. Farm samples were more highly contaminated than were samples from the market, in terms of both the percentage of the samples contaminated and the level of mycotoxin contamination. One-hundred-and-thirty-five strains representative of the 1163 strains collected were identified by using a multilocus sequence analysis of portions of the genes encoding calmodulin, Œ≤-tubulin and actin, and evaluated for aflatoxin production. Of the 135 strains, there were 110 - Aspergillus flavus, 20 - Aspergillus tamarii, 2 - Aspergillus wentii, 2 - Aspergillus flavofurcatus, and 1 - Aspergillus parvisclerotigenus. Twenty-five of the A.¬†flavus strains and the A.¬†parvisclerotigenus strain were the only strains that produced aflatoxins. The higher contamination of the farm than the market samples suggests that the aflatoxin exposure of rural farmers is even higher than previously estimated based on reported contamination of market samples. The relative infrequency of the A.¬†flavus SBG strains, producing small sclerotia and high levels of both aflatoxins (B and G), suggests that long-term chronic exposure to this mycotoxin are a much higher health risk in West Africa than is the acute toxicity due to very highly contaminated maize in east Africa."

Our framework is based on a pollutant's characterization factor (CF) and three new metrics: Available Regulatory Capacity for Incremental Emissions (ARCIE), Source CF Ratio, and Activity Health Impact (AHI) Ratio. ARCIE can be used to assess whether a receptor location has capacity to accommodate additional source emissions while complying with regulatory limits. We present CF as a midpoint indicator of health impacts per unit mass of emitted pollutant. Source CF Ratio enables comparison of potential new-source locations based on human health impacts. The AHI Ratio estimates the health impacts of a pollutant in relation to the utilization of the source for each unit of product or service. These metrics can be applied to any pollutant, energy source sector (e. g. , agriculture, electricity), source type (point, line, area), and spatial modeling domain (nation, state, city, region). We demonstrate these metrics through a case study of fine particulate (PM2.5) emissions from U. S. corn stover harvesting and local processing at various scales, representing steps in the biofuel production process. We model PM2.5 formation in the atmosphere using a novel reduced-complexity chemical transport model called the Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP). Through this case study, we present the first area-source PM2.5 CFs that address the recommendations of several LCIA studies to establish spatially explicit CFs specific to an energy source sector or type. Overall, the framework developed in this work provides multiple new ways to consider the potential impacts of air emissions through spatially differentiated metrics."

Using the Denitrification and Decomposition (DNDC) model, average annual NO‚ÇÉ-N leaching estimates in the high N treatments were 21.7‚Äâkg N ha‚Åª¬π for maize and 3.7 and 0.2‚Äâkg N ha‚Åª¬π for switchgrass and IWG, respectively. Despite consistent biomass yields through time, IWG grain yields decreased with stand age at all N fertilizer treatments.

Model evaluation was conducted via comparing exposure and dose-modeling predictions against duplicate diet data and biomarker measurements, respectively, for the same individuals. The mean modeled tAs exposure from food is 0.38 microg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times higher than the mean As exposures from the drinking water. The mean iAs exposure from food is 0.05 microg/kg/day (1.96 microg/day), which is approximately two times higher than the mean iAs exposures from the drinking water. The modeled exposure and dose estimates matched well with the duplicate diet data and measured As biomarkers. The major food contributors to iAs exposure were the following: vegetables (24%); fruit juices and fruits (18%); rice (17%); beer and wine (12%); and flour, corn, and wheat (11%).

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The potential presence of mycotoxins in maize is a major health concern for the producers as well as consumers. Mycotoxins presence in food supply chain is result of poor storage condition favoring growth of mold. The mold produces secondary metabolites, mycotoxins. Mycotoxins once become part of maize will be carried out with supply chain. Therefore, monitoring of mycotoxins is necessary to assess their concentration so that food can be made safe for the consumer. Other than quantification of mycotoxins, analysis of mycotoxins behavior toward processing or heat have significant importance for the maize processing industry. This study provides quantification and fate of mycotoxins during processing of maize and nixtamalization.

The low fumonisin levels may be ascribed to the use of good agricultural practices. Of the Fusarium species present, those in maize consisted mainly of fumonisin producers, the opposite of what was observed in pearl millet and sorghum.

Conclusively, cell wall of barley industry by‚Äêproduct is more nutritious than that of wheat and maize industry by‚Äêproduct cell walls. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Cereals are the most abundant commodities widely used in the world as staple foods. Cereal bran cell wall has important bioactive components, which have the ability to combat different life‚Äêthreatening diseases. Utilization of cell wall in cereal‚Äêbased products can fulfill many objectives including improving product quality, shelf life, value addition, and maintaining good health of the consumers. Novel products with improved rheology can be introduced in market as functional foods against various diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cancer, and bacterial infections. Cereal bran cell wall can be probed in the baking industry to enhance the shelf life and stability of the baked goods."

Though the mycotoxins present in the feed and food chain are well documented, the human physiological effects of mycotoxin exposure are not yet fully understood. It is known that mycotoxins have nephrotoxic, genotoxic, teratogenic, carcinogenic, and cytotoxic properties and, as a consequence, these toxins may cause liver carcinomas, renal dysfunctions, and also immunosuppressed states. The deleterious physiological effects of mycotoxins on humans are still a first-priority question. In food production and also in the case of acute and chronic poisoning, there are possibilities to set suitable food safety measures into operation to minimize the effects of mycotoxin contaminations. On the other hand, preventive actions are always better, due to the multivariate nature of mycotoxin exposures. In this review, the occurrence and toxicological features of major Aspergillus-derived mycotoxins are summarized and, furthermore, the possibilities of treatments in the medical practice to heal the deleterious consequences of acute and/or chronic exposures are presented."

Here, we explored the efficiency of various biosorbents (egg shell, java plum seed, water chestnut shell, corn cob, tea waste and pomegranate peel) for arsenate (As(V)) and arsenite (As(III)) removal from As-contaminated water. Significantly, egg shell and java plum seed displayed the greatest As(III) elimination (78-87%) at 7 pH followed by water chestnut shell (75%), corn cob (67%), tea waste (74%) and pomegranate peel (65%). In contrast, 71% and 67% of As(V) was removed at pH‚ÄØ4.1 and 5.3 by egg shell and java plum seed, respectively. The maximum As(V) and As(III) sorption by all the biosorbents was obtained, notably for egg shell and java plum seed, after 2‚ÄØh contact time. Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second order models best fitted the sorption data for both forms of As. The -OH, -COOH, -NH2 and sulfur-bearing surface functional groups were possibly involved for As(III) and As(V) removal by biosorbents. The scanning electron microscopy combined with the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) analysis showed that the heterogeneous surface of biosorbents, possessing rough and irregular areas, could have led to As sorption. Both As(V) and As(III) were successfully desorbed (up to 97%) from the biosorbents in four sorption/desorption (regeneration) cycles. This pilot-scale study highlights that egg shell and java plum seed have the greatest ability to remove both As species from As-contaminated drinking water. Importantly, these findings provide insights to develop an inexpensive, effective and sustainable filtration technology for the treatment of As in drinking water, particularly in developing countries like Pakistan."

Several disease incidence models have been commercialized for wheat, but only one toxin prediction model from Ontario, Canada, ""DONcast"", has been validated extensively and commercialized to date for wheat, and another has been proposed for maize. In the development of these predictive tools, the variation in toxin levels associated with year and agronomic effects was estimated from simple linear models using wheat and maize samples taken from farm fields. In wheat, environment effects accounted for 48% of the variation in deoxynivalenol (DON) across all fields, followed by variety (27%), and previous crop (14 to 28%). In maize, hybrid accounted for 25% of the variation of either DON or fumonisin, followed by environment (12%), and when combined 42% of the variability was accounted for. The robust site-specific, DON forecast model accounted for up to 80% of the variation in DON, and has been used commercially for 5 years in Canada. Forecasting DON and fumonisins in maize is more difficult, because of its greater exposure to infection, the role of wounding in infection, the more important role of hybrid susceptibility, and the vast array of uncharacterized hybrids available in the marketplace. Nevertheless, using data collected from controlled experiments conducted in Argentina and the Philippines, a model was developed to predict fumonisin concentration using insect damage and weather variables, accounting for 82% of the variability of fumonisins. Using mycotoxins as a measure of disease outcome, as opposed to disease symptoms, offers a more robust prediction of mycotoxin risk, and it accounts for mycotoxin accumulation that occurs frequently in the absence of any change in Fusarium symptoms."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different doses of PCBs on the parameters of oxidative stress and to investigate whether these effects are dose dependent. Furthermore, a comparison between calculated benchmark doses (BMD) and estimated NOAEL values for investigated parameters, was made. Six groups of male albino Wistar rats (7 animals per group) were receiving Aroclor 1254 dissolved in corn oil in the doses of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 mg PCBs/kg b. w. /day by oral gavage during 28 days while control animals were receiving corn oil only.

Hepatic enzymes AST, ALT, ALP and protein albumin were also determined in serum as clinical parameters of liver function. Collected data on the investigated parameters were analyzed by the BMD method. The results of this study demonstrate that subacute exposure to PCBs causes induction of oxidative stress in liver with dose-dependent changes of the investigated parameters, although more pronounced adverse effects were observed on enzymatic than on non-enzymatic components of antioxidant protection. The obtained values for BMD and NOAEL support the use of BMD concept in the prediction of health risks associated with PCBs exposure.

It is produced as part of the tripeptide L-phosphinothricyl-L-alanyl-L-alanin, which was first isolated from Streptomyces viridichromogenes or Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Its structure is confirmed by degradation and synthesis. Several processes for the preparation of D,L- and L-phosphinothricin are described. Glufosinate is a structural analog of glutamate and inhibits the glutamine synthetase. The result is a rapid build-up of a high ammonia level and a concomitant depletion of glutamine and several other amino acids in the plant. These effects are accompanied by a rapid decline of photosynthetic CO2-fixation and are followed by chlorosis and desiccation. The results of numerous toxicological studies show that glufosinate ammonium and its commercial formulations are safe for users and consumers under the conditions of recommended use. The fast and complete degradation in soil and surface water prevents movement of residues into groundwater. The toxicological threshold levels for all the nontarget organisms tested are well above the potential exposure levels and therefore do not reflect any hazard for nontarget organisms in the ecosystem. Basta is a nonselective foliar applied herbicide for the control of undesirable mono- and dicotyledonous plants in orchards, vineyards, and plantations for minimum tillage, and as a harvest aid. A synthetic phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT) gene has been introduced via Agrobacterium tumefaciens into dicot crops, such as like tobacco, tomato, spring and winter rapeseed, alfalfa, and several horticultural crops.

In 2004, AF-alb levels were markedly higher than in 2002 [539.7 (463.3, 628.7) vs. 114.5 (99.7, 131.4) pg/mg; p < 0.001] but with no significant difference between the villages or between hepatomegaly and normal groups [539.7 (436.7, 666.9) vs. 512.6 (297.3, 883.8) pg/mg], possibly because acute exposures during an aflatoxicosis outbreak in 2004 may have masked any potential underlying relationship. Exposure to aflatoxin was associated with childhood chronic hepatomegaly in 2002. These preliminary data suggest an additional health risk that may be related to aflatoxin exposure in children, a hypothesis that merits further testing."

This study aimed to investigate the impacts of climate change on aflatoxin B1 production in maize and its consequences on aflatoxin M1 contamination in dairy cow's milk, using a full chain modelling approach. To this end, available models and input data were chained together in a modelling framework. As a case study, we focused on maize grown in Eastern Europe and imported to the Netherlands to be fed-as part of dairy cows' compound feed-to dairy cows in the Netherlands. Three different climate models, one aflatoxin B1 prediction model and five different carryover models were used. For this particular case study of East European maize, most of the calculations suggest an increase (up to 50%) of maximum mean aflatoxin M1 in milk by 2030, except for one climate (DMI) model suggesting a decrease. Results from all combinations of carryover and climate models suggest a similar or slight increase (up to 0.6%) of the chance of finding aflatoxin M1 in milk above the EC limit of 0.05 Œºg/kg by 2030. Results varied mainly with the climate model data and carryover model considered. The model framework infrastructure is flexible so that forecasting models for other mycotoxins or other food safety hazards as well as other production chains, together with necessary input databases, can easily be included as well. This modelling framework for the first time links datasets and models related to aflatoxin B1 in maize and related aflatoxin M1 the dairy production chain to obtain a unique predictive methodology based on Monte Carlo simulation. Such an integrated approach with scenario analysis provides possibilities for policy makers and risk managers to study the effects of changes in the beginning of the chain on the end product."

The toxic effects of ZnO NPs on seed germination, plant growth, and biochemical parameters, including photosynthetic pigments, protein and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, reactive oxygen species (ROS), enzymes of the antioxidant defence system, as well as the Zn translocation in the plants were investigated using pots containing non-contaminated or ZnO NP-contaminated soil at concentrations of 20, 225, 450, and 900‚ÄØmg‚ÄØZn‚ÄØkg-1. Two soils with different physicochemical properties, namely a calcareous soil and an acidic soil, were used. The total and available Zn in the soils were correlated with the Zn in the plants (roots and shoots) and the observed effects. In the calcareous soil, the available Zn was very low and the phytotoxicity was limited to a slight reduction in the biomass for wheat, cucumber, and beet at the highest concentration. Only beet showed an increase in photosynthetic pigments. The parameters related to oxidative stress were affected to different degrees depending on the crop, with the exceptions of maize, lettuce, pea, and beet. In the acidic soil, the available Zn was high, and the germination of bean, tomato, lettuce, and beet, and the growth of most of the crops were seriously affected. The calculated EC50 values (growth) in the acidic soil ranged from 110 to 520‚ÄØmg‚ÄØZn‚ÄØkg-1. The photosynthetic pigments and most of the markers of oxidative stress were negatively affected in maize, wheat, bean, and pea.

To test this hypothesis, a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial study was conducted. Rats were fed diets with adequate or marginal amounts of dietary Zn, Fe, or Ca. The basal diets contained 40% unenriched, milled rice fortified with 0.62 mg of Cd/kg as CdCl2 (0.25 mg of Cd/kg diet). Rat consumed the diets for 5 weeks and then were fed 1 g of a similar diet containing 10(9)Cd-labeled rice. After 2 weeks, whole-body (WB) retention of 109Cd was determine. Rats then were killed, and the organs were removed for total Cd determinations. Rats fed marginal concentrations of dietary Zn had slightly but significantly more WB retention of 109Cd than controls; however, rats fed marginal Fe or Ca had as much as 3-fold higher retention of the label. Rats fed marginal amounts of Zn, Fe, and Ca combined retained as much as 8 times more 109Cd than rats fed adequate minerals. The effects on Cd concentrations in liver and kidney were similar to the effects on 109Cd retention. These results support the hypothesis that populations exposed to dietary sources of Cd and subsisting on marginal mineral intakes could be at greater risk than well-nourished populations exposed to similar amounts of dietary Cd. Thus, different food crops can cause unequal Cd risk at equal Cd concentration if diets containing the food are not balanced to provide adequate interacting mineral concentrations."

The novel feature of this method is that the sample purification is carried out as a part of the assay, and a separate sample cleanup step is not required. The assay procedure involves the sequential addition of standard or sample, cleaning solutions, and aflatoxin B1-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (AFB1-HRP) over antibody-spotted zones of a membrane, and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine was used as the substrate for visualization. We have determined that trifluoroacetic acid and propionic acids at concentrations of 100 mM are highly effective for cleaning groundnut, wheat, corn, and poultry feed samples and that NaHCO3 (100 mM) is successful in cleaning processed soybean. In all cases, subsequent washing was performed with phosphate-buffered saline solution to facilitate the removal of traces of adhering interfering substances. A batch of 12 samples can be analyzed within 8 min either by visual comparison of the color intensity (inversely related to the analyte concentration) of a sample spot with those of reference standards or, more precisely, by densitometry. The method was tested for the analysis of AFB1 in groundnut, wheat, corn, processed soybean, chili, and poultry feed. The detection limit obtained was 5 microg/kg, except for chili, where it was 10 microg/kg. The average recoveries from different noninfected food samples spiked with AFB1 at concentrations of 5 to 100 microg/kg were between 99 and 105%.

Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) has been implicated in the etiology of acute and chronic disease in humans and animals, including growth stunting, liver cancer and death. Cost effective and culturally acceptable intervention strategies for the reduction of dietary AFB1 exposure are of critical need in populations at high risk for aflatoxicosis. Fermented gruels consisting of cornmeal are a common source for such exposure and are consumed by both children and adults in many countries with a history of frequent, high-level aflatoxin exposure. One proposed method to reduce aflatoxins in the diet is to include a selective enterosorbent, Uniform Particle Size NovaSil (UPSN), as a food additive in contaminated foods. For UPSN to be effective in this capacity, it must be stable in complex, acidic mixtures that are often exposed to heat during the process of fermented gruel preparation. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to test the ability of UPSN to sorb aflatoxin while common cooking conditions were applied. The influence of fermentation, heat treatment, acidity, and processing time were investigated with and without UPSN. Analyses were performed using the field-practical Vicam assay with HPLC verification of trends. Our findings demonstrated that UPSN significantly reduced aflatoxin levels (47-100%) in cornmeal, regardless of processing conditions. Upon comparison of each element tested, time appeared to be the primary factor influencing UPSN efficacy. The greatest decreases in AFB1 were reported in samples allowed to incubate (with or without fermentation) for 72 hrs. This data suggests that addition of UPSN to staple corn ingredients likely to contain aflatoxins would be a sustainable approach to reduce exposure."

Cadmium stress significantly inhibited plant growth across all genotypes. Genotypic variation in response to Cd toxicity was apparent: shoot dry weight varied from 0.13 (genotype NS2020) to 0.35‚Äâg plant-1 (Dongke301) with deductions up to 63% compared with non-Cd treatment (CK). Root dry weight¬†of 20 genotypes ranged from 0.06 (NS2020) to 0.18‚Äâg plant-1 (Dongke301) with a deduction up to 56%. Root length ranged from 2.21 (NS590b) to 9.22‚Äâm (Dongke301) with a maximal decline of 76%. Cadmium-treated genotypes generally had thicker roots and average diameter increased by 34% compared with CK. Genotypes had up to 3.25 and 3.50 times differences in shoot and root Cd concentrations, respectively. Principal component and cluster analyses assigned the 20 genotypes into Cd-tolerant (five genotypes) and Cd-sensitive (15 genotypes) groups. Maize genotypes varied significantly in response to moderate Cd stress. Cadmium-tolerant genotypes optimized root morphology and Cd accumulation and distribution. This study could assist in the selection and breeding of new cultivars with improved adaptation to Cd-contaminated soil for food and feed or land remediation purposes.and Agriculture published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry."

The use of chemical control agents is more effective in the larval instar than for the adult insects, due to limited mobility of the larvae in water and their higher sensitivity. Besides, acting in the initial phase is preferable because the mosquito is not yet a vector of diseases. Ae. aegypti, however, developed resistance to common synthetic larvicides that furthermore have a negative impact on both the environment and human health. It is, therefore, necessary to search for new and eco-friendly replacements. Essential oils that are used as natural larvicides are often limited in their applicability as they are poorly water-soluble, degrade easily and volatilize when applied as free oil. These limitations can, however, be overcome using microencapsulation. Thyme essential oil (TEO) contains thymol, an active compound that has a range of biological activities (antioxidant, antimicrobial, insecticidal). The objective of this work was to develop a low-cost bio-degradable larvicide system for controlled release of TEO that is to be applied in small containers in and around households. The controlled release system was prepared by thermoplastic extrusion using corn starch as wall material. The TEO was chemically determined by gas-chromatography to contain 53% w/w of thymol, and its larvicidal activity was determined. The release of the thymol from the particles is demonstrated to correlate with the swelling of the matrix when immersed in water. The particles are effective against larvae from susceptible (Rockefeller) and resistant strains, reduce the required lethal concentration by a factor 3 as compared with the non-encapsulated TEO and significantly prolonged the residual effect, maintaining 100% of larvae mortality for 10 days more than non-encapsulated TEO."

The objectives of this research were thus to study the populations of Aspergillus section Flavi in six northern Italian regions and obtain information on the relative role of the key species, ability to produce sclerotia, production of the main toxic secondary metabolites, aflatoxins and cyclopiazonic acid, and tolerance of key environmental parameters. A total of 70 strains were isolated and they included the toxigenic species A. flavus and A. parasiticus. A. flavus was dominant in the populations studied, representing 93% of the strains. Seventy percent of strains of Aspergillus section Flavi produced AFs, with 50% of strains also producing cyclopiazonic acid. Sixty-two percent of A. flavus strains and 80% of A. parasiticus were able to produce sclerotia at 30 degrees C. Using 5/2 agar, only 1 strain developed S sclerotia and 19 L sclerotia. With regard to ecological studies, growth of Aspergillus section Flavi was optimal at between 25 and 30 degrees C, while AFB(1) production was optimal at 25 degrees C. Regarding water availability (water activity, a(w)), 0.99 a(w) was optimal for both growth and AFs production, while the only aflatoxin produced in the driest condition tested (0.83 a(w)) was AFB(1). This information will be very useful in identifying regions at risk in northern Italy by linking climatic regional information to levels of fungal contamination present and potential for aflatoxin production in maize destined for animal feed.

Sixty neonate larvae of yellow stem borer were artificially infested into each plant in three installments. Data was recorded in terms of dead hearts and white heads at vegetative and flowering stage respectively. Transgenic lines exhibited inherent ability to protect rice plants from target insects (p<0.01). Natural infestations of rice skipper and rice leaf folder were also observed and transgenic plants were statistically superior to their untransformed counterparts. Green house whole plant bioassays were done by infesting two 2nd instar larvae of rice leaf folder per tiller. Transgenics were 96% more resistant than untransformed control plants. The presence of cry genes was observed with Dot blot, PCR and Southern blot analysis, while ELISA and Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of Cry proteins. All lines expressed higher level of Cry proteins when compared with commercially released cultivars of Bt cotton, maize and potato. It was also observed that although toxin titer substantially decreased with increasing age of the plants, it remained well within the limits to kill the target insects. Morphological studies showed significant variation for days to maturity, plant height and panicle length. Cooking qualities of seeds harvested from these lines were compared with the untransformed control. The transgenic lines had no effect on non-target insects (insects belonging to orders other than diptera and lepidoptera) and germination of three local varieties of wheat.

Elevated Cr contents resulted in significantly high pollution and noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks in the studied area. Chromium in most soils occurred predominately as Cr3+ (60-74%), and to a lesser extent, Cr6+. The mechanism responsible for decreasing Cr6+ percentages in soils with increasing depth was summarized: Cr6+ favors aqueous environment; soil moisture decreased with increasing depth; in soils especially in the lower portion, Cr6+ was reduced by Fe0 and Fe2, transforming into Cr3+ and Fe3+. In addition, the alkaline condition promoted Cr3+ to precipitate, resulting more Cr3+ absorbing in soils. The intimate association of Cr and Fe in soils (i. e. , Cr mainly occurred in Fe oxides and dolomite) further confirmed our assumptions. A combined application of microorganism (e. g. , Aeromonas hydrophila) and biochar (prepared from maize stalk or peanut shells) were recommended to alleviate Cr pollution in the soils."

This technology has gained rapid acceptance based on observations that activated carbon amendments predictably lower PCDD/F concentrations in water and bioaccumulation by simple aquatic organisms and earthworms; it has been assumed that bioavailability to mammals is similarly reduced, although this has been disproven for other sorbent materials. In the present study TCDD was absorbed to a microporous activated carbon (TCDD-AC) using the incipient wetness method. An aqueous suspension of TCDD-AC and an equivalent dosage of TCDD in corn oil were administered by oral gavage to B6C3F1 mice. The relative bioavailability of TCDD-AC was determined by quantifying and comparing the hepatic induction of cyp1A1 (messenger ribonucleic acid) and suppression of the immunoglobulin M antibody-forming cell immune response by the 2 forms of TCDD. A concentration-dependent response was observed for both assays when TCDD in corn oil was administered to mice. However, when equivalent masses of TCDD were administered as TCDD-AC, no induction of cyp1A1 or suppression of the immunoglobulin M antibody-forming cell response was observed. The absence of these 2 sensitive aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated responses in mice provides the first direct evidence that activated carbon can sequester TCDD in a form that eliminates its bioavailability to mammals. These results support the premise that activated carbon can be used to reduce the bioeffective dose of TCDD delivered to mammals and that activated carbon amendments may provide a low-cost alternative to traditional remediation technologies.

This work aimed at characterizing and assessing the effect of digestates obtained from a local biogas plant (Biogas Wipptal, Gmbh), either in the form of liquid fraction or as a solid pellet on: (i) the fertility of the soils during an incubation experiment; (ii) the plant growth and nutritional status of different species (maize and cucumber). Moreover, an extensive characterization of the pellet was performed via X-ray microanalytical techniques. The data obtained showed that both digestates exhibit a fertilizing potential for crops, depending on the plant species and the fertilizer dose: the liquid fraction increases the shoot fresh weight at low dose in cucumber, conversely, the solid pellet increases the shoot fresh weight at high dose in maize. The liquid digestate may have the advantage to release nutrients (i. e. nitrogen) more rapidly to plants, but its storage represents the main constraint (i. e. ammonia volatilization). Indeed, pelleting the digestates could improve the storability of the fertilizer besides enhancing plant nutrient availability (i. e. phosphate and potassium), plant biomass and soil biochemical quality (i. e. microbial biomass and activity).

Soil Pb and Zn fractions were determined using a sequential extraction scheme. Release of the metals in the soil was examined in a column leaching study. After only 7 days of seedling growth, shoot biomass was decreased by all EDTA treatments compared with the zero-EDTA control. The amount of shoot biomass produced was highest with uncoated EDTA, intermediate with CCA, and lowest with the EDTA solution. Shoot Pb contents were highest with solid EDTA, intermediate with CCA, and lowest with EDTA solution, and they were always higher with EDTA treatments than in controls. In contrast, shoot Zn contents following EDTA treatments were lower than in the control. Levels of soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in aqueous soil extracts were much lower after CCA application than following treatments with solid EDTA and EDTA solution. After 17 days of plant growth, when most of the chelating agent had been released from the CCA, soil organic carbon levels remained relatively constant and similar to those in the control, indicating that a relatively low chelating agent concentration can be maintained for the plants to take up the metals. The distribution of Pb in the sequential extraction procedure showed that the Pb level in the exchangeable+carbonate-bound fraction with CCA was significantly lower than that with solid EDTA or EDTA solution, further indicating that slow release of CCA improves the bioavailability of metals in the soil to match plant uptake of those metals. The results suggest that CCA can enhance shoot content of Pb but not of Zn from the contaminated soil in the short term, and may also reduce the risk of metal leaching from the soil."

This increases food prices and reduces the availability of food. Therefore, knowledge concerning the nutritional and technological potential of non-traditional crops and their resistance to heat and drought is very interesting. Pearl millet is known to produce small nutritious cereal grains, which can endure both heat and dry conditions, and is one of the basic cereals of several African and Asian countries. Although this species has been cultivated in Brazil for at least 50‚ÄØyears it is only used as a cover crop and animal feed, but not for human consumption. Nonetheless, pearl millet grains have a high potential as food for humans because they are gluten-free, higher in dietary fiber content than rice, similar in lipid content to maize and higher content of essential amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and lysine) than other traditional cereals, such as wheat and rye. In addition, the crop is low cost and less susceptible to contamination by aflatoxins compared to corn, for example. Most grains, including pearl millet, can be milled, decorticated, germinated, fermented, cooked and extruded to obtain products such as flours, biscuits, snacks, pasta and non-dairy probiotic beverages. Pearl millet also has functional properties; it has a low glycemic index and therefore it can be used as an alternative food for weight control and to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as diabetes. Thus, this review intends to show the potential of pearl millet as an alternative food security crop, particularly in countries, like Brazil, where it is not commonly consumed. Also this review presents different processes and products that have been already reported in the literature in order to introduce the great potential of this important small grain to producers and consumers."

A three-year field experiment was conducted using an in situ leakage pond method at a typical farmland in Henan in 2017-2020.

Five N fertilizer rates were established with 0 (CK), 285 (LN), 465 (MN), 510 (MNO), and 645 (HN) kg N ha-1 for one rotation cycle. MNO was applied with chemical and organic fertilizers. The concentration of nitrate N in the soil leaching solution of CK, LN, MN, MNO, and HN was 0.81-, 1.49-, 3.65-, 5.55-, and 7.57-fold that of the World Health Organization's standard for underground drinking water. The exponential relationship between the N application rate and leaching was obtained when the annual N input exceeded 300 kg ha-1, and the N leaching rate increased greatly. The leaching rate of nitrate N in the total N was 50.6-82.4% under different treatments of N application. The combination of chemical and organic fertilizers treatment (MNO) reduced the amount of N that was leached in dry years.

However, these transgenic plants may have an impact on non-target organisms. In particular, a potential hazard was identified for non-target lepidopteran larvae, if they consume Bt maize pollen on their host plants. Risk can be defined as a function of the effect of an event (hazard) and the likelihood of this event occurring. Although data on toxicity (hazard) are available from many lab and field studies, knowledge about the environmental exposure of European lepidopteran larvae is incomplete at the population level. Therefore we studied the distribution of small tortoiseshell caterpillars (Aglais urticae (L. )) and its host plant in an agricultural landscape in Germany, to estimate the potential population exposure to maize pollen. The results showed that larvae of the small tortoiseshell developed primarily on freshly sprouted nettle stands (Urtica dioica (L. )) in field margins, rather than adjacent to hedges and groves. However, the main distribution was at margins of cereal (non-maize) fields, where 70% of all larvae were found. This may be due the fact that cereals covered 54% of the survey area, while maize only covered 6.1%. On the other hand, maize fields seem so show higher food plant densities than cereal crops. The results must be interpreted carefully, as the data basis of the present study is very small, and the situation can vary between years due to crop rotation or other changes in agricultural practices. Therefore it is still questionable whether the small tortoiseshell is significantly exposed to maize pollen. For a conclusive risk assessment, more replications and surveys of larger areas in different intensively managed agricultural landscapes over several years are needed."

These indices maybe used for an evaluation before use of pesticides by farmers and advisers. The present approach was initially validated for herbicides in maize crops, but it can readily be applied to other PPPs and crops. PESTi index underline the physical and chemical characteristics as a whole, not considering the impact of other factors such as application rate or period of application. Hence, this index may underestimate the risk associated to a certain chemical. AGROi has a precautionary approach. The risk associated to a specific mixture derives from a combination of intrinsic characteristics of the chemicals, agronomic impacts, regulation restrictions and potential hazard to water compartment. The ECOi index is focused on the ecotoxicological impact against non-target organisms. The helpfulness of this index stands in its ability to easily discriminate the ecotoxicological impact of chemicals using indicators commonly available in literature and without making complex calculations. PRISW-1 Index discriminate active substances according to their risk against three representative non-target organisms. However, due to the intrinsic characteristics of each pesticide, a high PRISW-1 value could not always mean an easy movement of the chemical via runoff waters. The information deriving from Priority index may certainly help public authorities to select chemicals to be detected in water monitoring campaigns. The application of these indices may represent a valid decision tool for public stakeholders in defining agricultural measures to reduce the externalities of pest control."

With serial dilutions of purified genomic DNA from F. verticillioides, F. graminearum, or both as the template, the detection limit of the assay was 5 pg of genomic DNA per reaction. The three products were detectable over four orders of magnitude of template concentration (5 pg to 5 ng of genomic DNA per reaction); at 50 ng template per reaction, only the TRI6 and FUM1 PCR products were detected.

Celiac people should consume products without gluten, which are elaborated mainly with maize or other cereals. Contamination of cereals with mycotoxins, such as fumonisins (FBs) and aflatoxins (AFs) is frequently reported worldwide. Therefore, food ingestion is the main source of mycotoxin exposure. A new analytical method was developed and validated for simultaneous analysis of 21 mycotoxins in gluten-free pasta, commonly consumed by celiac population as an alternative to conventional pasta. Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS) was used for analyte separation and detection. The mycotoxins included in this work were those widely reported to occur in cereal samples, namely, ochratoxin-A (OTA), aflatoxins (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1 and AFG2), zearalenone (ZON), deoxynivalenol (DON), 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3-AcDON and 15-AcDON, respectively), nivalenol (NIV), neosolaniol (NEO), fusarenone-X, (FUS-X), T-2 toxin (T-2) and HT-2 toxin (HT-2), fumonisin B1 and B2 (FB1 and FB2, respectively), enniatins (ENN A, ENN A1, ENN B and ENN B1) and beauvericin (BEA). The validated method was successfully applied to 84 gluten-free pasta samples collected from several local markets of Campania region (Italy) during September to November 2020 to monitor the occurrence of mycotoxins and to assess the exposure to these food contaminants. A significant number of samples (95%) showed mycotoxin contamination, being Fusarium mycotoxins (FB1, ZON and DON) the most commonly detected ones.

This is because many infant food products are rice based, and rice is ~10-fold elevated in inorganic arsenic compared to most other foods. The European Commission (EC) has acted on this concern setting stricter standards for infants, 100 Œºg of inorganic arsenic per kg of food (100 Œºg/kg), as compared to adults (200 Œºg/kg), for rice based foods, a law that was brought into place in 1st January 2016. Here we investigate how this law has impacted on inorganic arsenic in baby food products in the UK market, and compare the findings to previous baby food surveys taken before and just after the law came into place. We find that for a wide range of UK infant products that the new regulations are being adhered to, with all samples surveyed, being under 100 Œºg/kg inorganic arsenic. The prevalence of pure rice products had decreased in the UK, and there appears to be careful sourcing of the rice used in these products to ensure conformity with regulations. There has been an increased presence of mixed cereal products, with rice and maize as the main ingredient, appearing on the UK market, with varying rice contents for infant porridges, cakes and mueslis, with the latter being a relatively innovative product for infant foods. There was a highly significant correlation (P<0.0001) between rice content and inorganic arsenic concentration across all infant foods. When UK infant rice cakes, breakfast cereals and porridges were compare to their general, i. e. not labelled specifically for being for infant consumption, equivalent it was found that the adult foods generally exceeded the 100 Œºg/kg inorganic arsenic standard for infant foods. Thus, infants should not be given rice products not specifically labelled as being for them if a lower inorganic arsenic diet is to be maintained."

Eighteen potentially toxigenic Fusarium strains were isolated from maize (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ10), sorghum (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ7) and pearl millet (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1) growing in the same field in Nigeria. The 17 strains from maize and sorghum were all F. proliferatum and the one strain from pearl millet was F. pseudonygamai. Under conducive conditions, the 17 F. proliferatum strains produced fumonisins, 11 in relatively large quantities (700-17,000‚ÄØmg total fumonisins, i. e. , FB1‚ÄØ+‚ÄØFB2‚ÄØ+‚ÄØFB3/kg culture material), and six at <45‚ÄØmg/kg. Ten F. proliferatum strains produced >100‚ÄØmg of moniliformin per kg culture material with a maximum of 8900‚ÄØmg/kg culture material. All strains could use all grains for growth and toxin production, regardless of the host from which they were isolated. Isolates varied in the amount of toxin produced on each substrate, with toxin production a property of the strain and not the host from which the strain was recovered. However, the extent to which a toxin-producing phenotype could be altered by the grain on which the fungus was grown is consistent with subtle genetic‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØenvironment interactions that require a larger data set than the one presented here to rigorously identify. In conclusion, there is significant variation in the ability of strains of F. proliferatum to produce fumonisins and moniliformin on maize, sorghum and millet. If the amount of toxin produced on the various grains in this study reflects real-world settings, e. g. , poor storage, then the consumers of these contaminated grains could be exposed to mycotoxin levels that greatly exceed the tolerable daily intakes."

A number of stressors have been identified as potential contributing factors, including the extensive prophylactic use of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are highly toxic to bees, in agriculture. While multiple routes of exposure to these systemic insecticides have been documented for honey bees, contamination from puddle water has not been investigated. In this study, we used a multi-residue method based on LC-MS/MS to analyze samples of puddle water taken in the field during the planting of treated corn and one month later. If honey bees were to collect and drink water from these puddles, our results showed that they would be exposed to various agricultural pesticides. All water samples collected from corn fields were contaminated with at least one neonicotinoid compound, although most contained more than one systemic insecticide. Concentrations of neonicotinoids were higher in early spring, indicating that emission and drifting of contaminated dust during sowing raises contamination levels of puddles. Although the overall average acute risk of drinking water from puddles was relatively low, concentrations of neonicotinoids ranged from 0.01 to 63 ¬µg/L and were sufficient to potentially elicit a wide array of sublethal effects in individuals and colony alike. Our results also suggest that risk assessment of honey bee water resources underestimates the foragers' exposure and consequently miscalculates the risk. In fact, our data shows that honey bees and native pollinators are facing unprecedented cumulative exposure to these insecticides from combined residues in pollen, nectar and water. These findings not only document the impact of this route of exposure for honey bees, they also have implications for the cultivation of a wide variety of crops for which the extensive use of neonicotinoids is currently promoted."

Five composite samples, constructed to represent different mycotoxin contamination levels were degermed yielding degermed maize and the germ. The degermed maize was milled under laboratory conditions and four major milling fractions (SPECIAL, SUPER, semolina (SEM) and milling hominy feed) collected. The whole maize, degermed maize and total hominy feed (germ+milling hominy feed) were reconstructed to ensure homogenous samples for mycotoxin analyses. For comparison, commercial dry milling fractions (whole maize, SPECIAL, SUPER and total hominy feed), collected from three South African industrial mills, were analysed for the same mycotoxins and hence a more accurate assessment of the distribution between the different milling fractions. The distribution of the mycotoxins during the experimental dry milling of the degermed maize differs, with FB mainly concentrated in the SPECIAL, DON in the SEM whereas ZEA was equally distributed between the two milling fractions. Distribution of mycotoxins between the fractions obtained during commercial dry milling generally provided similar results with the total hominy feed containing the highest and the SUPER milling fractions the lowest mycotoxin levels although variations existed. Although milling is an effective way to reduce mycotoxins in maize, kernel characteristics and resultant fungal colonisation may impact on the distribution of specific mycotoxins among the different milling fractions. Differences in industrial dry milling practices and problems encountered in sampling bulk maize remain a large problem in assessing mycotoxin contamination in milling fractions intended for human consumption."

ESPM contains two chromogenic substrates (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxyl-beta-D-cellobioside), three sugars (sorbitol, D-arabitol, and adonitol), a pH indicator, and inhibitors (bile salts, vancomycin, and cefsulodin), which all contribute to its selectivity and differential properties. On ESPM, 79 pure culture strains of E. sakazakii (10 clinical isolates and others from food and environmental sources) yielded blue-black (three strains were blue-gray) raised colonies, 1 to 2 mm in diameter with and without halos after 24 h at 35 degrees C. Other enteric organisms plus Pseudomonas aeruginosa yielded white, yellow, green, or clear colonies with and without clear halos. Of these genera, only Shigella sonnei and one Pantoea strain produced blue-black to blue-gray colonies. ESPM was used to isolate E. sakazakii from a variety of foods: corn, wheat, and rice flours; powdered infant formula; dairy products (dried milk, whey, and caseinates); cereals; and environmental sources. Most false-positive results on ESPM were eliminated by observing acid production on either sucrose or melibiose after 6 h at 35 degrees C on a R&F E. sakazakii screening medium (ESSM) biplate. In an analysis of 240 samples, the number of samples positive for E. sakazakii by the ESPM-ESSM method and the U. S. Food and Drug Administration protocols (violet red bile glucose agar and tryptic soy agar) were 27 and 16, respectively, with sensitivity and specificity values of 100.0 and 96.9% versus 59.3 and 43.7%, respectively. These data support the fact that E. sakazakii confirmation should be based on more than one confirmation system. Both the API 20E and Biolog Microlog3 4.20 systems should be used for confirmation of E. sakazakii isolates."

Forecasting Fusarium infection and fumonisin synthesis could allow operators in the field to control contamination during the growing season and to make the best agronomic decisions for high quality yields while respecting the limits imposed by the European Union. A research project to develop a decision support system for the control of field-phase fumonisin contamination began in Italy in 2003. This paper presents a preliminary version of the engine of the decision support tool: FUMAgrain, a dynamic risk assessment model developed with data from the north of Italy. The structure of FUMAgrain is based on the pathosystem formed by maize, F. verticillioides and Ostrinia nubilalis (European Corn Borer). The elements of the pathosystem are simulated by three sub-models: (i) maize development, (ii) F. verticillioides infection and fumonisin synthesis, (iii) European Corn Borer wounding activity on maize grain. Inputs to the model are (i) planting date, (ii) hourly meteorological data including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and rain intensity, (iii) information on the phenological development of the hybrid planted (flowering and dry-down), and (iv) information about the chemical treatment against European Corn Borer. FUMAgrain gives an initial risk alert at the end of flowering based on the meteorological conditions during this phase. A second alert follows maturation when an assessment is made from (i) maize grain moisture, (ii) European Corn Borer damage to the ear, and (iii) fumonisin synthesis risk. Following calibration and validation with data FUMAgrain demonstrated its good capability to simulate fumonisin synthesis in maize grain in Italy (calibration: R^2=0.70; validation: R^2=0.71) and its usefulness for determining the optimal harvest date while respecting grain safety levels required by the international market and limiting moisture content, hence drying costs."

Currently, the significance of natural products for health and medicine has been formidable. The present study investigated the effect of grapeseed oil in male rats exposed to diazinon. The experimental rats were divided into five groups. The rats of the first group were served as control. The experimental animals of the second group were exposed to diazinon (DZN). The animals of the third group were supplemented with grapeseed oil and treated with DZN. The rats of the fourth group were supplemented with grapeseed oil. The experimental rats of the fifth group were supplemented with corn oil. Hematobiochemical and histopathological evaluations were chosen as indicators of DZN toxicity and protective role of grapeseed oil. In rats exposed only to DZN, the levels of serum glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, creatinine, urea nitrogen, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were statistically increased, while the level of serum total protein was significantly decreased. Moreover, the histopathological evaluations of the liver, kidney and testis showed that DZN causes several severe alterations. Pretreatment with grapeseed oil exhibited a protective role against DZN toxicity which confirmed by the inhibition of hematobiochemical and histopathological changes due to DZN exposure. Additionally, the present study suggests that the effect of grapeseed oil supplementation against DZN toxicity may be attributed to the antioxidant role of its constituents."

For food and environment safety, the detailed investigations on their residues and metabolism are very important. Diphenamide, napropamide and metolachlor in the pesticide products, serum, urine, soil, environmental water, fruits and wine have been widely analyzed by ELISA, fluorescence, phosphorescence, capillary electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography(GC) and GC mass spectrometry (GC-MS). However, to our knowledge, simultaneous residue analysis of diphenamide, napropamide and metolachlor in tobacco samples has not been extensively documented. Tobacco is greatly consumed by smokers throughout the world. The pesticide residue in tobaccos might be potentially harmful to smokers' health. With this in mind the residue determination and control of diphenamide, napropamide and metolachlor in the tobacco leaves are very important for tobacco products and consumers. For these three herbicides, the tolerable maximum residue limits (MRLs) have been limited ranging from 0.05 (for tobacco products) to 5 mg/kg (for tobacco leaves) in different European countries. For the complex tobacco samples, the GC and HPLC with UV detection suffer from matrix interference making quantification and identification of these herbicides difficult. In such cases the removal of the matrix effects and identification of the target compounds are of great importance.

Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were calculated for the edible portions of both lettuce and tomato. Dry weight concentrations observed in lettuce grown in a soil amended (biosolids:soil dry weight ratio of 1:10) with PFAA industrially contaminated biosolids were up to 266 and 236 ng/g for perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), respectively, and reached 56 and 211 ng/g for PFBA and PFPeA in tomato, respectively.

In addition, the BAFs for PFAAs in greenhouse lettuce decreased approximately 0.3 log units per CF2 group. A limited-scale field study was conducted to verify greenhouse findings. The greatest accumulation was seen for PFBA and PFPeA in both field-grown lettuce and tomato; BAFs for PFBA were highest in both crops. PFAA levels measured in lettuce and tomato grown in field soil amended with only a single application of biosolids (at an agronomic rate for nitrogen) were predominantly below the limit of quantitation (LOQ). In addition, corn ( Zea mays ) stover, corn grains, and soil were collected from several full-scale biosolids-amended farm fields.

Without a workable framework for conducting the ecological risk assessment (ERA) and a standardized ERA protocol, however, the utility of RNAi transgenic crops in pest management remains uncertain. The overall goal of this study is to assess the risks of RNAi-based GE crops on a non-target soil micro-arthropod, Sinella curviseta, which could be exposed to plant-protected dsRNAs deposited in crop residues. Based on the preliminary research, we hypothesized that insecticidal dsRNAs targeting at the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, a billion-dollar insect pest, has no adverse impacts on S. curviseta, a soil decomposer. Following a tiered approach, we tested this risk hypothesis using a well-designed dietary RNAi toxicity assay. To create the worst-case scenario, the full-length cDNA of v-ATPase subunit A from S. curviseta were cloned and a 400 bp fragment representing the highest sequence similarity between target pest and non-target arthropods was selected as the template to synthesize insecticidal dsRNAs. Specifically, 10-days-old S. curviseta larvae were subjected to artificial diets containing v-ATPase A dsRNAs from both D. v. virgifera (dsDVV) and S. curviseta (dsSC), respectively, a dsRNA control, Œ≤-glucuronidase, from plant (dsGUS), and a vehicle control, H2O. The endpoint measurements included gene expression profiles, survival, and life history traits, such as developmental time, fecundity, hatching rate, and body length. Although, S. curviseta larvae developed significantly faster under the treatments of dsDVV and dsSC than the vehicle control, the combined results from both temporal RNAi effect study and dietary RNAi toxicity assay support the risk hypothesis, suggesting that the impacts of ingested arthropod-active dsRNAs on this representative soil decomposer are negligible."

Principles of ecological risk assessment provide a means for assessing non-target risks when information regarding exposure to the toxin and species-specific effects are lacking. This is shown for the case of Bt Cry1F maize release in Japan, where off-field pollen dissemination and effect on butterfly species is of concern. The specific ecological entity of concern for the assessment of the non-target impact of Cry1F maize pollen was Yamato-shijimi (pale grass blue butterfly), Pseudozizeeria maha (Kollar), a commonly occurring, susceptible species. Yamato-shijimi is widely adapted in Japan where it occurs in both rural and metropolitan settings, corresponding to the distribution and habitat of katabami (Oxalis corniculata (L. )), the larval host plant. The northern extent of Yamato-shijimi habitat lies to the south of major maize production regions in Japan, but exposure may occur elsewhere where maize and Yamato-shijimi co-occur. Screening level assessment of potential adverse effects to Yamato-shijimi in the field environment considered the probability for spatial-temporal co-occurrence of the life stages of concern (1st and 2nd instars) and the stressor (Cry1F protein expressed in maize pollen) at environmentally relevant concentrations. In the event of exposure to maize pollen, early instars of Yamato-shijimi feed exclusively on the underside of katabami leaves, which further limits the portion of the butterfly population that would be exposed. Projected levels of exposure to Cry1F pollen are below the toxicity level of concern and, thus, indicate negligible risk. Most sensitive species characterization (intergenera sensitivity) similarly shows negligible risk to other Japanese butterfly species of concern when distributed beyond the maize field or field margin."

The organisms used in this study are three planktonic species: the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii, the estuarine copepod Acartia tonsa and nauplii of the marine brine shrimp Artemia franciscana. Fatty acids (FAs) are one of the most important molecules transferred across the plant-animal interface in aquatic food webs and can be used as good indicators of stress. The conducted lab incubations show that T. weissflogii is the most sensitive species to the herbicide followed by A. tonsa (EC50=0.0078mg/L and EC50=0.925mg/L, respectively), whereas the copepod was the most sensitive species to the metal followed by T. weissflogii (EC50=0.234mg/L and EC50=0.383mg/L, respectively). A. franciscana was the most tolerant organism both to the herbicide and to the metal (EC50=20.35mg/L and EC50=18.93mg/L, respectively). Changes in the FA profiles of primary producer and primary consumers were observed, with the increase of saturated FA and decrease of unsaturated FA contents, especially of highly unsaturated FAs that can be obtained mainly from food and therefore are referred to as 'essential FA'.

In two different field trials, we observed a preference in the natural infestation of corn earworm (CEW; Helicoverpa zea Boddie) to specific maize (Zea mays L. ) genotypes and investigated this observation. The field trials involved four maize lines with contrasting levels of resistance to Aspergillus flavus. The resistant lines had 7 to 14-fold greater infested ears than the susceptible lines. Seed aflatoxin B1 (AF) levels, in mock- and A. flavus-inoculated ears were consistent with genotype resistance to A. flavus, in that the resistant lines showed low levels of AF (<30 ppb), whereas the susceptible lines had up to 500 ppb. On the other hand, CEW infestation showed a positive correlation with seed fumonisins (FUM) contamination by native Fusarium verticillioides strains. We inferred that the inverse trend in the correlation of AF and FUM with H. zea infestation may be due to a differential sensitivity of CEW to the two mycotoxins. This hypothesis was tested by toxin-feeding studies. H. zea larvae showed decreasing mass with increasing AF in the diet and incurred >30% lethality at 250 ppb. In contrast, CEW was tolerant to fumonisin with no significant loss in larval mass even at 100 ppm, implicating the low seed aflatoxin content as a predominant factor for the prevalence of CEW infestation and the associated fumonisin contamination in A. flavus resistant maize lines. Further, delayed flowering of the two resistant maize lines might have contributed to the pervasive H. zea damage of these lines by providing young silk for egg-laying. These results highlight the need for integrated strategies targeting mycotoxigenic fungi as well as their insect vectors for enhanced food safety."

The objectives of this paper were to review these studies, discuss their limitations and uncertainties and identify the most critical chemicals that may pose a health risk to Brazilian consumers. The studies have shown that the cumulative intake of organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides by high consumers of fruits and vegetables may represent a health concern (up to 169% of the ARfD), although the benefits of consuming large portions of those foods most probably overcome the risks. High consumers of maize products may also be at risk due to the presence of fumonisin (355% of the PMTDI), a mycotoxin present at high levels in Brazilian maize. The studies conducted in the Brazilian Amazon have shown that riparian fish consumers are exposed to unsafe levels of mercury. However, this is a more complex issue, as mercury levels in the region are naturally high and the health benefits of a fish-based diet are well known. Studies conducted both in Brazil and internationally on acrylamide have shown that the exposure to this genotoxic compound, mainly from the consumption of French fries and potato chips, is of health concern. Reducing the population dietary exposure to toxic chemicals is a challenge for government authorities and food producers in all countries. Management strategies aimed at decreasing exposure to the critical chemicals identified in this review involve limiting the use or eliminating highly toxic pesticides, implementing good agricultural practices to decrease maize contamination by fumonisins, educating local fish-eating communities toward a fish diet less contaminated by mercury, and changing dietary habits concerning the consumption of fried potatoes, the main processed food containing acrylamide."

This study aimed to estimate impacts of climate change effects on deoxynivalenol contamination of wheat and maize grown in the Netherlands by 2040. Quantitative modelling was applied, considering both direct effects of changing climate on toxin contamination and indirect effects via shifts in crop phenology. Climate change projections for the IPCC A1B emission scenario were used for the scenario period 2031-2050 relative to the baseline period of 1975-1994. Climatic data from two different global and regional climate model combinations were used. A weather generator was applied for downscaling climate data to local conditions. Crop phenology models and prediction models for DON contamination used, each for winter wheat and grain maize. Results showed that flowering and full maturity of both wheat and maize will advance with future climate. Flowering advanced on average 5 and 11 days for wheat, and 7 and 14 days for maize (two climate model combinations). Full maturity was on average 10 and 17 days earlier for wheat, and 19 and 36 days earlier for maize. On the country level, contamination of wheat with deoxynivalenol decreased slightly, but not significantly. Variability between regions was large, and individual regions showed a significant increase in deoxynivalenol concentrations. For maize, an overall decrease in deoxynivalenol contamination was projected, which was significant for one climate model combination, but not significant for the other one. In general, results disagree with previous reported expectations of increased feed and food safety hazards under climate change. This study illustrated the relevance of using quantitative models to estimate the impacts of climate change effects on food safety, and of considering both direct and indirect effects when assessing climate change impacts on crops and related food safety hazards."

With the widespread use of pesticides in crop production, and the frequent detection of these chemicals in groundwater, large-scale risk assessments would help water resource managers to identify areas that are more susceptible to contamination and implement practices to ameliorate the problem. This paper presents an integrated, visual and interactive system for predicting potential environmental risks associated with pesticide contamination at spatial scales ranging from fields to landscapes and regions. The interactive system extends the predictive ability of the Pesticide Root Zone Model Release 2.0 (PRZM-2) to a landscape and statewide scale through integration with a geographic information system (GIS), graphical user interface and environmental databases. Predictions of statewide (Iowa) vulnerability of groundwater from atrazine leaching below the unsaturated zone were made to demonstrate the utility of the system, and the results were used in risk assessment. In the example application, atrazine fate and transport were evaluated using long-term climatic data (1980--1989) in combination with several environmental databases (eg STATSGO soils database) and exposure risks were expressed in terms of the probability of the predicted pesticide concentrations exceeding the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for drinking water. The results indicate that the predicted pesticide concentrations were significantly lower than the EPA-established MCL. In addition to providing an interactive environment for landscape-level assessment of potential risks from pesticide leaching, the system significantly reduces the time and resources needed to organize and manipulate data for use with PRZM-2, and provides an analytical framework for evaluating groundwater-leaching impacts of pesticide management practices."

The PFCs included perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA), and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA). The CMs with different concentrations (0-1.5% dry weight) were amended into sediments spiked with PFCs and aged for 60 d. The uptake rate constants (k(s)) for each PFC to larvae differed with different CM amendments (p < 0.05), while elimination rate did not change significantly (p > 0.05). Decreasing PFC concentration in larvae (C(B)) was found with increasing CM concentration (f(CM)) in the sediments, and a linear positive correlation existed between 1/C(B) and f(CM) (p < 0.05). The effect of CMs on PFC bioaccumulation agreed well with the CM properties; MWCNT10 with the highest specific surface area resulted in the lowest k(s) values and biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAF), with a BSAF reduction of 66%-97% by a 1.5% amendment. The mechanism was explored by analyzing the aqueous phase concentrations of PFCs and the sorption of PFCs on sediments amended with CMs. The results suggested that the decreasing trend of PFCs in larvae was caused by the decreasing aqueous phase concentration with increasing CM concentration. In the studied conditions with low PFC concentrations, the bioaccumulation of PFCs was a linear partitioning between pore water and biota, and the sorption of PFCs to the sediment/CM mixtures was a two domain linear distribution. This study suggests that both the type and concentration of carbonaceous materials in sediment can affect the bioaccumulation of PFCs to benthic organisms through changing their aqueous phase concentrations."

The role of PAs in plant disease resistance depends on the relative abundance of higher PAs [spermidine (Spd), spermine (Spm)] vs. the diamine putrescine (Put) and PA catabolism. With respect to the pathogen, PAs are required to achieve successful pathogenesis of the host. Maize is an important food and feed crop, which is highly susceptible to Aspergillus flavus infection. Upon infection, the fungus produces carcinogenic aflatoxins and numerous other toxic secondary metabolites that adversely affect human health and crop value worldwide. To evaluate the role of PAs in aflatoxin resistance in maize, in vitro kernel infection assays were performed using maize lines that are susceptible (SC212) or resistant (TZAR102, MI82) to aflatoxin production. Results indicated significant induction of both PA biosynthetic and catabolic genes upon A. flavus infection. As compared to the susceptible line, the resistant maize lines showed higher basal expression of PA metabolism genes in mock-inoculated kernels that increased upon fungal infection. In general, increased biosynthesis and conversion of Put to Spd and Spm along with their increased catabolism was evident in the resistant lines vs. the susceptible line SC212. There were higher concentrations of amino acids such as glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln) and Œ≥-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in SC212. The resistant lines were significantly lower in fungal load and aflatoxin production as compared to the susceptible line.

This study was therefore initiated to assess the level of aflatoxin contamination of various foodstuffs sold in urban and semi-urban markets in Burkina Faso, and to evaluate the carcinogenic risk which the consuming population is exposed to. Two hundred and twelve foodstuff samples were collected in two large cities (Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso) and three semi urban localities (Cinkans√©, Dakola and Niangoloko). Aflatoxins contents in foodstuffs were determined by immunoaffinity chromatography and human health risk assessment was performed by using the Monte Carlo algorithm. The aflatoxins contents determination showed that 41.50% of studied samples were contaminated with concentrations up to 182.28¬†Œºg/kg for AFB1 in peanuts. Chronic Daily Intake, calculated based on the consumption patterns assumed in this study, was estimated to be higher in large cities (CDI¬†=¬†33.68¬†Œºg/kg bw in Ouagadougou and 10.18¬†Œºg/kg bw in Bobo Dioulasso) than in semi urban localities (CDI¬†=¬†4.29¬†Œºg/kg bw in Cinkans√©, CDI¬†=¬†0.39¬†Œºg/kg bw in Dakola and CDI¬†=¬†0.18¬†Œºg/kg bw in Niangoloko).

In semi urban localities, no carcinogenic risk was observed to public health.

Maize and three small grain cereals (sorghum, pearl millet, and finger millet) produced by smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe during 2016 and 2017 were examined for fungal community structure, and total aflatoxin (AF) and fumonisin (FM) content. A total of 800 maize and 180 small grain samples were collected at harvest and during storage from four agroecological zones. Fusarium spp. dominated the fungi associated with maize. Across crops, Aspergillusflavus constituted the main Aspergillus spp. Small grain cereals were less susceptible to both AF and FM. AF (52%) and FM (89%) prevalence was higher in maize than in small grains (13-25% for AF and 0-32% for FM). Less than 2% of small grain samples exceeded the EU regulatory limit for AF (4 ¬µg/kg), while <10% exceeded the EU regulatory limit for FM (1000 ¬µg/kg). For maize, 28% and 54% of samples exceeded AF and FM Codex guidance limits, respectively. Higher AF contamination occurred in the drier and hotter areas while more FM occurred in the wetter year. AF exposure risk assessment revealed that small grain consumption posed low health risks (‚â§0.02 liver cancer cases/100,000 persons/year) while maize consumption potentially caused higher liver cancer rates of up to 9.2 cases/100,000 persons/year depending on the locality. Additionally, FM hazard quotients from maize consumption among children and adults were high in both years, but more so in a wet year than a dry year. Adoption of AF and FM management practices throughout the maize value chain coupled with policies supporting dietary diversification are needed to protect maize consumers in Zimbabwe from AF- and FM-associated health effects. The higher risk of health burden from diseases associated with elevated concentration of mycotoxins in preferred maize during climate change events can be relieved by increased consumption of small grains."

Mycotoxins also induce mutagenic and carcinogenic effects after long exposure. Among mycotoxins that contaminate food are aflatoxins (AF) such as AFB1, which is the most powerful natural carcinogen. The AF poisoning results in symptoms of depression, anorexia, diarrhea, jaundice or anemia that can lead to death, but very few studies have explored the impact of AF on neuroendocrine regulations. To better understand the neurotoxic effects of AF related to anorexia, we explored in rat the impact of AFB1 on the major hypothalamic neuropeptides regulating feeding behavior, either orexigenic (NPY, Orexin, AgRP, MCH) or anorexigenic (Œ±-MSH, CART, TRH). We also studied the effect of AFB1 on a novel neuropeptide, the secretogranin II (SgII)-derived peptide EM66, which has recently been linked to the control of food intake. For this, adult male rats were orally treated twice a week for 5 weeks with a low dose (150 Œºg/kg) or a high dose (300 Œºg/kg) of AFB1 dissolved in corn oil. Repeated exposure to AFB1 resulted in reduced body weight gain, which was highly significant for the high dose of AF. Immunocytochemical and quantitative PCR experiments revealed a dose-related decrease in the expression of all the hypothalamic neuropeptides studied in response to AFB1. Such orexigenic and anorexigenic alterations may underlie appetite disorders as they are correlated to a dose-dependent decrease in body weight gain of treated rats as compared to controls. We also found a decrease in the number of EM66-containing neurons in the arcuate nucleus of AFB1-treated animals, which was associated with a lower expression of its precursor SgII. These findings show for the first time that repeated consumption of AFB1 disrupts the hypothalamic regulation of neuropeptides involved in feeding behavior, which may contribute to the lower body weight gain associated to AF exposure."

Agricultural and reclamation activities impose fresh inputs of organic matter on soil while intensive irrigation and rainstorm increase soil waterlogging incidence. Moreover, scarcity of irrigation water has prompted the use of greywater, which contain variable concentrations of organic compounds such as anionic surfactants. Soils added with hay, maize straw or peat at 1% w/w were irrigated, at field capacity (FC) or saturated (S), with an aqueous solution of the anionic surfactant Aerosol 22 (A22), corresponding to an addition of 200 mgC/kgsoil/day. Soil solution was extracted after one month and analysed for total soluble metals, dissolved soil organic matter and UV absorbance at 254 nm. Speciation analyses were performed with WHAM VI for Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn. For selected scenarios, metal uptake by barley was determined. Metal mobility increased for all treatments and soils (Pb>Cu>Cd‚â•Zn) compared to control assays. The increase was significantly correlated (p<0.05) with soil organic matter solubilisation for Cd (R=0.68), Cu (R=0.73) and Zn (R=0.86). Otherwise, Pb release was related to aluminium solubilisation (R=0.75), which suggests that Pb was originally co-precipitated with Al-DOC complexes in the solid phase. The effect of A22 in metal bioavailability, determined as free ion activities (FIA), was mainly controlled by soil moisture regime. For soil 3, metal bioavailability was up to 20 times lower for soil amended with hay, peat or maize compared to soil treated only with A22. When soil was treated with A22 at FC barley yield significantly decreased (p<0.05) for the increase of Pb (R=0.71) and Zn (R=0.79) concentrations in shoot, while for saturated conditions such uptake was up to 3 times lower.

Model outputs for atrazine, bromoxynil, glyphosate, metolachlor, pendimethalin, sethoxydim, triflualin, and 2,4-D model output were used to predict the possible long-term implications that large-scale bioenergy crop expansion may have on the bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and humans. Threshold toxicity levels were obtained for the bluegill and for human consumption for all pesticides being evaluated through an extensive literature review. Model output was compared to each toxicity level for the suggested exposure time (96-hour for bluegill and 24-hour for humans). The results suggest that traditional intensive row crops such as canola, corn and sorghum may negatively impact aquatic life, and in most cases affect the safe drinking water availability. The continuous corn rotation, the most representative rotation for current agricultural practices for a starch-based ethanol economy, delivers the highest concentrations of glyphosate to the stream. In addition, continuous canola contributed to a concentration of 1.11 ppm of trifluralin, a highly toxic herbicide, which is 8.7 times the 96-hour ecotoxicity of bluegills and 21 times the safe drinking water level.

In this study the Ames test with soil elutriates, and emergence and growth assays with Lactuca sativa L. and Zea mays L. were performed to assess soil retention and habitat functions. Levels of metals bioaccumulated in plant tissues, grown above soil surface, during the assays, were determined as well. No genotoxic effects were recorded for soil eluates (1:10 and 1:2, m/v) except for site F within the mine area, which is under the effluence of runoffs from the effluent treatment pond. Nevertheless, most of all were highly toxic to Salmonella typhimurium (especially for TA98) strains, used in the assay. The results gathered suggested that during the natural process of soil percolation by rainwater, the leachates yielded are contributing with toxic but no genotoxic metals to underground water resources. Phytotoxicity assays demonstrated that soil habitat function was compromised in almost all the sampling sites selected within the mine area. These results have clearly demonstrated how evaluations based on extractable metal concentrations may underestimate the risks of contaminated soils. Lettuce was the most sensitive species probably due to the great ability of this species in accumulating high concentrations of metals in their aboveground tissues.

Previous studies indicate that resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1A and Cry1F toxins was genetically linked with mutations of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter subfamily C gene ABCC2 in at least seven lepidopteran insects. Several strains selected in the laboratory of the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis, a destructive pest of corn in Asian Western Pacific countries, developed high levels of resistance to Cry1A and Cry1F toxins. The causality between the O. furnacalisABCC2 (OfABCC2) gene and resistance to Cry1A and Cry1F toxins remains unknown. Here, we successfully generated a homozygous strain (OfC2-KO) of O. furnacalis with an 8-bp deletion mutation of ABCC2 by the CRISPR/Cas9 approach. The 8-bp deletion mutation results in a frame shift in the open reading frame of transcripts, which produced a predicted protein truncated in the TM4-TM5 loop region. The knockout strain OfC2-KO showed much more than a 300-fold resistance to Cry1Fa, and low levels of resistance to Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac (<10-fold), but no significant effects on the toxicities of Cry1Aa and two chemical insecticides (abamectin and chlorantraniliprole), compared to the background NJ-S strain. Furthermore, we found that the Cry1Fa resistance was autosomal, recessive, and significantly linked with the 8-bp deletion mutation of OfABCC2 in the OfC2-KO strain. In conclusion, in vivo functional investigation demonstrates the causality of the OfABCC2 truncating mutation with high-level resistance to the Cry1Fa toxin in O. furnacalis.

To assist in risk assessment, the present study proposes a prioritization procedure of stream types based on the freshwater network and crop-specific cultivation data using maize in Germany as a model system. To identify stream types with a high probability of receiving crop materials, we developed a formalized, criteria-based and thus transparent procedure that considers the exposure-related parameters, ecological status--an estimate of the diversity and potential vulnerability of local communities towards anthropogenic stress--and availability of uncontaminated reference sections. By applying the procedure to maize, ten stream types out of 38 are expected to be the most relevant if the ecological effects from plant-incorporated pesticides need to be evaluated. This information is an important first step to identifying habitats within these stream types with a high probability of receiving crop plant material at a more local scale, including accumulation areas. Moreover, the prioritization procedure developed in the present study may support the selection of aquatic species for ecotoxicological testing based on their probability of occurrence in stream types having a higher chance of exposure. Finally, this procedure can be adapted to any geographical region or crop of interest and is, therefore, a valuable tool for a site-specific risk assessment of crop plants carrying systemic pesticides or novel proteins, such as insecticidal Bt toxins, expressed in genetically modified crops."

Our results showed that, at higher concentrations, both ME and TE extracts that contained varying amounts of aflatoxin caused a considerable decrease in Vero cell viability (up to 37%) after 4 h of exposure. Aflatoxins from ME induced greater oxidative damage by enhancing lipid peroxidation (up to 6.05 ¬± 0.14 Œºmol/mg protein) as compared to TE; however, TE also induced significant malondialdehyde formation in particular at the higher aflatoxin concentration tested (up to 2.7 ¬± 0.19 Œºmol/mg protein). The decrease in GSH level was also more pronounced in ME as compared to TE. Moreover, the Ames test results indicated that the mutagenic activity of TE was greatly reduced compared with that of ME based on his(-) ‚Üí his(+) reversions in the Salmonella TA100 strain. According to these results, it is concluded that the microwave nixtamalization procedure reduced aflatoxins and their in vitro toxicity and mutagenic activity. In Mexico, aflatoxins are often found in maize destined for the tortilla industry; consequently, tortilla consumption invariably leads to an important intake of intact and/or modified aflatoxin molecules caused by the thermal-alkaline treatment used during production. Therefore, it is of the highest importance to check whether such intake has the potential to lead to higher risk for adverse human health effects.

The toxicity of purified Cry3Bb1 for the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was determined using a bioassay and gene expression analysis. In addition, a soil toxicity test was used to assess the effects on C. elegans of rhizosphere soil obtained from plots of an experimental field grown with Mon88017, the near-isogenic cultivar, or either of two conventional cultivars. Finally, the indigenous nematode communities from the experimental field site with Mon88017 and from the control cultivars were analyzed.

Moreover, Cry-protein-specific defense genes were found to be up-regulated in the presence of either Cry1Ab or Cry3Bb1. However, C. elegans was not affected by rhizosphere soils from Mon88017 compared to the control plots, due to the very low Cry3Bb1 concentrations, as indicated by quantitative analyses (< 1 ng g‚Åª¬π soil). Nematode abundance and diversity were essentially the same between the various maize cultivars. At the last sampling date, nematode genus composition in Bt-maize plots differed significantly from that in two of the three non-Bt cultivars, including the near-isogenic maize, but the shift in genus composition did not influence the composition of functional guilds within the nematode communities.

In this study, we explored the effects of three different food sources; corn litter (agriculture grain residuals), Mongolian oak litter (natural plant residuals), and yeast (common food for Collembola culture), on the microbiota of a winter-active Collembola species, Desoria ruseki. We found that microbial diversity and community composition of the Collembola were strongly altered after feeding with different food sources for 30 days.

Our study indicates that food sources are major determinants for Collembola microbiota that simultaneously alter consumers' isotopic niches, thereby improving our understanding of the roles played by host-microbiota interactions in sustaining soil biodiversity during the winter."

Most previous works have only dealt with the visual symptoms, but not with the toxins of GER. As food and feed safety rankings depend on toxin contamination, including deoxynivalenol (DON), without toxins, nothing can be said about the risks involved in food and feed quality. Therefore, three susceptible, three medium-susceptible, and three medium-resistant mother lines were crossed with three testers with differing degrees of resistance and tested between 2017-2020. Two plot replicates and two fungal strains were used separately. The highest heterosis was found at the GER% with a 13% increase across 27 hybrids, including 7 hybrids showing negative heterosis (a higher hybrid performance above the parental mean), with a variance ranging between 63.5 and -55.4. For DON, the mean heterosis was negative at -35%, and only 10 of the 27 hybrids showed a positive heterosis. The mean heterosis for DON contamination, at 1% GER, was again negative (-19.6%, varying between 85% and 224%). Only 17 hybrids showed heterosis, while that of the other 17 was rated higher than the parental mean. A positive significant correlation was found only for GER% and DON; the other factors were not significant. Seven hybrids were identified with positive (2) or negative (5) heterosis for all traits, while the rest varied. For DON and GER, only 13 provided identical (positive or negative) heteroses. The majority of the hybrids appeared to diverge in the regulation of the three traits. The stability of GER and DON (variance across eight data sets) did not agree-only half of the genotypes responded similarly for the two traits. The genetic background for this trait is unknown, and there was no general agreement between traits. Thus, without toxin analyses, the evaluation of food safety is not possible. The variety in degrees of resistance to toxigenic fungi and resistance to toxin accumulation is an inevitable factor."

Leaching loss of fertilizer N represents a cost for farmers and has consequences for human health and the environment, especially in the southern Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA, where groundwater nitrate contamination is prevalent. While improved nutrient management and conservation practices have been implemented to minimize leaching, nitrate levels in groundwater continue to increase in many long-term monitoring wells. To elucidate controls on leaching rates and N dynamics in agricultural soils across soil depths, and in response to seasonal and annual variation in management (e. g. , fertilizer input amount and summer irrigation), we intensively monitored the transport of water and nitrate every two weeks for four years through the vadose zone at three depths (0.8, 1.5, and 3.0 m) in a sweet corn (maize) field. Though nitrate leaching was highly variable among lysimeters at the same depth and across years, a strong pattern emerged: annual nitrate leaching significantly decreased with depth across the study, averaging ~104 kg N ha-1 yr-1 near the surface (0.8 m) versus ~56 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in the deep soil (3.0 m), a 54% reduction in leaching between the soil layers. Even though crops were irrigated in summer, most leaching (~72% below 3.0 m) occurred during the wet fall and winter. Based on steady state assumptions, a net equivalent of ~29% of surface N inputs leached below 3.0 m into the deeper soil and groundwater, while ~44% was removed in crop harvest, indicating considerable N retention in the soil (~27% of inputs or approximately 58 kg N ha-1 yr-1). The accumulation and long-term dynamics of deep soil N is a legacy of agricultural management that should be further studied to better manage and reduce nitrate loss to groundwater."

In the present study, 83 A. flavus isolates from two maize regions of Argentina were characterized and evaluated for their ability to produce or lack of producing mycotoxins in order to select atoxigenic strains to be used as potential biocontrol agents (BCA). All of the isolates were tested for aflatoxin and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) production in maize kernels and a liquid culture medium. Genetic diversity of the nonaflatoxigenic isolates was evaluated by analysis of vegetative compatibility groups (VCG) and confirmation of deletions in the aflatoxin biosynthesis cluster. Eight atoxigenic isolates were compared for their ability to reduce aflatoxin and CPA contamination in maize kernels in coinoculation tests. The A. flavus population was composed of 32% aflatoxin and CPA producers and 52% CPA producers, and 16% was determined as atoxigenic. All of the aflatoxin producer isolates also produced CPA. Aflatoxin and CPA production was significantly higher in maize kernels than in liquid medium. The 57 nonaflatoxigenic strains formed six VCG, with AM1 and AM5 being the dominant groups, with a frequency of 58 and 35%, respectively. In coinoculation experiments, all of the atoxigenic strains reduced aflatoxin from 54 to 83% and CPA from 60 to 97%. Members of group AM1 showed a greater aflatoxin reduction than members of AM5 (72 versus 66%) but no differences were detected in CPA production. Here, we described for the first time atoxigenic isolates of A. flavus that show promise to be used as BCA in maize crops in Argentina.

This paper systematically studied the distribution and transport of PFAAs in agricultural soil, irrigation water and precipitation, followed by crop bioaccumulation and finally human exposure of PFAAs within a 10km radius around a mega-fluorochemical industrial park (FIP). Hotspots of contamination by PFAAs were found near the FIP and downstream of the effluent discharge point with the maximum concentrations of 641ng/g in agricultural soil, 480ng/g in wheat grain, 58.8ng/g in maize grain and 4,862ng/L in precipitation. As the distance increased from the FIP, PFAAs concentrations in all media showed a sharp initial decrease followed by a moderate decline. Elevated PFAA concentrations in soil and grains were still present within a radius of 10 km of the FIP. The soil contamination was associated with the presence of PFAAs in irrigation water and precipitation, and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the dominant PFAA component in soil. However, due to bioaccumulation preference, short-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), especially perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), became the major PFAA contaminants in grains of wheat and maize. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for both grains showed a decrease with increasing chain length of PFAAs (approximately 0.5 log decrease per CF2 group). Compared to maize grain, wheat grain showed higher BAFs, possibly related to its higher protein content. The PFCA (C4-C8) concentrations (on a log10 basis) in agricultural soil and grain were found to show a linear positive correlation. Local human exposure of PFOA via the consumption of contaminated grains represents a health risk for local residents, especially for toddlers and children."

This study focused on investigating AFB1 contamination in maize and groundnut from respondent households, exposure among women of reproductive age and associations of aflatoxin contamination with growth retardation among children in Mtwara region, Tanzania. The highest maximum AFB1 contamination levels from all samples obtained were in maize grain (2351.5 Œºg/kg). From a total of 217 maize samples collected, aflatoxins were above European Union (EU) and East African Community (EAC) tolerable limits in 76.0% and 64.5% of all samples. Specifically, maize grain had the highest proportion of samples contaminated above tolerable limits (80.3% and 71.1% for EU and EAC limits). Groundnut had 54.0% and 37.9% of samples above EU and EAC maximum tolerable limits. The lowest proportion of contaminated samples on the other hand was for bambara nut (37.5% and 29.2% for EU and EAC limits, respectively). Aflatoxin exposure in our surveyed population was much higher than previous observations made in Tanzania and also higher than those observed in Western countries such as Australia and the USA. Among children, AFB1 concentration was associated with lower weight for height z scores and weight for age z scores in the univariate model (p < 0.05). In summary, these results indicate the seriousness of aflatoxin contamination in foods commonly consumed in the vulnerable population assessed. Strategies both from the health, trade, and nutrition sectors should therefore be designed and implemented to address aflatoxin and mycotoxin contamination in diets."

The major metabolites of the oxidative demethylation of MTBE in vivo were methanol and tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA), whereas formaldehyde and TBA were the principal products of hepatic microsomal oxidation by cytochrome P-450. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats treated with intragastric MTBE in corn oil gave an initial disposition T1/2 for MTBE of 0.32 h. The decline in the serum drug versus time curve for MTBE in rats was accompanied by a progressive increase in serum methanol concentrations to levels more than 50-200 times those of the parent compound. Repeated exposure of MTBE vapor by inhalation in rats resulted in dose-dependent increases in MTBE in the blood, brain, and adipose tissue compartments. Blood concentrations of TBA were also dose dependent and provided an estimate of the total amount of MTBE distributed to peripheral drug metabolizing compartments. Perirenal fat/blood MTBE concentration ratios ranged from 9.7 to 11.6 after 15 wk of intermittent exposure. During an oxyfuels program in Fairbanks, AK, blood levels of occupationally exposed workers were 0.2-31.5 microgram/L MTBE and 1.6 to 72.2 microgram/L TBA with a mean TBA:MTBE blood concentration ratio of 4.2. In patients who received MTBE by percutaneous, transhepatic puncture for the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones, concentrations of MTBE in fat tissue reached 60 and 300 microgram/g at a treatment time when mean blood MTBE was less than 20 microgram/ml. The results of laboratory and clinical studies indicate that metabolites of MTBE may contribute to the nephropathy, neoplasms, and other pathological changes associated with repeated exposure to MTBE in experimental animals.

In each instance, estradiol found in the conditioned yeast culture medium originated from an exogenous source and was not synthesized by the yeast. In the first instance, yeast grown in the laboratory showed a time-dependent increase in estradiol in the conditioned medium. However, the culture medium supplement Bacto-peptone was found to contain large amounts of estrone. When added to yeast cultures in the form of YPD medium (yeast extract, Bacto-peptone, and dextrose), S. cerevisiae converted the estrone to estradiol leading to the accumulation of estradiol over time. In the second instance, commercially purchased S. cerevisiae grown in a molasses medium exhibited substantial amounts of estradiol. However, corn and beet molasses contained sufficient estrone and estradiol to account for the findings. As in the first instance, the yeast converted the estrone into estradiol. In the third instance, autoclaving culture medium in polycarbonate plastic flasks was found to cause an estrogenic substance to be added to the medium, whether yeast were present or not. It was determined that the autoclaving process leached bisphenol-A (BPA) out of the polycarbonate plastic. BPA was shown to bind to estrogen receptors and to induce estrogenic activity, including stimulation of MCF-7 breast cancer-cell proliferation and induction of the expression of progesterone receptors. The three instances highlight potential problems for investigators who might inadvertently add estrogens to experimental systems confounding their results. The BPA findings raise concerns about the possible addition of this estrogenic molecule to the food supply since polycarbonate plastic is used in myriad applications in the packaging of food and beverages.

Natural infection from Fusarium spp. was higher than 1.5%, and for Aspergillus spp. this was normally 0.01% or 0, much lower than would be considered as severe infection. In spite of this, many hybrids provided far higher toxin contamination than regulations allow. The maximum preharvest aflatoxin B1 was in 2020 (at 2286 Œºg/kg), and, in several cases, the value was higher than 1000 Œºg/kg. The hybrid differences were large. In Hungary, the presence of field-originated aflatoxin B1 was continuous, with three AFB1 epidemics in the 8 years. The highest DON contamination was in 2014 (at 27 mg/kg), and a detectable DON level was found in every hybrid. FUMB1+B2 were the highest in 2014 (at 45.78 mg/kg). At these low infection levels, correlations between visual symptoms and toxin contaminations were mostly non-significant, so it is not feasible to draw a conclusion about toxin contamination from ear rot coverage alone. The toxin contamination of hybrids for a percentage of visual infection is highly variable, and only toxin data can decide about food safety. Hybrids with no visual symptoms and high AFB1 contamination were also identified. Preharvest control, including breeding and variety registration, is therefore of the utmost importance to all three pathogens. Even natural ear rot and toxin data do not prove differences in resistance, so a high ear rot or toxin contamination level should be considered as a risk factor for hybrids. The toxin control of freshly harvested grain is vital for separating healthy and contaminated lots. In addition, proper growing and storage conditions must be ensured to protect the feed safety of the grain."

The emission factors (EFs) of anhydrosugars and some fatty acids showed slight variations between fresh and aged samples, indicating that these compounds are relatively stable. However, the EFs of n-alkanes, fatty alcohols, and parent-PAHs decreased 8-57% from fresh to aged samples, suggesting that they can undergo further oxidation to form other organic materials in the atmosphere. Phthalic acids, nitrophenols and isoprene-derived products were mainly secondarily formed by aging processes. Thus their EFs increased by 2-23 times from fresh to aged samples. Levoglucosan was the most abundant individual organic tracer, and its EF varied slightly between fresh and aged samples, proving its indicative role on BB emission. Moreover, the ratio of vanillic acid to levoglucosan and p-hydroxybenzoic acid to levoglucosan increased 2-13 times from fresh to aged samples.

Methane emission was measured continuously using the GreenFeed system. Methaemoglobin was determined every week in peripheral blood from bulls receiving the LN diet. Nitrate and nitrite concentrations were determined in rumen, liver and tongue sampled at slaughter. Dry matter intake tended to be lower for LN diet (P=0.10). Body weight gain was lower for LN diet (P=0.01; 1.60 and 1.26 kg/day for C and LN diet, respectively).

The asparagine synthetase gene families of the Triticeae species each comprise five genes per genome, with the genes assigned to four groups: 1, 2, 3 (subdivided into 3.1 and 3.2) and 4. Each species has a single gene per genome in each group, except that some bread wheat varieties (genomes AABBDD) and emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides; genomes AABB) lack a group 2 gene in the B genome. This raises questions about the ancestry of cultivated pasta wheat and the B genome donor of bread wheat, suggesting that the hybridisation event that gave rise to hexaploid bread wheat occurred more than once. In phylogenetic analyses, genes from the other species cluster with the Triticeae genes, but brachypodium, sorghum and maize lack a group 2 gene, while rice has only two genes, one group 3 and one group 4. This means that TaASN2, the most highly expressed asparagine synthetase gene in wheat grain, has no equivalent in maize, rice, sorghum or brachypodium. An evolutionary pathway is proposed in which a series of gene duplications gave rise to the five genes found in modern Triticeae species."

Sampling campaigns were conducted to collect WWTP effluent, surface and irrigation water, river sediments, agricultural soils and maize fruits. Results demonstrate the ubiquitous presence of several pharmaceuticals. The concentration pattern in irrigation water did not resemble the pattern of contents in soils and plants. The pharmaceuticals included in the EU surface water watch lists were quantified in the lowest concentration range (macrolide antibiotics, ciprofloxacin) or were not detected (most of the hormones). Therefore, hormones do not represent an emerging risk in our scenario. The TMs and the metalloid in water and agricultural soils should not arise any concern. Whereas, their presence in the river sediments may have an adverse impact on aquatic ecosystems. Only acetaminophen, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, nicotine, Zn, Cu and Ni were quantified in corn grains.

Thus multiple chemical contaminants threaten the safety of many food commodities; hence the present study used maize as a model crop to identify the severity in terms of human exposure when multiple contaminants are present. High Content Analysis (HCA) measuring multiple endpoints was used to determine cytotoxicity of complex mixtures of mycotoxins, heavy metals and pesticides. Endpoints included nuclear intensity (NI), nuclear area (NA), plasma membrane permeability (PMP), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial mass (MM). At concentrations representing legal limits of each individual contaminant in maize (3ng/ml ochratoxin A (OTA), 1Œºg/ml fumonisin B1 (FB1), 2ng/ml aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), 100ng/ml cadmium (Cd), 150ng/ml arsenic (As), 50ng/ml chlorpyrifos (CP) and 5Œºg/ml pirimiphos methyl (PM), the mixtures (tertiary mycotoxins plus Cd/As) and (tertiary mycotoxins plus Cd/As/CP/PM) were cytotoxic for NA and MM endpoints with a difference of up to 13.6% (p‚â§0.0001) and 12% (p‚â§0.0001) respectively from control values. The most cytotoxic mixture was (tertiary mycotoxins plus Cd/As/CP/PM) across all 4 endpoints (NA, NI, MM and MMP) with increases up to 61.3%, 23.0%, 61.4% and 36.3% (p‚â§0.0001) respectively. Synergy was evident for two endpoints (NI and MM) at concentrations contaminating maize above legal limits, with differences between expected and measured values of (6.2-12.4% (p‚â§0.05-p‚â§0.001) and 4.5-12.3% (p‚â§0.05-p‚â§0.001) for NI and MM, respectively. The study introduces for the first time, a holistic approach to identify the impact in terms of toxicity to humans when multiple chemical contaminants are present in foodstuffs.

The protein expression levels of Src/p-Src, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2 and CREB/p-CREB were detected by Western bolt. The results showed that the body weight gain, testes weight, testis coefficient, sperm density, sperm activity, sperm survival rate and protein expression levels of p-ERK1, p-ERK2 and p-CREB decreased, but the sperm abnormality rate increased with increasing BPA concentrations. There were positive correlations between sperm density, sperm activity and sperm survival rate with protein expression levels of p-ERK1, p-ERK2 and p-CREB, and negative correlations between sperm abnormality rate with the protein expression levels of p-ERK1, p-ERK2 and p-CREB. Results from the structural equation model demonstrated that BPA retained a significant negative effect to p-ERK, whereas p-ERK retained a significant positive effect to sperm quality and acted as the mediate variable. This study provides a novel insight regarding the potential role of p-ERK1 and p-ERK2 protein kinase on reproductive toxicity of BPA. The adverse effects of BPA on adult male sperm quality may be through the induction of the disruption of ERK signal pathway.

Molecular profiling techniques can be considered useful tools to address emerging biosafety gaps. Here we report the first results of a proteomic profiling coupled to transgene transcript expression analysis of a stacked commercial maize hybrid containing insecticidal and herbicide tolerant traits in comparison to the single event hybrids in the same genetic background. Our results show that stacked genetically modified (GM) genotypes were clustered together and distant from other genotypes analyzed by PCA. Twenty-two proteins were shown to be differentially modulated in stacked and single GM events versus non-GM isogenic maize and a landrace variety with Brazilian genetic background. Enrichment analysis of these proteins provided insight into two major metabolic pathway alterations: energy/carbohydrate and detoxification metabolism. Furthermore, stacked transgene transcript levels had a significant reduction of about 34% when compared to single event hybrid varieties. Stacking two transgenic inserts into the genome of one GM maize hybrid variety may impact the overall expression of endogenous genes. Observed protein changes differ significantly from those of single event lines and a conventional counterpart. Some of the protein modulation did not fall within the range of the natural variability for the landrace used in this study. Higher expression levels of proteins related to the energy/carbohydrate metabolism suggest that the energetic homeostasis in stacked versus single event hybrid varieties also differ. Upcoming global databases on outputs from ""omics"" analyses could provide a highly desirable benchmark for the safety assessment of stacked transgenic crop events. Accordingly, further studies should be conducted in order to address the biological relevance and implications of such changes."

There is a lack of studies evaluating how safe the consumption of food cultivated in soils containing urban sewage sludge is. Thus, the aim of this paper was to evaluate biochemical and redox parameters in rats fed with corn produced in a soil treated with urban sewage sludge for a long term. For these experiments, maize plants were grown in soil amended with sewage sludge (rates of 5, 10 and 20 t/ha) or not (control). Four different diets were prepared with the corn grains produced in the field experiment, and rats were fed with these diets for 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Biochemical parameters (glucose, total cholesterol and fractions, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) as well the redox state biomarkers such as reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase, glutathione peroxidase and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) were assessed. Our results show no differences in the biomarkers over 1 or 2 weeks. However, at 4 weeks BuChE activity was inhibited in rats fed with corn grown in soil amended with sewage sludge (5, 10 and 20 t/ha), while MDA levels increased. Furthermore, prolonged exposure to corn cultivated in the highest amount per hectare of sewage sludge (8 and 12 weeks) was associated with an increase in MDA levels and a decrease in GSH levels, respectively. Our findings add new evidence of the risks of consuming food grown with urban sewage sludge.

The analytical method employed extraction of the wipe samples into dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) flourometric detection of pyrene, a predominant PAH in used gasoline engine oils (UGEO). Recovery of pyrene was evaluated for two different sampling media by first contaminating the hands of a small number of volunteers with UGEO, followed by applying a small amount of corn oil to the palms, and by wiping the skin with a Whatman cellulostic filter paper or a polyester fabric wipe (i. e. , Alpha wipes). In summary, using either Whatman or Alpha wipes, the mean recovery of pyrene from the UGEO that was applied to the hands and contained within three consecutive wipes was 69% and 54%, respectively. However, the relative recovery of the first to second wipe was on average 47% and 75% for the two media, respectively. These results indicate that the Alpha wipes were more efficient at recovering pyrene in the first wipe but less efficient overall when all three consecutive samples were included. Even though this sampling was performed in a controlled laboratory environment, the minimum and maximum amount of pyrene recovered in the individual composite samples using either method spanned a range of twofold. Overall, intra-and interpersonal variability, as measured by coefficient of variation, were 22% and 19%, respectively, and were not statistically different by type of media used. This method was used in a pilot field survey to sample the hands of 18 automotive repair technicians and 18 office workers.

In this paper, aflatoxin contamination in freshly harvested and stored crop produce from central Tanzania was examined, including the efficacy of aflatoxin mitigation technologies on grain/kernal quality.

AFB1 was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The average aflatoxin contamination in freshly harvested samples was 18.8¬†Œºg/kg, which is above the acceptable standard of 10¬†Œºg/kg.

Furthermore, the effects of these factors were quantified by multivariate statistical analyses. Training and behavioral changes by farmers in their post-harvest practice minimize aflatoxin contamination and improve food safety.

In October 1999, April 2000, and October 2000, meso- and macrofauna and maize and rye litter were collected in each plot and analyzed for 13C and 15N content. 15N signatures suggested that the soil animal species analyzed span three trophic levels with the trophic position of species varying little in time. The species investigated formed a continuum from primary to secondary decomposers to predators. On average, predator species differed from primary and secondary decomposers by 3.9 sigma15N suggesting that they fed on a mixed diet of both decomposer groups. The combined analysis of 13C and 15N signatures allowed us to identify links between prey and consumer species. In October 1999, shortly after maize residues had been incorporated into the plots, maize-born carbon was present in each of the animal species investigated, including top predators. The incorporation of maize carbon into the belowground food web increased during the following 12 months but the concentration of maize-born carbon never exceeded 50% in any of the species. Furthermore, the ranks of the incorporation of maize-born carbon of the species changed little. The results suggest that the belowground food web relies heavily on carbon originating from plant residues from before the recent two growing seasons. In most species the amount of maize-born carbon increased continuously; however, in some species it decreased during winter, suggesting that these species switched to a diet based more on C3 plants during winter, or predominantly metabolized carbon incorporated during the last growing season.

Seventy-nine of the samples were of ground waters and 19 were of surface waters. The concentration ranges of the herbicides detected in the study period (October 1997-October 1998) were 0.04-25.3 microg L(-1) in the surface waters and 0.04-3.45 microg L(-1) in the ground waters for atrazine, and 0.06-31.9 microg L(-1) in the surface waters and 0.05-4.85 microg L(-1) in the ground waters in the case of alachlor. The highly significant correlation observed between the concentrations of both herbicides in the surface waters (r = 0.89, p < 0.001) pointed to a parallel transport of atrazine and alachlor to these waters. A study was made of the temporal evolution of the concentrations of both herbicides, and it was found a maximum recharge of atrazine in the ground waters for April 1998 and of alachlor in October 1997 and October 1998. The temporal evolution of the concentrations of both herbicides in surface waters was parallel. The highly significant correlations observed between atrazine concentrations determined by ELISA and by HPLC (r = 0.92, p < 0.001) and between alachlor concentrations also determined by both methods (r = 0.96, p < 0.001) confirmed the usefulness of ELISA for monitoring both herbicides in an elevated number of samples. Using HPLC, the presence in some waters of the alachlor ethanesulfonate (ESA) metabolite was found at a concentration range of 0.52-4.01 microg L(-1). However the interference of ESA in the determination of alachlor by ELISA was negligible. The inputs of atrazine and alachlor to waters found in this study, especially the inputs to ground waters, could pose a risk for human health considering that some waters, though sporadically, are even used for human consumption."

Four different types of food matrices were chosen for validation: apple puree for infants (high water content), hazelnuts (high fat content), maize (high starch and low fat content) and green pepper (difficult or unique matrix). Method accuracy and precision was evaluated using spiked samples in five replicates at two concentration levels. Method trueness was demonstrated through participation in various proficiency tests. Although the method covers a total number of 331 analytes, validation data were acquired only for 295 analytes, either due to the non-availability of analytical standards or due other reasons described in this paper. Concerning the apparent recovery, the percentage of 295 analytes matching the acceptable recovery range of 70-120% lied down by SANCO varied from 21% in green pepper to 74% in apple puree at the highest spiking level. At the levels close to limit of quantification only 20-58% of the analytes fulfilled this criterion. The extent of matrix effects was strongly dependent on the analyte/matrix combination. In general, the lowest matrix effects were observed in apple puree (59% of analytes were not influenced by enhancement/suppression at all at the highest validation level). The highest matrix effects were observed in green pepper, where only 10% of analytes did not suffer from signal suppression/enhancement. The repeatability of the method was acceptable (RSD‚â§20) for 97% of all analytes in apple puree and hazelnuts, for 95% in maize and for 89% in green pepper. Concerning the trueness of the method, Z-scores were generally between -2 and 2, despite a broad variety of different matrices. Based on these results it can be concluded that quantitative determination of mycotoxins by LC-MS/MS based on a ""dilute and shoot"" approach is also feasible in case of complex matrices."

Little is known about the multi-mycotoxin occurrence in maize and wheat commercially produced in South Africa. This is the first comprehensive study that reports on the multi-mycotoxin occurrence in South African produced maize and wheat crops after harvest, over four production seasons, in all the production regions of the country. The study was made possible with the development of a fit-for-purpose, cost-effective LC-MS/MS multi-mycotoxin method, validated for 13 ""regulated"" mycotoxins. A low mycotoxin risk was found in South African produced wheat, with only deoxynivalenol (DON) in 12.5% of the 160 samples at levels well below the 2000 ¬µg/kg South African (SA) regulatory level.

The present study explored the yield gap in chicken production in Tanzania and analyses the potential of increased chicken production as a result of closing the feed gaps. The study focused on feed aspects limiting dual-purpose chicken production in semi-intensive and intensive systems. A total of 101 farmers were interviewed using a semistructured questionnaire and the amount of feed provided to chickens per day was quantified. Feed was sampled for laboratory analysis and physical assessments were made of weights of chicken bodies and eggs. The results were compared with the recommendations for improved dual-purpose crossbred chickens, exotic layers, and broilers. The results show that the feeds were offered in insufficient quantity compared with the recommendations for laying hens (125 g/chicken unit/d). Indigenous chickens were fed 111 and 67 while the improved crossbred chickens were fed 118 and 119 g/chicken unit/d under semi-intensive and intensive systems, respectively. Most feeds fed to dual-purpose chickens were of low nutritional quality, particularly lacking in crude protein and essential amino acids in both rearing systems and breeds. Maize bran, sunflower seedcake, and fishmeal were the main sources of energy and protein in the study area. The study findings show that the important feed ingredients: protein sources, essential amino acids, and premixes were expensive, and were not included in formulating compound feeds by most chicken farmers. Of all 101 respondents interviewed, only one was aware of aflatoxin contamination and its effects on animal and human health. All feed samples contained a detectable concentration of aflatoxins and 16% of them exceeded the allowed toxicity thresholds (>20 ¬µg/kg).

In addition, other samples including greenhouse vegetables (81), fertilizers (50), and irrigation water (10) were also collected in the studied region. To illustrate the accumulation characteristics of heavy metals in GSGV and greenhouse vegetables, the heavy metal content of different samples was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technology. The results indicated that the heavy metal content in GSGV was much higher than that in FGM and FS except for lead (Pb). Heavy metals including cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) in GSGV presented with various degrees of accumulation. The mean value of Cd content in the soils in the investigation region was 0.45 mg¬∑kg-1, with about 42.8% of all the soil samples exceeding the Cd content criterion of the Environmental Quality Evaluation Standard for Farmland in Greenhouse Vegetable Production (HJ 333-2006). The content of the other heavy metals was in the normal range, and all met the regulations of the standard. In comparison with different vegetable categories, leafy vegetables showed much higher heavy metal concentrations (Cd 0.033 mg¬∑kg-1 fresh weight) than did fruity ones. In total, about 2.5% and 1.2% of vegetable samples exceeded the regulated values of Cd and Pb recommended by the Standard of Food limits, respectively. With the cultivation time prolonged, heavy metal concentration in soils and vegetables all increased synchronously as the pH value decreased. The content of heavy metals in greenhouse vegetables was significantly influenced by soil pH and organic matter. It can be concluded that the health risk of greenhouse vegetables increased with GSGV accumulating more heavy metals due to the substantial application of chemical fertilizer and manure containing high level of heavy metals."

High-quality trace analysis of pyrethroids in biological samples was necessary to assess the health risk of environmentally encountered levels. Currently used highly sensitive methods to measure pyrethroids have focused on large-volume samples related to environmental exposure (water, soil, food products) or urine; however, there are no validated methods for quantifying this class of compounds in small-volume rat liver and muscle tissue homogenates. Individual rat tissue homogenate samples (300 ŒºL) were prepared by protein precipitation using hexane-saturated acetonitrile. The samples were mixed on a vortex mixer and decanted into a d-SPE tube containing octadecylsilyl (C18) and primary secondary amine (PSA) sorbents and magnesium sulfate. The samples were centrifuged before evaporation to dryness. Pyrethroids were extracted and reconstituted from the residue using toluene in advance of injection into an Agilent Model 6890N gas chromatograph equipped with a Model 5973 quadrupole mass analyzer. Samples were ionized via electron capture in the negative ion mode using methane as a chemical ionization gas. Six qualifying ions were monitored using selected-ion monitoring for quantitation and verification of the analyte. Cis-permethrin was used as the internal standard.

This study compares the aquatic fate, concentration levels, and dynamics of the transformation product metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid (metolachlor ESA) and its parent compound metolachlor, an often-used corn herbicide. To this end, laboratory photolysis studies were combined with highly temporally resolved concentration measurements and lake mass balance modeling in the study area of Lake Greifensee (Switzerland). It is found that the two compounds show distinctly different concentration dynamics in the lake tributaries. Concentration-discharge relationships for metolachlor ESA in the main tributary showed a high baseflow concentration and increasing discharge dependence during harvest season, whereas baseflow concentrations of metolachlor were negligible and the discharge dependence was restricted to the period immediately following application. From this it was estimated that 70% of the yearly load of metolachlor ESA to the lake was due to groundwater recharge, whereas, for metolachlor, the bigger part of the load, 50-80%, stemmed from event-driven runoff. Lake mass balance modeling showed that the input dynamics of metolachlor and metolachlor ESA are reflected in their concentration dynamics in the lake's epilimnion and that both compounds show a similar fate in the epilimnion of Lake Greifensee during the summer months with half-lives on the order of 100-200 days, attributable to photolysis and another loss process of similar magnitude, potentially biodegradation. The behavior of metolachlor ESA can likely be generalized to other persistent and highly mobile transformation products. In the future, this distinctly different behavior of mobile pesticide transformation products should find a more appropriate reflection in exposure models used in chemical risk assessment and in pesticide risk management."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to test whether the maize litter enhances degradation of 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) and increases formation of non-toxic biogenic non-extractable residues (bioNERs). Soil was amended with 13C6-MCPA and incubated with or without litter addition on the top. Three soil layers were sampled with increasing distance from the top: 0-2¬†mm, 2-5¬†mm and 5-20¬†mm; and the mass balance of 13C6-MCPA transformation determined. Maize litter promoted microbial activity, mineralization of 13C6-MCPA and bioNER formation in the upper two layers (0-2 and 2-5¬†mm). The mineralization of 13C6-MCPA in soil with litter increased to 27% compared to only 6% in the control. Accordingly, maize addition reduced the amount of extractable residual MCPA in soil from 77% (control) to 35% of initially applied 13C6-MCPA. While non-extractable residues (NERs) were <6% in control soil, litter addition raised NERs to 21%. Thereby, bioNERs comprised 14% of 13C6-MCPA equivalents. We found characteristic differences of bioNER formation with distance to litter. While total NERs in soil at a distance of 2-5¬†mm were mostly identified as 13C-bioNERs (97%), only 45-46% of total NERs were assigned to bioNERs in the 0-2 and 5-20¬†mm layers. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis indicated that fungi and Gram-negative bacteria were mainly involved in MCPA degradation. Maize-C particularly stimulated fungal activity in the adjacent soil, which presumably facilitated non-biogenic NER formation. The plant litter accelerated formation of both non-toxic bioNERs and non-biogenic NERs. More studies on the structural composition of non-biogenic NERs with toxicity potential are needed for future recommendations on litter addition in agriculture."

Aflatoxins are toxic mold metabolites produced by toxigenic strains of Aspergillus species. Primary commodities susceptible to aflatoxin contamination include corn, peanuts and cottonseed and animal-derived foods such as milk when the animal is fed aflatoxin-contaminated feed. Risks associated with aflatoxin-contaminated foods can be reduced through the use of specific processing and decontamination procedures. Factors, which influence the effectiveness of a specific process or procedure, include the chemical stability of the mycotoxin(s), nature of the process, type and interaction with the food/feed matrix and interaction with multiple mycotoxins if present. Practical decontamination procedures must: 1) inactivate, destroy, or remove the toxin, 2) not produce or leave toxic residues in the food/feed, 3) retain the nutritive value of the food/feed, 4) not alter the acceptability or the technological properties of the product, and, if possible, 5) destroy fungal spores. For aflatoxins, multiple processing and/or decontamination schemes have been successful in reducing aflatoxin concentrations to acceptable levels. Physical cleaning and separation procedures, where the mold-damaged kernel/seed/nut is removed from the intact commodity, can result in 40-80% reduction in aflatoxins levels. Processes such as dry and wet milling result in the distribution of aflatoxin residues into less utilized fractions of the commodity. The ammoniation of aflatoxin-contaminated commodities has altered the concentrations as well as toxic and carcinogenic effects of aflatoxin by greater than 99%. Nonbiological materials such as selected anticaking agents covalently bind aflatoxins from aqueous suspensions, diminish aflatoxin uptake by animals, prevent acute aflatoxicosis, and decrease aflatoxin residues in milk. Ultimately, the best processing or decontamination process is one that is approved by regulatory agencies, cost-effective, and reduces the mycotoxin concentration to acceptable levels."

To assess the potential pleiotropic effect of genetic modifications on constituents of modified crops data from US and EC documents were investigated with regard to inherent plant toxins and antinutrients. Analysed were documents of rape (glucosinolates, phytate), maize (phytate), tomato (tomatine, solanine, chaconine, lectins, oxalate), potato (solanine, chaconine, protease-inhibitors, phenols) and soybean (protease-inhibitors, lectins, isoflavones, phytate). In several documents used for notifications no declarations even on essential inherent plant toxins and antinutrients could be found, for instance data on phytate in modified maize were provided only in one of four documents. Significant variations in the contents of these compounds in parental and modified plants especially due to environmental influences were observed: drought stress, for example, was made responsible for significantly increased glucosinolate levels of up to 72.6micromol/g meal in modified and parental rape plants in field trials compared to recommended standard concentrations of less than 30micromol/g. Taking into account these wide natural variations generally the concentrations of inherent plant toxins and antinutrients in modified products were in the range of the concentrations in parental organisms. The results presented indicate that the concept of the substantial equivalence is useful for the risk assessment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) used for novel foods but possible environmental influences on constituents of modified crops need more attention. Consistent guidelines, specifying data of relevant compounds which have to be provided for notification documents of specific organisms have to be established. Because of the importance of inherent plant toxins and antinutrients on nutritional safety, also coherent databases of standard parental lines and clear criteria for mandatory declarations are necessary."

Although fludioxonil, a phenylpyrrole fungicide with a broad spectrum of activity, was introduced in the 1990s, no baseline sensitivity has been established for B. maydis. One hundred field isolates were used to establish a baseline sensitivity of B. maydis against fludioxonil during 2015-2016. The results showed that the baseline sensitivity was distributed as a unimodal curve with a mean EC50 value of 0.044¬±0.022ŒºgmL-1. With repeated exposure to fludioxonil, a total of five fludioxonil-resistant mutants (RF>100, RF=Resistance factor) were obtained in the laboratory. Compared with the parental isolates, the five fludioxonil-resistant mutants showed decreased fitness in sporulation and virulence, and exhibited different features of sensitivity to various stresses (oxidation and osmotic pressure, cell membrane and cell wall inhibitors), but not in mycelial growth on PDA without stress amendation. The five fludioxonil-resistant mutants showed a positive cross-resistance between fludioxonil and the dicarboximide fungicide procymidone, but not between fludioxonil and boscalid or fluazinam. All mutants exhibited stable resistance to fludioxonil after 10 transfers, as indicated by resistance factor values that ranged from 116.82 to 445.59. When treated with 1.0 M NaCl, all the fludioxonil-resistant mutants showed greater mycelial glycerol content than corresponding parental isolates.

World production is around 790 million tonnes of maize because as a staple food it provides more than one-third of the calories and proteins in some countries. Stored maize is a man-made ecosystem in which quality and nutritive changes occur because of interactions between physical, chemical and biological factors. Fungal spoilage and mycotoxin contamination are of major concern. Aspergillus and Fusarium species can infect maize pre-harvest, and mycotoxin contamination can increase if storage conditions are poorly managed. Prevention strategies to reduce the impact of mycotoxin in maize food and feed chains are based on using a hazard analysis critical control point systems (HACCP) approach. To reduce or prevent production of mycotoxins, drying should take place soon after harvest and as rapidly as feasible. The critical water content for safe storage corresponds to a water activity (a(w)) of about 0.7. Problems in maintaining an adequately low a(w) often occur in the tropics where high ambient humidity make the control of commodity moisture difficult. Damage grain is more prone to fungal invasion and, therefore, mycotoxin contamination. It is important to avoid damage before and during drying, and during storage. Drying maize on the cob before shelling is a very good practice. In storage, many insect species attack grain and the moisture that can accumulate from their activities provides ideal conditions for fungal activity. To avoid moisture and fungal contamination, it is essential that the numbers of insects in stored maize should be kept to a minimum. It is possible to control fungal growth in stored commodities by controlled atmospheres, preservatives or natural inhibitors. Studies using antioxidants, essential oils under different conditions of a(w), and temperature and controlled atmospheres have been evaluated as possible strategies for the reduction of fungal growth and mycotoxin (aflatoxins and fumonisins) in stored maize, but the cost of these treatments is likely to remain prohibitive for large-scale use."

Fumonisins occurred in 20.83% of wheat, 40% of barley, and 57.14% of maize samples, at levels exceeding European limits and suggesting a risk in Tunisian cereals, especially maize. Zearalenone, DON, NIV, and T-2+HT-2 toxins were detected at lower values in only wheat and barley samples. PCR protocols showed the predominance of F. verticillioides especially in maize, and occurrence of F. equiseti and F. graminearum in wheat and barley, and F. proliferatum in only two maize samples. A very consistent correlation was found between the detection of F. verticillioides and the contamination by fumonisins, as well as between the presence of F. graminearum and the contamination by zearalenone, DON, and NIV in the analyzed cereals. Consequently, the detection of Fusarium species with the current PCR assays strategy in wheat, barley, and maize grains may be considered predictive of their potential mycotoxin risk in these matrices.

The AITL method accounts for the total mass of insecticides used in the US, acute toxicity to insects using honey bee contact and oral LD50 as reference values for arthropod toxicity, and the environmental persistence of the pesticides. This screening analysis shows that the types of synthetic insecticides applied to agricultural lands have fundamentally shifted over the last two decades from predominantly organophosphorus and N-methyl carbamate pesticides to a mix dominated by neonicotinoids and pyrethroids. The neonicotinoids are generally applied to US agricultural land at lower application rates per acre; however, they are considerably more toxic to insects and generally persist longer in the environment. We found a 48- and 4-fold increase in AITL from 1992 to 2014 for oral and contact toxicity, respectively. Neonicotinoids are primarily responsible for this increase, representing between 61 to nearly 99 percent of the total toxicity loading in 2014. The crops most responsible for the increase in AITL are corn and soybeans, with particularly large increases in relative soybean contributions to AITL between 2010 and 2014. Oral exposures are of potentially greater concern because of the relatively higher toxicity (low LD50s) and greater likelihood of exposure from residues in pollen, nectar, guttation water, and other environmental media. Using AITL to assess oral toxicity by class of pesticide, the neonicotinoids accounted for nearly 92 percent of total AITL from 1992 to 2014. Chlorpyrifos, the fifth most widely used insecticide during this time contributed just 1.4 percent of total AITL based on oral LD50s. Although we use some simplifying assumptions, our screening analysis demonstrates an increase in pesticide toxicity loading over the past 26 years, which potentially threatens the health of honey bees and other pollinators and may contribute to declines in beneficial insect populations as well as insectivorous birds and other insect consumers."

Thus, there is a need to assess risks of these insecticides to monarch butterfly life stages to inform habitat conservation practices. Chronic and acute dietary toxicity studies were undertaken with larvae and adults, and acute topical bioassays were conducted with eggs, pupae, and adults using 6 representative insecticides: beta-cyfluthrin (pyrethroid), chlorantraniliprole (anthranilic diamide), chlorpyrifos (organophosphate), imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam (neonicotinoids). Chronic dietary median lethal concentration values for monarch larvae ranged from 1.6‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10-3 (chlorantraniliprole) to 5.3 (chlorpyrifos) Œºg/g milkweed leaf, with the neonicotinoids producing high rates of arrested pupal ecdysis.

The toxicity results were compared to insecticide exposure estimates derived from a spray drift model and/or milkweed residue data reported in the literature. Aerial applications of foliar insecticides are expected to cause high downwind mortality in larvae and eggs, with lower mortality predicted for adults and pupae. Neonicotinoid seed treatments are expected to cause little to no downslope mortality and/or sublethal effects in larvae and adults.

To test this hypothesis, the environmental impact of various herbicide regimes currently used with non-GMHR maize in Belgium was calculated and compared with that of possible herbicide regimes applied in GMHR maize. Impacts on human health and the environment were calculated through the pesticide occupational and environmental risk (POCER) indicator. Results showed that the environmental impact of herbicide regimes solely relying on the active ingredients glyphosate (GLY) or glufosinate-ammonium (GLU) is lower than that of herbicide regimes applied in non-GMHR maize. Due to the lower potential of GLY and GLU to contaminate ground water and their lower acute toxicity to aquatic organisms, the POCER exceedence factor values for the environment were reduced approximately by a sixth when GLY or GLU is used alone. However, the environmental impact of novel herbicide regimes tested may be underestimated due to the assumption that active ingredients used with GMHR maize would be used alone. Data retrieved from literature suggest that weed control efficacy is increased and resistance development delayed when GLY or GLU is used together with other herbicides in the GMHR system. Due to the partial instead of complete replacement of currently used herbicide regimes, the beneficial environmental impact of novel herbicide regimes might sometimes be reduced or counterbalanced. Despite the high weed control efficacy provided by the biotechnology-based weed management strategy, neither indirect harmful effects on farmland biodiversity through losses in food resources and shelter, nor shifts in weed communities have been demonstrated in GMHR maize yet. However, with the increasing adoption rate of GMHR maize and their associated novel herbicide regimes, this situation is expected to change in the short-term."

Three series of laboratory bioassays were conducted to assess fipronil as a potential grain protectant against adults of Sitophilus oryzae (L. ), Tribolium confusum Jacquelin du Val, Rhyzopertha dominica (F. ) and Prostephanus truncatus (Horn). Factors such as dose (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg fipronil kg(-1) grain), exposure interval (24 h, 48 h, 7 days and 14 days), temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees C), relative humidity (RH; 55 and 65%) and commodity (wheat, maize, barley and paddy rice) were evaluated with regard to their impact on the insecticidal activity of fipronil. Progeny production was assessed after 64 days of exposure. At doses of < 1 mg fipronil kg(-1) grain, efficacy of fipronil was enhanced by an increase in temperature from 20 to 25 degrees C against S. oryzae or R. dominica for exposures of > 48 h and against T. confusum or P. truncatus for exposures of > 24 h. A further increase in temperature from 25 to 30 degrees C, although it enhanced efficacy at doses of < 1 mg fipronil kg(-1) grain against S. oryzae at all exposure intervals and against T. confusum after 7 days of exposure, it was negatively associated with efficacy against R. dominica or P. truncatus for exposures of > 24 h. By contrast, increase in RH did not have a significant impact on efficacy of fipronil. Although the performance of fipronil among the tested commodities was species dependent, this substance appeared to be less effective in paddy rice than in barley, maize and wheat. Regardless of the treated commodity, progeny production of all the tested species was almost suppressed with doses higher than 0.1 mg fipronil kg(-1) grain. Fipronil appeared to be a very effective alternative to the existing substances in stored-grain protection at doses equal to or higher than 1 mg fipronil kg(-1) grain, and thus these doses require further evaluation in terms of safety for the consumer and residues on stored products."

As scarce information is available, the current study is aimed at collecting new data on the co-occurrence and the fate of the most frequent masked, modified and emerging mycotoxins and other second fungal metabolites in maize food products and by-products. Three maize lots, obtained in different growing seasons, were processed using two different degermination processes, a dry-degermination system or a tempering-degermination one, in order to compare the interaction between mycotoxins and the dry-milling management system. Whole grain before and after cleaning, and all the products and the by-products were sampled twice for each lot and were subjected to a multi-mycotoxin LC-MS/MS analysis. More than 30 mycotoxins and other fungal metabolites, including masked or modified forms, co-occurred in all the maize milling fractions. Grain cleaning reduced all the detected fungal metabolites by 1.2-2 times, compared to the grain before cleaning. Animal feed flour showed the highest content of almost all the mycotoxins and fungal metabolites, with a consequent negative impact on animal health. Considering that for all the mycotoxins and fungal metabolites an inverse relationship with particle size was observed, flaking grits represented the healthiest maize products with the least contamination level, while the abatement was always lower for maize flour. Furthermore, the metabolites were variably redistributed in the maize fractions. The total aflatoxins, kojic acid, deoxynivalenol and its modified form, culmorin, and its associated forms, butenolide, fusaproliferin, fusaric acid, fusarinolic acid and, in some cases, zearalenone and its modified forms, and fusarin C were found to be concentrated significantly in the germ.

However, limited data is available on the prevalence of Listeria in frozen produce. A study of frozen fruit and vegetables from catering and retail premises in England was therefore carried out to assess their microbiological quality with respect to Listeria and Escherichia coli.

For 8 of the 10 clusters, the isolates came from homogenous food types: four were sweet corn, and there was one cluster each for beans, peas, peppers and broccoli. There were five genetic associations between isolates from frozen vegetables and from clinical cases of listeriosis, including two cultures from frozen beans that were indistinguishable from the 2015-2018 sweet corn outbreak strain. This study indicates that L. monocytogenes was present in 10% of frozen vegetables and even though products are generally not ready-to-eat and are intended to be cooked prior to consumption, these have the potential to cause illness. Clear cooking and handling instructions are therefore required on these products to ensure that the health of consumers is not put at risk, and appropriate Good Manufacturing Practice measures should be followed by all fruit and vegetable freezing plants in order to reduce contamination with Listeria during processing."

They cause liver and kidney toxicity in animals in addition to leukoencephalomalacia in horses and pulmonary edema in pigs. Fumonisin B(1) is carcinogenic in rats and mice. Ecological studies have linked consumption of fumonisin contaminated maize with oesophageal cancer in human populations in South Africa and China. This review discusses the potential health risks for people exposed to the fumonisins, and describes how mechanistic studies of toxicity in animal models have allowed the development of putative biomarkers of fumonisin exposure at the individual level. The requirements for an applicable biomarker include sample availability as well as a high specificity and sensitivity for the exposure of interest. Most environmental toxic insults involve complex exposures both to other toxins and to infections; these confounding factors need to be considered in assessing both the validity of the biomarker and the exposure-disease associations. Fumonisins can be detected in the urine of animals in feeding studies but the sensitivity of the current methodology means only highly exposed people could be monitored. Mechanistic studies indicate that ceramide synthase, an enzyme involved in sphingolipid synthesis, is one cellular target for fumonisin toxicity and carcinogenicity, and this disruption to sphingolipid metabolism increases the ratio of two sphingoid precursors, sphinganine and sphingosine. The altered ratio has been observed in tissues, serum and urine for a number of animal models suggesting it as a good candidate marker of fumonisin exposure. Despite development of analytical methods to measure this biomarker there have been no studies to date correlating it to fumonisin intake in people. Given the toxic effects of fumonisins in animals and the widespread human exposure, which has been calculated to reach 440 micrograms kg(-1) body weight day(-1) in a population consuming high quantities (460 g day(-1)) of contaminated maize, then the development of biomarkers and their application in epidemiological studies should be a priority for research on these toxins."

Apart from 2002-2003, Fusarium occurrence was not significantly different from one zone to another, although a slight decrease was observed from south, humid, to north, drier. Fusarium occurrence varied somewhat from one season to another. It significantly decreased over the 6 months of storage. Widespread fumonisin occurrence in maize was observed. Most of the maize samples collected were found positive for fumonisin with levels ranging from not detected to 12 mg/kg in 1999-2000, 6.7 mg/kg in 2000-2001 and 6.1 mg/kg in 2002-2003. Fumonisin levels in maize were found to be significantly higher in the two southern zones during all the surveys. The highest mean total fumonisin level was detected in 1999-2000 in maize samples from the southern Guinea Savannah (SGS) (12 mg/kg), whereas in both 2000-2001 and 2002-2003, it was in samples from the forest mosaic savannah (FMS) (6.7 and 6.1 mg/kg, respectively). Fumonisin levels varied from one season to another and, throughout the storage time, showing a decreasing trend in each zone. However, this decrease was not significant every season. An increasing trend was observed during some seasons in the SGS and northern Guinea Savannah (NGS) zones. The results of this study emphasise that farmers and consumers, not only in Benin but also in other West African countries, should be alerted to the danger of fumonisin contamination in maize."

In the present study, field and pot trials were carried out at the experimental farm of the University of Padova at Legnaro (NE Italy) in a silty-loam soil in order to investigate the effects of soil amendment with wood ash (0.1% w/w, incorporated into the 0.2-m top soil) on the bioavailability of mineral elements and their uptake by maize. Characteristics analyzed included plant growth, leaf transpiration dynamics, and productivity in two contrasting hybrids, P1921 (drought sensitive) and D24 (drought tolerant). Wood ash contained relevant amounts of Ca, K, Mg, P, and S, and hazardous levels of Zn (732 mg kg-1), Pb (527 mg kg-1), and Cu (129 mg kg-1), although no significant changes in total soil element concentration, pH, and electrical conductivity were detected in open field. Ash application led to a general increasing trend of diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA)-extractable of various elements, bringing to higher grain P in D24 hybrid, and Zn and Ni reductions in P1921 hybrid. Here, the results demonstrated that ash amendment enhanced shoot growth and the number of leaves, causing a reduction of harvest index, without affecting grain yield in both hybrids. The most relevant result was a retarded inhibition of leaf transpiration under artificial progressive water stress, particularly in the drought-tolerant D24 hybrid that could be sustained by root growth improvements in the field across the whole 0-1.5 m soil profile in D24, and in the amended top soil in P1921. It is concluded that woody ash can be profitably exploited in maize fertilization for enhancing shoot and root growth and drought tolerance, thanks to morphological and physiological improvements, although major benefits are expected to be achieved in drought tolerant hybrids. Attention should be payed when using ash derived by metal contaminated wood stocks to avoid any health risk in food uses."

Fusarium mold is a major plant pathogen and produces a number of trichothecene mycotoxins including deoxynivalenol (or vomitoxin), nivalenol, diacetoxyscirpenol, and T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin. Monogastrics are sensitive to vomitoxin, while poultry and ruminants appear to be less sensitive to some trichothecenes through microbial metabolism of trichothecenes in the gastrointestinal tract. Trichothecene mycotoxins occur worldwide however both total concentrations and the particular mix of toxins present vary with environmental conditions. Proper agricultural practices such as avoiding late harvests, removing overwintered stubble from fields, and avoiding a corn/wheat rotation that favors Fusarium growth in residue can reduce trichothecene contamination of grains. Due to the vague nature of toxic effects attributed to low concentrations of trichothecenes, a solid link between low level exposure and a specific trichothecene is difficult to establish. Multiple factors, such as nutrition, management, and environmental conditions impact animal health and need to be evaluated with the knowledge of the mycotoxin and concentrations known to cause adverse health effects. Future research evaluating the impact of low-level exposure on livestock may clarify the potential impact on immunity. Trichothecenes are rapidly excreted from animals, and residues in edible tissues, milk, or eggs are likely negligible. In chronic exposures to trichothecenes, once the contaminated feed is removed and exposure stopped, animals generally have an excellent prognosis for recovery. This review shows the occurrence of trichothecenes in food and feed in 2011-2020 and their toxic effects and provides a summary of the discussions on the potential public health concerns specifically related to trichothecenes residues in foods associated with the exposure of farm animals to mycotoxin-contaminated feeds and impact to human health.

Methods: The data of DON concentration in cereals was derived from the national food safety risk surveillance from 2010 to 2017, with 15 422 samples of cereals included. China was roughly divided into north part and south part, along with the Qinling Mountains-Huaihe River line. Sample size of each type of cereals, i. e. wheat flour, maize meal, oats and rice was 4 948, 696, 626, 1 006 in the north, while 5 648, 1 068, 266, 1 164 in the south. The data of cereals consumption was derived from China National Nutrition and Health Survey in 2002 and 68 335 respondents aged 3 and above, with 34 234 from the north and 34 101 from the south, were included. Simple distribution model was applied for calculation and comparison of the dietary exposure to DON from cereals in northern and southern residents based on individual consumption of cereals, body weight and average DON concentration in each type of cereals. Results: Average DON concentration in wheat flour, maize meal, oats, and rice sampled in northern China were 235.4, 121.6, 7.0 and 4.6 Œºg/kg, respectively, while 239.1, 124.3, 29.0 and 15.5 Œºg/kg in cereals sampled in southern China. The average DON exposure from cereals in surveyed Chinese inhabitants was 0.78 Œºg/(kg¬∑d). Among them, the DON exposure of northern residents was higher than that of southern residents (P<0.001), and the average exposures were 1.15 and 0.41 Œºg/(kg¬∑d), respectively. A total of 49.2% of northern residents exceeded provisional maximum tolerable daily intake for DON exposure from cereals, which was much higher than that of southern residents (8.6%) (P<0.001). Wheat-based food products were the main source of DON exposure, with a contribution rate of 96.5% in the north and 68.3% in the south. Average DON exposure was the highest in the 3-6 years [2.12 Œºg/(kg¬∑d) for children in north and 0.73 Œºg/(kg¬∑d) in south].

Recent outbreaks of infections by STM are often associated with non-animal related food, i. e. vegetables, fruits, herbs, sprouts and nuts. One main problem related to consumption of fresh produce is the minimal processing, especially for leafy salads such as corn salad, rocket salad, or lettuce. In this study, we focused on lettuce ( Lactuca sativa ) which is contaminated by STM at higher rates compared to corn salad, resulting in prolonged persistence. We previously described the contribution of Saf fimbriae, type 1 secretion system (T1SS)-secreted BapA, intact LPS, and flagella-mediated motility to adhesion to corn salad leaves. We systematically analyzed factors contributing to adhesion of STM to lettuce leaves. We used the previously established reductionist, synthetic approach to identify factors that contribute to the surface binding of STM to leaves of lettuce by expressing all known adhesive structure by the Tet-on system. The analyses revealed contributions of Lpf fimbriae, Sti fimbriae, autotransported adhesin MisL, T1SS-secreted BapA, intact LPS, and flagella-mediated motility to adhesion of STM to lettuce leaves. In addition, we identified BapA is a potential adhesin involved in binding to corn salad and lettuce leaf surfaces. Gastrointestinal pathogens can be transmitted by animal products, as well as by fresh produce of non-animal origin. The numbers of outbreaks by fresh produce contaminated with gastrointestinal pathogens are increasing, and underline the relevance to human health. The mechanisms involved in the colonization of, persistence on, and transmission by fresh produce are poorly understood and have to be part of further research. Here, we investigated the contribution of adhesive factors of STM in the initial phase of plant colonization, i. e. the binding to the plant surface. Usage of a reductionist, synthetic approach including the controlled surface expression of specific adhesive structures of STM, one at a time, allowed the determination of relevant fimbrial and non-fimbrial adhesins, the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide, the flagella, and chemotaxis to binding to lettuce leaves."

The following results were obtained: (1) Compared with C0, adding biochar (C1, C2) could significantly reduce the Cu concentration in sweet corn, and C2 significantly reduced the Cu concentration in soybean under Cu1 and Cu2; the Cu concentrations in sweet corn and soybeans under Cu1 were lower than 10 mg¬∑kg-1. (2) Compared with MC or MS, C2 significantly reduced the Cu concentration (below the detection limit) in sweet corn and the Cu concentration (1.65 mg¬∑kg-1) in soybean straw in CS under Cu1. The Cu concentration in sweet corn ears and soybean straw in CS under Cu2 also decreased significantly, reaching 1.84 and 10.36 mg¬∑kg-1, respectively.

This study reports the distribution, accumulation and risk assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) in soils from the Corn Belt of northeast China at a regional scale. Concentrations of PAHs, DDT and HCH were 306‚Äê5300, 6.00‚Äì82.0 and 4.07‚Äì15.6‚Äâng‚Äâg‚Åª¬π, respectively. Source analysis suggests PAHs were derived from regional combustion of biomass and coal, except where sites are strongly affected by local sources. The DDT and HCH residues in soils are likely to be derived from previous agricultural applications that have persisted due to slow microbiological degradation under low mean temperatures. Precipitation was only significantly correlated with PAH concentrations, suggesting that precipitation affected PAH but not DDT and HCH distributions at a regional scale. Positive correlations between DDT concentrations and total organic carbon (TOC) contents of soils suggest hydrophobic organic contaminants were associated with organic matter. In contrast, TOC contents were correlated with PAHs in alfisols but not in pedocals. Pedocals contained mainly high molecular weight PAHs, indicating that eluviation affected the accumulation of less hydrophobic organic contaminants. Different correlations between low‚Äêmolecular‚Äêweight PAH and HCH concentrations with TOC contents were found in alfisols, suggesting that contaminant structure may also affect the accumulation of less hydrophobic organic contaminants in these soils. Risk analysis suggested that potential ecological risks related to soils in the Corn Belt may lead to reduced maize production and the potential for human health risks in the future. HIGHLIGHTS: Few studies focus on regional‚Äêscale factors that affect organic contaminant accumulation in soils. Environmental process affects less hydrophobic organic contaminant distribution at regional scale. Precipitation and eluviation affected accumulation of less hydrophobic contaminants in soils.

Mice received either 125, 250, or 500¬†mg/kg/day of glyphosate, or a vehicle via oral gavage for 14¬†days. Urine, plasma, and brain samples were collected on the final day of dosing for analysis via UPLC-MS and ELISAs. Primary cortical neurons were derived from amyloidogenic APP/PS1 pups to evaluate in vitro changes in AŒ≤40-42 burden and cytotoxicity. RNA sequencing was performed on C57BL/6J¬†brain samples to determine changes in the transcriptome. Our analysis revealed that glyphosate infiltrated the brain in a dose-dependent manner and upregulated TNFŒ± in both plasma and brain tissue post-exposure. Notably, glyphosate measures correlated positively with TNFŒ± levels. Glyphosate exposure in APP/PS1 primary cortical neurons increases levels of soluble AŒ≤40-42 and cytotoxicity. RNAseq revealed over 200 differentially expressed genes in a dose-dependent manner and cell-type-specific deconvolution analysis showed enrichment of key biological processes in oligodendrocytes including myelination, axon ensheathment, glial cell development, and oligodendrocyte development. Collectively, these results show for the first time that glyphosate infiltrates the brain, elevates both the expression of TNFŒ± and soluble AŒ≤, and disrupts the transcriptome in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that exposure to this herbicide may have detrimental outcomes regarding the health of the general population."

Therefore, mycotoxin contamination of foods and feeds results is a serious food safety issue and affects the competitiveness of US agriculture in both domestic and export markets. This article highlights research accomplished by Agricultural Research Service (ARS) laboratories on control of pre-harvest toxin contamination by using biocontrol, host-plant resistance enhancement and integrated management systems. Emphasis is placed on the most economically relevant mycotoxins, namely aflatoxins produced by Aspergillus flavus, Link, trichothecenes produced by various Fusarium spp and fumonisins produced by F verticillioides. Significant inroads have been made in establishing various control strategies such as development of atoxigenic biocontrol fungi that can outcompete their closely related, toxigenic cousins in field environments, thus reducing levels of mycotoxins in the crops. Potential biochemical and genetic resistance markers have been identified in crops, particularly in corn, which are being utilized as selectable markers in breeding for resistance to aflatoxin contamination. Prototypes of genetically engineered crops have been developed which: (1) contain genes for resistance to the phytotoxic effects of certain trichothecenes, thereby helping reduce fungal virulence, or (2) contain genes encoding fungal growth inhibitors for reducing fungal infection. Gene clusters housing the genes governing formation of trichothecenes, fumonisins and aflatoxins have been elucidated and are being targeted in strategies to interrupt the biosynthesis of these mycotoxins. Ultimately, a combination of strategies using biocompetitive fungi and enhancement of host-plant resistance may be needed to adequately prevent mycotoxin contamination in the field. To achieve this, plants may be developed that resist fungal infection and/or reduce the toxic effects of the mycotoxins themselves, or interrupt mycotoxin biosynthesis. This research effort could potentially save affected agricultural industries hundreds of millions of dollars during years of serious mycotoxin outbreaks."

They are mainly produced by fungi in the Aspergillus, Penicillium and Fusarium genera. When ingested, inhaled or absorbed through the skin, mycotoxins will cause lowered performance, sickness or death on humans and animals. Factors that contribute to mycotoxin contamination of food and feed in Africa include environmental, socio-economic and food production. Environmental conditions especially high humidity and temperatures favour fungal proliferation resulting in contamination of food and feed. The socio-economic status of majority of inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa predisposes them to consumption of mycotoxin contaminated products either directly or at various points in the food chain. The resulting implications include immuno-suppression, impaired growth, various cancers and death depending on the type, period and amount of exposure. A synergistic effect between mycotoxin exposure and some important diseases in the continent such as malaria, kwashiorkor and HIV/AIDS have been suggested. Mycotoxin concerns have grown during the last few decades because of their implications to human and animal health, productivity, economics of their management and trade. This has led to development of maximum tolerated limits for mycotoxins in various countries. Even with the standards in place, the greatest recorded fatal mycotoxin-poisoning outbreak caused by contamination of maize with aflatoxins occurred in Africa in 2004. Pre-harvest practices; time of harvesting; handling of produce during harvesting; moisture levels at harvesting, transportation, marketing and processing; insect damage all contribute to mycotoxin contamination. Possible intervention strategies include good agricultural practices such as early harvesting, proper drying, sanitation, proper storage and insect management among others. Other possible interventions include biological control, chemical control, decontamination, breeding for resistance as well as surveillance and awareness creation. There is need for efficient, cost-effective sampling and analytical methods that can be used for detection analysis of mycotoxins in developing countries."

Controversies surrounding agricultural biotechnology produced crops and foods commonly focus on human and environmental safety, intellectual property rights, consumer choice, ethics, food security, poverty reduction and environmental conservation. Originally, some consumers were reluctant to accept the first generation agricultural biotechnology products because they appeared to primarily benefit agricultural producers; however, it is clear from continued evaluations that these technologies also improved both the safety and wholesomeness of food and helped improve the environment. Plants engineered to resist insect pests and tolerate less toxic pesticides resulted in improved yields thereby enabling farmers to produce more food per acre while reducing the need for herbicides, pesticides, and water and tilling. An indirect benefit of reduced pest damage in transgenic corn expressing genes to control insect pests is lower levels of mycotoxins, most notably those caused by the genus Fusarium. Mycotoxins are an important regulatory issue globally because of their toxic and carcinogenic potential to humans and animals. Complicating this issue is the fact that toxicological databases for mycotoxins are relatively incomplete compared to other food contaminants. Current debates about agricultural biotechnology and mycotoxins reveal significant differences in perception of associated risks and benefits. When faced with uncertainty, regulators tend to set limits as low as possible. Additionally, some regulators invoke the ""Precautionary Principle"" when limited information is available or disputes over interpretation exist for possible contaminants, including mycotoxins. A major concern regarding use of the ""Precautionary Principle"" is the appearance that regulators can justify setting any limit on the basis of inconclusive or unknown potential hazards of a contaminant which may significantly impact global trade because mycotoxin residues vary widely between countries. This paper describes the current economic and heath impact of these regulations and their impact on international trade."

Obesity is associated with chronic inflammation that contribute to long-term complications, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We hypothesized that obesity may also influence the sensitivity to food contaminants, such as fumonisin B1 (FB1), a mycotoxin produced mainly by the Fusarium verticillioides. FB1, a common contaminant of corn, is the most abundant and best characterized member of the fumonisins family. This toxin provokes severe mycotoxicosis in animals, which leads to hepatotoxicity and alterations in the immune response and intestinal barrier permeability. We investigated here whether diet-induced obesity could modulate the sensitivity to oral FB1 exposure, with emphasis on gut health and hepatotoxicity. The metabolic effects of FB1 were assessed in obese and non-obese male C57BL/6J mice. For 15 weeks, mice received a high-fat diet (HFD) or normal chow diet (CHOW). During the last three weeks, mice were exposed or not to FB1 (10 mg/kg body weight/day) through drinking water. As expected, HFD feeding induced significant body weight gain, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis. FB1-exposed mice displayed a higher sphinganine/sphingosine ratio, a well-known FB1 biomarker of exposure, due to inhibition of ceramide synthases activity by FB1. Combined exposure to HFD and FB1 resulted in body weight loss and a decrease in fasting blood glucose level. This co-exposition also induces gut dysbiosis, an increase in plasma FB1 level, a decrease in liver weight and hepatic steatosis. Moreover, plasma transaminase levels were significantly increased and associated with liver inflammation in HFD/FB1-treated mice. Liver gene expression analysis revealed that the combined exposure to HFD and FB1 was associated with reduced expression of genes involved in lipogenesis and increased expression of immune response and cell cycle-associated genes. These results suggest that, in the context of obesity, FB1 exposure promotes gut dysbiosis and severe liver inflammation. To our knowledge, this study provides the first example of obesity-induced hepatitis in response to a food contaminant."

Therefore, it appears necessary to know and quantify factors affecting soil intake in order to ensure the food safety in outside rearing systems. Thus, soil intake was determined in two Latin square trials with 24 and 12 lactating dairy cows. In Trial 1, the effect of pasture allowance (20 v. 35 kg dry matter (DM) above ground level/cow daily) was studied for two sward types (pure perennial ryegrass v. mixed perennial ryegrass-white clover) in spring. In Trial 2, the effect of pasture allowance (40 v. 65 kg DM above ground level/cow daily) was studied at two supplementation levels (0 or 8 kg DM of a maize silage-based supplement) in autumn. Soil intake was determined by the method based on acid-insoluble ash used as an internal marker. The daily dry soil intake ranged, between treatments, from 0.17 to 0.83 kg per cow in Trial 1 and from 0.15 to 0.85 kg per cow in Trial 2, reaching up to 1.3 kg during some periods. In both trials, soil intake increased with decreasing pasture allowance, by 0.46 and 0.15 kg in Trials 1 and 2, respectively. In Trial 1, this pasture allowance effect was greater on mixed swards than on pure ryegrass swards (0.66 v. 0.26 kg reduction of daily soil intake between medium and low pasture allowance, respectively). In Trial 2, the pasture allowance effect was similar at both supplementation levels. In Trial 2, supplemented cows ate much less soil than unsupplemented cows (0.20 v. 0.75 kg/day, respectively). Differences in soil intake between trials and treatments can be related to grazing conditions, particularly pre-grazing and post-grazing sward height, determining at least in part the time spent grazing close to the ground. A post-grazing sward height lower than 50 mm can be considered as a critical threshold. Finally, a dietary supplement and a low grazing pressure, that is, high pasture allowance increasing post-grazing sward height, would efficiently limit the risk for high level of soil intake, especially when grazing conditions are difficult. Pre-grazing and post-grazing sward heights, as well as faecal crude ash concentration appear to be simple and practical tools for evaluating the risk for critical soil intake in grazing dairy cows."

Much of the popular and scientific media have already decided against fructose and calls for regulation and taxation come from many quarters. There are conflicting data, however. Outcomes attributed to fructose - obesity, high triglycerides and other features of metabolic syndrome - are not found in every experimental test and may be more reliably caused by increased total carbohydrate. In this review, we try to put fructose in perspective by looking at the basic metabolic reactions. We conclude that fructose is best understood as part of carbohydrate metabolism. The pathways of fructose and glucose metabolism converge at the level of the triose-phosphates and, therefore, any downstream effects also occur with glucose. In addition, a substantial part of ingested fructose is turned to glucose. Regulation of fructose metabolism per se, is at the level of substrate control - the lower Km of fructokinase compared to glucokinase will affect the population of triose-phosphates. Generally deleterious effects of administering fructose alone suggest that fructose metabolism is normally controlled in part by glucose. Because the mechanisms of fructose effects are largely those of a carbohydrate, one has to ask what the proper control should be for experiments that compare fructose to glucose. In fact, there is a large literature showing benefits in replacing total carbohydrate with other nutrients, usually fat, and such experiments sensibly constitute the proper control for comparisons of the two sugars. In terms of public health, a rush to judgement analogous to the fat-cholesterol-heart story, is likely to have unpredictable outcome and unintended consequences. Popular opinion cannot be ignored in this problem and comparing fructose to ethanol, for example, is without biochemical correlates. Also, nothing in the biochemistry suggests that sugar is a toxin. Dietary carbohydrate restriction remains the best strategy for obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The specific contribution of the removal of fructose or sucrose to this effect remains unknown."

Knowing the contamination in advance can help to reduce food safety risks and related health issues and economic losses. The current study aimed to develop forecasting models for the contamination of maize grown in Serbia with aflatoxins and fumonisins. An integrated modeling approach was used, linking mechanistic modeling with artificial intelligence, in particular Bayesian network (BN) modeling. Two of such combined models, i. e. , the prediction model for aflatoxins (PREMA) and for fumonisins (PREFUM) in maize, were developed. Data used for developing PREMA were from 867 maize samples, collected in Serbia during the period from 2012 to 2018, of which 190 were also used for developing PREFUM. Both datasets were split randomly in a model training set and a model validation set. With corresponding geographical and meteorological data, the so-called risk indices for total aflatoxins and total fumonisins were calculated using existing mechanistic models. Subsequently, these risk indices were used as input variables for developing the BN models, together with the longitudes and latitudes of the sites at which the samples were collected and related weather data. PREMA and PREFUM were internally and externally validated, resulting in a prediction accuracy of PREMA of, respectively, 83 and 70%, and of PREFUM of 76% and 80%. The capability of PREMA and PREFUM for predicting aflatoxins and fumonisins contamination using data from the early maize growth stages only was explored as well, and promising results were obtained. The integrated approach combining two different modeling techniques, as developed in the current study, was able to overcome the obstacles of unbalanced data and deficiency of the datasets, which are often seen in historical observational data from the food safety domain. The models provide predictions for mycotoxin contamination at the field level; this information can assist stakeholders of the maize supply chain, including farmers, buyers/collectors, and food safety authorities, to take timely decisions for improved mycotoxin control. The developed models can be further validated by applying them into practice, and they can be extended to other European maize growing areas."

Before dose administration, the coffee extract was assessed for its antioxidant potential through FRAP, TPC, and GC-MS analyses. Respective phthalates/coffee doses were administrated orally, once a day for 8¬†weeks consecutively starting from the prepubescent stage. After 56¬†days, mice were acclimated for 4¬†days then dissected. Morphological assessments showed an irregular shape of the ovaries in DEP-treated mice as compared to the control. The average bodyweight of DEP-intoxicated mice (p‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ0.05) increased notably against control, while DEP plus coffee group showed a regular gain in the average weight of mice. The gonado-somatic index showed non-significant variations among all groups. Micrometric studies showed that the diameter of secondary follicles (115¬†¬µm) in the ovaries of DEP-exposed mice (p‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ0.001) decreased significantly as compared to control (204¬†¬µm); conversely, follicular diameter in the coffee control group (248) increased significantly. Serum FSH and LH levels were significantly increased in DEP-exposed mice with a noteworthy decrease in estrogen level while hormonal levels of all other groups were comparable to control. Histological sections of DEP-exposed mice ovaries showed anatomical disruptions contrary to other groups, which were comparable with control. Antioxidant potential was checked in ovaries homogenates; FRAP values showed a notable decrease in DEP group in comparison with the control group, in contrast to G-V, when DEP was co-administrated with coffee.

This study was conducted to assess the ability of the uncalibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to predict annual maximum pesticide concentrations in the flowing water bodies of highly vulnerable small- to medium-sized watersheds. The SWAT was applied to 27 watersheds, largely within the midwest corn belt of the United States, ranging from 20 to 386‚Äâkm2 , and evaluated using consistent input data sets and an uncalibrated parameterization approach. The watersheds were selected from the Atrazine Ecological Exposure Monitoring Program and the Heidelberg Tributary Loading Program, both of which contain high temporal resolution atrazine sampling data from watersheds with exceptionally high vulnerability to atrazine exposure. The model performance was assessed based upon predictions of annual maximum atrazine concentrations in 1-d and 60-d durations, predictions critical in pesticide-threatened and endangered species risk assessments when evaluating potential acute and chronic exposure to aquatic organisms. The simulation results showed that for nearly half of the watersheds simulated, the uncalibrated SWAT model was able to predict annual maximum pesticide concentrations within a narrow range of uncertainty resulting from atrazine application timing patterns. An uncalibrated model's predictive performance is essential for the assessment of pesticide exposure in flowing water bodies, the majority of which have insufficient monitoring data for direct calibration, even in data-rich countries. In situations in which SWAT over- or underpredicted the annual maximum concentrations, the magnitude of the over- or underprediction was commonly less than a factor of 2, indicating that the model and uncalibrated parameterization approach provide a capable method for predicting the aquatic exposure required to support pesticide regulatory decision making.

Within RS, F. graminearum was overrepresented in fields below 600 m in elevation and in fields with higher levels of FHB incidence (P<0.05). Species composition was not significantly influenced by previous crop or the stage of grain development at sampling. Habitat-specific differences in FGSC composition were evaluated in three fields by characterizing a total of 189 isolates collected from corn stubble, air above the wheat canopy, and symptomatic wheat kernels. Significant differences in FGSC composition were observed among these habitats (P<0.001). Most strikingly, F. meridionale and F. cortaderiae of the NIV genotype accounted for the vast majority (>96%) of isolates from corn stubble, whereas F. graminearum with the 15-ADON genotype was dominant (>84%) among isolates from diseased wheat kernels. Potential differences in pathogenic fitness on wheat were also suggested by a greenhouse competitiveness assay in which F. graminearum was recovered at much higher frequency (>90%) than F. meridionale from four wheat varieties inoculated with an equal mixture of F. graminearum and F. meridionale isolates. Taken together, the data presented here suggest that FGSC composition and, consequently, the trichothecene contamination in wheat grown in southern Brazil is influenced by host adaptation and pathogenic fitness. Evidence that F. meridionale and F. cortaderiae with the NIV genotype are regionally significant contributors to FHB may have significant implications for food safety and the economics of cereal production."

The enrichment coefficients of rice, wheat and maize to Cd, Cu and Zn were higher than those to other elements. On the basis of Igeo, it can be indicated that the rhizosphere soil of rice was slightly polluted by Cd and Hg, while the concentrations of the other heavy metals were below the safety limits. The CF and pollution load index (PLI) indicated that the soil in the study area was heavily contaminated with heavy metals. A principal component analysis identified different sources of soil heavy metal pollution, that is, Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd from industrial sources, Cr and Ni from natural sources, and As and Hg from agricultural sources. The carcinogenic risk of heavy metals was related to the intake of crops. Residents in the study area ingest rice, wheat, and corn on a daily basis.

Fatty acids with chain lengths of less than C16 and saturated fatty acids were present at higher concentrations in the milks from the GS and MS farms than in the milk from the BP farms; conversely, fatty acids with chain lengths greater than C18 and unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), including mono- (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), were present at higher concentrations in the milks from the BP farms than in the milks from the GS farms. No significant differences were detected in milk flavor, evaluated as sweetness, body, texture, aftertaste, and palatability, between the milks from the farms with different feeding systems. The proportion of BP in the cow's diet was positively correlated with the concentrations of fatty acids with chain lengths greater than C18 and with UFA, MUFA, and PUFA. In contrast, the proportion of GS in the diet was positively associated with the levels of milk fat, protein, fatty acids with chain lengths less than C16, and SFA. The MUFA, PUFA, UFA, and fatty acids with chain lengths greater than C18 were not associated with any of the milk flavors. These results suggest the regional differences in feeding systems contribute to the differences in the fatty acid compositions of milk at the farm level. However, these differences do not influence the flavor of pasteurized milk. Thus, more specific feed profiles will be required to provide a specific regional flavor to pasteurized milk."

Brazil has been discussing the adoption of the Pesticide in Water Calculator (PWC) to be applied in aquatic pesticide risk assessment. Therefore, a qualitative sensitivity analysis (Morris OAT method) was performed to understand which are the most important local parameters in the PWC to estimate environmental concentrations in surface water (EECSW ). In addition, an exercise made up of two corn scenarios in two Brazilian regions was developed (Uberl√¢ndia [UDI] and Arapoti [ARA]). Two herbicides with different soil-binding properties and modes of action were selected to estimate the EECSW. The results demonstrated that the parameters of importance were different for each site, probably the result of different soil characteristics and meteorological patterns. This outcome suggests that regulatory agencies should consider developing more than one scenario to account for different agricultural regions. For Herbicide 1, the EECSW for UDI were similar to US scenarios, whereas for ARA they were lower. For Herbicide 2, the EECSW for the UDI site was higher than most of the US scenarios, whereas at the ARA site, EECs were similar to four US scenarios and lower than the other six. Local data were used as a refinement, resulting in the decrease in the EECSW for both herbicides in the UDI site. For the ARA site, Herbicide 1 displayed a similar EECSW value, whereas for Herbicide 2, it was lower after the refinement. Overall, these results demonstrated the importance of developing local scenarios to provide more realism to estimate pesticide exposure from its agricultural use and may help regulators to determine and recommend mitigations regarding the use of crop-protection products.

There is accumulating evidence that insecticides adversely affect non-target wildlife species, including birds, causing mortality, reproductive impairment, and indirect effects through loss of prey base, and the type and magnitude of such effects differs by chemical class, or mode of action. In evaluating data for an insecticide registration application and for registration review, scientists at the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) assess the fate of the insecticide and the risk the insecticide poses to the environment and non-target wildlife. Current USEPA risk assessments for pesticides generally rely on endpoints from laboratory based toxicity studies focused on groups of individuals and do not directly assess population-level endpoints. In this paper, we present a mechanistic model, which allows risk assessors to estimate the effects of insecticide exposure on the survival and seasonal productivity of birds known to forage in agricultural fields during their breeding season. This model relies on individual-based toxicity data and translates effects into endpoints meaningful at the population level (i. e. , magnitude of mortality and reproductive impairment). The model was created from two existing USEPA avian risk assessment models, the Terrestrial Investigation Model (TIM v.3.0) and the Markov Chain Nest Productivity model (MCnest). The integrated TIM/MCnest model was used to assess the relative risk of 12 insecticides applied via aerial spray to control corn pests on a suite of 31 avian species known to forage in cornfields in agroecosystems of the Midwest, USA. We found extensive differences in risk to birds among insecticides, with chlorpyrifos and malathion (organophosphates) generally posing the greatest risk, and bifenthrin and Œª-cyhalothrin (pyrethroids) posing the least risk. Comparative sensitivity analysis across the 31 species showed that ecological trait parameters related to the timing of breeding and reproductive output per nest attempt offered the greatest explanatory power for predicting the magnitude of risk. An important advantage of TIM/MCnest is that it allows risk assessors to rationally combine both acute (lethal) and chronic (reproductive) effects into a single unified measure of risk."

Results The average concentrations of chromium and lead in maize exceeded the maximum allowable concentrations in food. The average concentrations of metals in the associated soil and irrigation water were both below the safe limits allowed in China.

Residues of these compounds may remain and contaminate the oil produced. For the analysis of pesticide residues in olive oil, the most common methods are multiresidue methods for fatty substrates, based on partitioning between hexane or light petroleum and acetonitrile. Recently, other methods have been applied, such as ready-to-use, disposable minicolumns or direct injection of oil into a capillary gas chromatograph equipped with a precolumn with an oil recovery tank. Although several pesticides are registered in oil-producing countries for use on olive trees, available literature on the level and fate of residues is very limited. However, it is clear that fat-soluble pesticides tend to concentrate in the oil, both after full coverage and bait spraying, and their use close to harvest should therefore be avoided. Because it is sometimes necessary to use such pesticides late in autumn because of their effectiveness in cases of severe attack, residue trials should be carried out to determine the residue concentration in oil and to set a reasonable preharvest safety interval. Data produced by such trials would permit the establishment of MRLs (tolerances) in olive oil to cover cases where the residues, although relatively high, are not of toxicological significance for consumers (risk assessment). Such is the case with corn oil and the fat-soluble insecticide methyl pirimiphos, registered in the U. S. for use on corn. The U. S. EPA tolerance for methyl pirimiphos in corn is 8 mg/kg, whereas it is 11 times higher (88 mg/kg) for corn oil because it is known to concentrate in the oil. Similar provisions for olive oil, based on data from residue trials according to Good Agricultural Practice, the long-term toxicity of each pesticide as expressed by its ADI for man, and olive oil consumption patterns, would facilitate international trade of this commodity. On the other hand, because of the high dietary and health value of olive oil, it is desirable that toxic pesticide residues be kept as low as possible. Therefore, it would be preferable not to rely only on chemical pest control treatments but to develop and apply alternative plant protection techniques such as Integrated Pest Management (IPM).

Current evidence of the incidence of Aspergillus flavus isolates belonging to vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) lacking the ability to produce aflatoxins (i. e. , atoxigenic) in Ghana may lead to the development of an aflatoxin biocontrol strategy to mitigate crop aflatoxin content. In this study, 12 genetically diverse atoxigenic African A. flavus VCGs (AAVs) were identified from fungal communities associated with maize and groundnut grown in Ghana. Representative isolates of the 12 AAVs were assessed for their ability to inhibit aflatoxin contamination by an aflatoxin-producing isolate in laboratory assays. Then, the 12 isolates were evaluated for their potential as biocontrol agents for aflatoxin mitigation when included in three experimental products (each containing four atoxigenic isolates). The three experimental products were evaluated in 50 maize and 50 groundnut farmers' fields across three agroecological zones (AEZs) in Ghana during the 2014 cropping season. In laboratory assays, the atoxigenic isolates reduced aflatoxin biosynthesis by 87-98% compared to grains inoculated with the aflatoxin-producing isolate alone. In field trials, the applied isolates moved to the crops and had higher (P < 0.05) frequencies than other A. flavus genotypes. In addition, although at lower frequencies, most atoxigenic genotypes were repeatedly found in untreated crops. Aflatoxin levels in treated crops were lower by 70-100% in groundnut and by 50-100% in maize (P < 0.05) than in untreated crops. Results from the current study indicate that combined use of appropriate, well-adapted isolates of atoxigenic AAVs as active ingredients of biocontrol products effectively displace aflatoxin producers and in so doing limit aflatoxin contamination. A member each of eight atoxigenic AAVs with superior competitive potential and wide adaptation across AEZs were selected for further field efficacy trials in Ghana. A major criterion for selection was the atoxigenic isolate's ability to colonize soils and grains after release in crop field soils. Use of isolates belonging to atoxigenic AAVs in biocontrol management strategies has the potential to improve food safety, productivity, and income opportunities for smallholder farmers in Ghana."

We show that the CTB gene cluster has experienced multiple duplications and horizontal transfers across a spectrum of plant pathogenic fungi, including the wide host range Colletotrichum genus as well as the rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Although cercosporin biosynthesis has been thought to-date to rely on an eight gene CTB cluster, our phylogenomic analysis revealed gene collinearity adjacent to the established cluster in all CTB cluster-harboring species. We demonstrate that the CTB cluster is larger than previously recognized and includes cercosporin facilitator protein ( CFP ) previously shown to be involved with cercosporin auto-resistance, and four additional genes required for cercosporin biosynthesis including the final pathway enzymes that install the unusual cercosporin methylenedioxy bridge. Finally, we demonstrate production of cercosporin by Colletotrichum fioriniae , the first known cercosporin producer within this agriculturally important genus. Thus, our results provide new insight into the intricate evolution and biology of a toxin critical to agriculture and broaden the production of cercosporin to another fungal genus containing many plant pathogens of important crops worldwide. Species in the fungal genus Cercospora cause diseases in many important crops worldwide. Their success as pathogens is largely due to the secretion of cercosporin during infection. We report that the cercosporin toxin biosynthesis ( CTB ) cluster is ancient and was horizontally transferred to diverse fungal pathogens on an unprecedented scale. Since these analyses revealed genes adjacent to the established CTB cluster, we evaluated their role in C. beticola to show that four are necessary for cercosporin biosynthesis. Finally, we confirmed that the apple pathogen Colletotrichum fioriniae produces cercosporin, the first case outside the family Mycosphaerellaceae. Other Colletotrichum plant pathogens also harbor the CTB cluster, which points to a wider concern that this toxin may play in virulence and human health."

DON and ZEN occurred with high incidences (100 and 96%) and a wide range of concentrations, reaching levels up to 10,972 and 3910 ¬µg/kg, respectively. Almost half of the samples (46%) exceeded the guidance value in complementary and complete feeding stuffs for ZEN (500 ¬µg/kg), and 9% for DON (5000 ¬µg/kg). The DON related mycotoxins DON3G and 3+15-AcDON were also present in almost all samples (100 and 97%) with amounts of up to 3038 and 2237 ¬µg/kg and a wide range of concentrations. For the ZEN metabolites Œ±- and Œ≤-ZEL lower incidences were detected (59 and 32%) with concentrations of up to 423 and 203 ¬µg/kg, respectively. Forage maize samples were contaminated with at least three co-occurring mycotoxins, whereby 95% of all samples contained four or more mycotoxins with DON, DON3G, 3+15-AcDON, and ZEN co-occurring in 93%, together with Œ±-ZEL in 57% of all samples. Positive correlations were established between concentrations of the co-occurring mycotoxins, especially between DON and its modified forms. Averaged over all samples, ratios of DON3G/DON and 3+15-AcDON/DON were similar, 20.2 and 20.5 mol%; cultivar-specific mean ratios ranged from 14.6 to 24.3 mol% and 15.8 to 24.0 mol%, respectively. In total, 40.7 mol% of the measured DON concentration was present in the modified forms DON3G and 3+15-AcDON. The Œ±-ZEL/ZEN ratio was 6.2 mol%, ranging from 5.2 to 8.6 mol% between cultivars. These results demonstrate that modified mycotoxins contribute substantially to the overall mycotoxin contamination in forage maize. To avoid a considerable underestimation, it is necessary to analyse modified mycotoxins in future mycotoxin monitoring programs together with their parent forms."

Therefore, there is a requisite to propose suitable mitigation strategies to reduce the contamination of fungi and mycotoxins in agricultural commodities. In the present study, combinational inhibitory effect of Hedychium spicatum L. essential oil (HSEO) and radiation was established on growth rate, production of deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA) by Fusarium graminearum in maize grains. The HSEO was obtained from rhizomes by hydrodistillation technique and chemical composition was revealed by GC-MS analysis. A total of 48 compounds were identified and major compounds were 1,8-cineole (23.15%), linalool (12.82%), and Œ≤-pinene (10.06%). The discrete treatments of HSEO and radiation were effective in reducing the fungal growth rate and mycotoxins content, and the complete reduction was noticed at 3.15 mg/g of HSEO and 6 kGy of radiation. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to evaluate the combinational inhibitory effect of HSEO and radiation treatments on fungal growth rate and mycotoxins content. A total of 13 experiments were designed with distinct doses of HSEO and radiation by central composite design (CCD) of Stat-Ease Design-Expert software. In combinational approach, complete reductions of fungal growth, DON, and ZEA content were noticed at 1.89 mg/g of HSEO and 4.12 kGy of radiation treatments. The optimized design concluded that combinational treatments of HSEO and radiation were much more effective in reducing the fungal growth and mycotoxins content compared to their discrete treatments (p < 0.05). Responses of the design were assessed by second-order polynomial regression analysis and found that quadratic model was well fitted. The optimized design has larger F-value and adequate precision, smaller p-value, decent regression coefficients (R2 ) and found statistically significant (p < 0.05). In addition, correlation matrix, normal plot residuals, Box-Cox, and actual vs. predicted plots were endorsed that optimized design was accurate and appropriate. The proposed combinational decontamination technique could be highly applicable in agriculture and food industry to safeguard the food and feed products from fungi and mycotoxins."

This study is focused on high concentrations of Tl in soils in the Lanmuchang area of southwest Guizhou, China, which is related to natural processes of Tl-rich sulfide mineralization. Thallium contents range from 40 to 124 mg/kg in soils originating from the mining area, from 20 to 28 mg/kg in slope wash materials, from 14 to 62 mg/kg in alluvial deposits downstream, from 1.5 to 6.9 mg/kg in undisturbed natural soils and <0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg Tl in soils from the background area. These values indicate that both the erosion of natural soils from the Tl mineralized area and the mining activity are responsible for the distribution of high Tl concentrations in soils. Two other important toxic metals of interest, mercury and arsenic, also show high contents in soils, and are generally higher than Tl concentrations. Thallium concentration in plants exhibit species-dependent preferences. Thus, the enrichment of Tl in the edible parts of crop species decreases in the following order: green cabbage>carrot>chili>Chinese cabbage>rice>corn. The highest level of Tl in green cabbage is up to 500 mg/kg as dry wt. , surpassing the values of Tl in the soils in which the green cabbages grow. In contrast, Hg and As are relatively less concentrated in local plants. The average daily uptake of Tl by the villagers of the Lanmuchang area through consumption of locally planted crops has been estimated to be 1.9 mg/person, which is 50 times the daily ingestion of individuals from the Tl-free background area. The daily ingestion of As and Hg from the study area are 0.03 and 0.01 mg, respectively. This indicates that Tl in the contaminated soils related to the natural Tl mineralization is being readily transferred to the human body through the food chain, and poses a significant threat to the health of the local villagers. Arsenic may pose a lesser health hazard, but mercury has an insignificant health risk. This study illustrates a real environmental concern related to land use and human health in areas containing high contents of Tl in soils associated with the natural occurrence of Tl-rich sulfides and coals, with or without mining activities. Thallium contamination in soils should be a critical parameter for proper land use and health related environmental planning and regulations."

Risk factors for persistent albuminuria were: homestead proximity to maize crops, the use of pesticides at the father's workplace, a family history of CKD and blood pressure abnormalities. The body mass index and breastfeeding were protective factors. The prevalence of persistent albuminuria in adolescents in Aguascalientes is high and histologic compromise is characterized by podocyte injury in the absence of fibrosis. The renal volume of persistent albuminuria patients was decreased, suggesting oligonephronia. Exposure to environmental toxins such as pesticides, even prenatally, may be responsible for this pathological entity.

This study reviewed the accumulation of five selected heavy metals, cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) in soil and the corresponding BAF of Zea mays grown on those soils using a systematic search of peer-reviewed scientific journals. A total of 27 research works were reviewed after screening 52 articles for subject matter relevancy, including dumpsites, industrially polluted soils, inorganically fertilized soils, mining sites, smelting sites, municipal wastewater irrigated soils, and a battery waste dumpsite. Among the reviewed sites, concentrations of Cd and Cr were highest at a tin mining site, where prolonged mining, mineral processing and other production activities contributed heavy metal pollution in the soil. The soil at a battery waste dumpsite exhibited the highest Pb concentration, while the soil at a Zn smelting site presented the highest concentration of Zn. The highest soil Cu concentration was found in an area where sewage irrigation had been carried out over a long period. The BAF of the five heavy metals in Zea mays increased with the metal concentrations in the soil. The BAF of Cd, Cr, Pb, Cu, and Zn in Zea mays from the study areas fall within the ranges of 0-0.95, 0-1.89, 0-1.20, 0.011-0.99, and 0.03-0.99, respectively. Cadmium and Zn had the highest bioconcentration factors values in maize plants, likely due to their higher mobility rate compared to the other heavy metals. The study concluded that Zea mays is capable of accumulating high amounts of heavy metals, although accumulation of these heavy metals is influenced by multiple factors including soil texture, cation exchange capacity, root exudation and especially soil pH and chemical forms of the heavy metals. Zea mays should not be planted on metal-contaminated soils because of its potential to act as a hyperaccumulator. The authors declare no competing financial interests."

Currently, immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC) has become the most conventional sample clean-up method for determining AFs in foodstuffs. However, IAC method is limited in the large-scale food analysis because it requires the use of expensive disposable cartridges and the IA procedure is time-consuming. Herein, to achieve the cost-effective determination of AFs in edible oils, we developed a promising solid-phase extraction (SPE) method based on commercially available humic acid-bonded silica (HAS) sorbent, followed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) analysis. In HAS-SPE, AFs can be captured by the HAS sorbent with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, whereas the oil matrix was captured only with the hydrophobic interactions. The oil matrix can be sufficiently washed off with isopropanol, while the AFs were still retained on the SPE packing, thus achieving selective extraction of AFs and clean-up of oil matrices. Under the optimal conditions of HAS-SPE, satisfactory recoveries ranging from 82% to 106% for four AFs (B1, B2, G1, and G2) were achieved in various oil matrices, containing blended oil, tea oil, rapeseed oil, peanut oil, sunflower seed oil, corn oil, blended olive oil, rice oil, soybean oil, and sesame oil.

In addition, HAS-SPE can directly treat diluted oil sample without liquid-liquid extraction and is automatable, thus making it simple and convenient for the large-scale determination of AFs in edible oils.

In the ancient times, food security was achieved through gathering of fruits, grains, herbs, tubers, and roots from the forests by individual households. Advancements in human civilization led to domestication of crops and a need to save food for not only a household, but the nation. This extended need for food security led to establishment of national reservoirs for major produces and this practice varies greatly in different states. Each of the applied food production, handling and storage approaches has got its benefits and challenges. In sub-Saharan Africa, several countries have a public funded budget to subsidize production costs, to buy grains from farmers and to store the produce for a specific period and/or until the next harvests. During the times of famine, the stored grains are later given free to the citizens. If there is no famine, the grain is sold to retailers and/or processors (e. g. , millers) who later sell it to the consumers. This approach works well if the produce (mainly grain) is stored under conditions that do not favor growth of molds, as some of these could contaminate the grain with toxic and carcinogenic metabolites called mycotoxins. Conditions that alleviate contamination of grains are required during production, handling and storage. Most of the grain is produced by smallholder farmers under sub-optimal conditions, which make vulnerable to colonization and contamination by toxigenic fungi. Further, the grain is stored in silos at large masses, where it is hard to monitor the conditions at different points of these facilities, and hence it becomes vulnerable to additional contamination. Production and storage of grain under conditions that favor mycotoxins poses major food health and safety risks to humans and livestock who consume the grain. This concept paper focuses on how establishment of local grain production and banking system (LGPBS) could enhance food security and safety in East Africa. The concept of LGPBS provides an extension of advisory and finance support within warehouse receipting system to enhance grain production under optimal conditions. The major practices at the LGPBS, and how each could contribute to food security and safety are discussed. While the concept paper gives more strength on maize production and safety, similar practices could be applied to enhance safety of other grains in the same LGPBS."

In this study, we quantified co-occurring mycotoxins in breast milk and food samples from Haryana, India, and characterized determinants of exposure. Deterministic risk assessment was conducted for mothers and infants. We examined levels of eight mycotoxins (Aflatoxin B1 , B2 , G1 , G2 , M1 , M2 ; Ochratoxin A, B) in 100 breast milk samples (infants 2-4 months) using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1 ), fumonisin B1 (FB1 ) and deoxynivalenol (DON) were detected in several food items (n = 298) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. We report novel data on the presence of mycotoxins in breast milk samples from India. Whereas breast milk concentrations (AFM1 median: 13.7; range: 3.9-1200 ng/L) remain low, AFM1 was detected above regulatory limits in 27% of animal milk samples. Additionally, 41% of infants were above provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) limits for AFM1 due to consumption of breast milk (mean: 3.04, range: 0.26-80.7 ng kg-1 bw day-1 ). Maternal consumption of breads (p < 0.05) was associated with breast milk AFM1 exposure. AFB1 (Œºg/kg) was detected in dried red chilies (15.7; 0-302.3), flour (3.13; 0-214.9), groundnuts (0; 0-249.1), maize (56.0; 0-836.7), pearl millet (1.85; 0-160.2), rice (0; 0-195.6), wheat (1.9; 0-196.0) and sorghum (0; 0-63.5). FB1 (mg/kg) was detected in maize (0; 0-61.4), pearl millet (0; 0-35.4) and sorghum (0.95; 0-33.2). DON was not detected in food samples. Mothers in our study exceeded PMTDI recommendations for AFB1 due to consumption of rice and flour (mean: 75.81; range: 35.2-318.2 ng kg-1 bw day-1 ). Our findings show the presence of Aflatoxin B1 and M1 at various levels of the food chain and in breast milk, with estimated intakes exceeding PMTDI recommendations. Aflatoxins are known carcinogens and have also been linked to stunting in children. Their presence across the food system and in breast milk is concerning, thus warranting further research to replicate and expand on our findings and to understand implications for maternal and child health."

The capacities for Cd accumulation in different maize cultivars are, however, not fully understood. To reduce human health risk from maize grown in Cd-contaminated soil and to provide promising maize cultivars for the phytoremediation of Cd-polluted soil, a field experiment was conducted to screen low-Cd- and high-Cd-accumulation maize cultivars by evaluating the yield, Cd uptake, translocation, and accumulation differences among 19 maize cultivars. There were differences in straw dry weight (DW), root DW, and yield among the 19 cultivars. The cultivars Yudan19, Zhengda999, and Xianyu508 had a higher production compared to that of the other cultivars. The Cd concentrations in the roots were much higher than those in the straws and grains in all cultivars. The Cd accumulation factors (AFS) decreased in the order of accumulation factors in root (AFrs) > accumulation factors in straw (AFss) > accumulation factors in grain (AFgs). The Cd translocation factors (TFs) from root to straw (TFrs) were significantly (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) larger than those from straw to grain (TFsg) among all of the cultivars. The TFs for all of the cultivars was less than 1, and the lowest TFsg (0.23) was found in cultivar Xiangyongdan3. The correlation analysis indicated that Cd concentrations in straws showed a significant (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01) as well as positive correlation with TFrs while a negative correlation with TFsg (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01). Moreover, Cd accumulation in different tissues decreased in the order straw > grain > root. Among the 19 maize cultivars, Jixiang2118 and Kangnong18 accumulated the highest Cd amount in the aboveground tissues, and the corresponding values were 7,206.51 and 6,598.68 mg hm(-2), respectively. A hierarchical cluster analysis based on the Cd concentrations in grains and straws classified the 19 maize cultivars into four and two groups for a 0.4 minimum distance between clusters, respectively. Yudan19, Zhengda999, and Xianyu508 can be classified into one group in which low Cd in grains meeting the Cd tolerance limit in foods set by China National Standard, suggesting that those cultivars are safety for food and human health.

Aflatoxins remain a scourge in the country, unprecedentedly reducing the value of agricultural foods and in high enough exposure levels, implicated for hepatocellular carcinoma, stunted growth in children and untimely deaths. This review synthetizes the country‚Äôs major findings in relation to the mycotoxin‚Äôs etiology, epidemiology, detection, quantification, exposure assessment, control and reduction in different matrices. It also highlights some of the management strategies for aflatoxin control that could be adopted in Uganda. Review results indicate that aflatoxins in Uganda is majorly produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus and have been reported in maize ( Zea mays L. ), sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor L. ), sesame ( Sesamum indicum ), beans ( Phaseolus vulgaris L. ), sunflower ( Helianthus annus ), millet ( Eleusine coracana) , a bovine milk-based product, peanuts ( Arachis hypogaea L. ) and cassava ( Manihot esculenta ) with the highest content reported in cassava, beans and peanuts. The causes and proliferation of aflatoxigenic contamination of Ugandan foods have been largely due to poor pre-, peri- and post-harvest activities, poor government legislation, lack of awareness and low levels of education among farmers, agri-entreprenuers and consumers on the plague. Aflatoxin B 1 is the most prevalent aflatoxin in Uganda. There is still limited research on aflatoxins in Uganda because the surveillance, reduction and control carry prohibitive costs. A few exposure assessments have been done especially in human sera and dependence on a single or a related set of foods with little diet diversity has exacerbated the risk of exposure to aflatoxins in Uganda because most of the staple foods are aflatoxin-prone. On the detection, control and reduction, these are still marginal, though some devoted scholars have devised and validated a sensitive portable device for on-site aflatoxin detection in maize as well as shown that starter cultures used for making some cereal-based beverages have the potential to bind aflatoxins. More effort should be geared towards awareness creation through training of farmers and traders in the cereal value chain as well as developing capacity to monitor aflatoxins. Vaccination against Hepatitis B and Hepatitis A should be emphasized to reduce the risk of development of liver cancer among the populace."

EU legislation already exists for the aflatoxins, ochratoxin A and patulin in food, and legislation will come into force for deoxynivalenol, zearalenone and the fumonisins in 2007. To enforce the various legal limits, it would be preferable to determine all mycotoxins by routine analysis in different types of matrices in one single extract. This would also be advantageous for HACCP control purposes. For this reason, a multi-method was developed with which 33 mycotoxins in various products could be analysed simultaneously. The mycotoxins were extracted with an acetonitrile/water mixture, diluted with water and then directly injected into a LC-MS/MS system. The mycotoxins were separated by reversed-phase HPLC and detected using an electrospray ionisation interface (ESI) and tandem MS, using MRM in the positive ion mode, to increase specificity for quality control.

The limit of quantification for the aflatoxins and ochratoxin A was 1.0 microg kg(-1) and for deoxynivalenol 50 microg kg(-1). The quantification limits for the other mycotoxins were in the range 10-200 microg kg(-1). The matrix effect and validation data are presented for between 13 and 24 mycotoxins in peanuts, pistachios, wheat, maize, cornflakes, raisins and figs. The method has been compared with the official EU method for the determination of aflatoxins in food and relevant FAPAS rounds. The multi-mycotoxin method has been proven by the detection of more than one mycotoxin in maize, buckwheat, figs and nuts. The LC-MS/MS technique has also been applied to baby food, which is subject to lower limits for aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A, ergot alkaloids in naturally contaminated rye and freeze-dried silage samples."

To resolve those problems, rice straw, wheat straw, corn stalk, corncob, soybean stalk, and soybean hull were selected as denitrification carbon sources to investigate the release mechanisms and potential influences of the organic matter, secondary pollutants, and DOM. The results showed that the six agricultural wastes could be used as the denitrification carbon source. The carbon content in the wheat straw was the highest and the secondary pollution risk from the corncob was the lowest. For the six carbon sources, the second-order kinetic equation and Ritger-Peppas equation were followed during the 1-120 h carbon release process. The fitting results demonstrated that corncob was more suitable for use as the denitrification carbon source because of its moderate cm value and longer t1/2 value, and the release mechanisms of the six types of carbon sources were mainly controlled by the diffusion process. The NH4+-N, TN, and TP contents in the immersion water of the rice straw were higher than those of the five other agricultural wastes, and there was heavy chromaticity in the immersion water of the wheat straw and corn stalk. The amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and chromatic substances released from the corncob were the lowest. The leachates of the corncob and soybean hull had higher biodegradability and lower risks of secondary pollution than those of the other sources. The aromaticity and molecular weight of DOM increased as the reaction time increased, and the humification of DOM was low. Five components were identified by PARAFAC. The main component was protein-like matter, which was mainly composed of tyrosine-like and tryptophan-like substances. There was less humic acid-like matter in the immersion water. The component characteristics of DOM might have had an adverse effect on the subsequent water treatment process. These results could provide theoretical support for the impact on effluent water quality and risk assessment when the agricultural wastes are used as an additional denitrification carbon source at the start-up stage."

The perceived consumer value of PJ is due in large part to its potential health benefits based on a significant body of medical research conducted with authentic PJ. To establish criteria for authenticating PJ, a new International Multidimensional Authenticity Specifications (IMAS) algorithm was developed through consideration of existing databases and comprehensive chemical characterization of 45 commercial juice samples from 23 different manufacturers in the United States. In addition to analysis of commercial juice samples obtained in the United States, data from other analyses of pomegranate juice and fruits including samples from Iran, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Syria, India, and China were considered in developing this protocol. There is universal agreement that the presence of a highly constant group of six anthocyanins together with punicalagins characterizes polyphenols in PJ. At a total sugar concentration of 16 degrees Brix, PJ contains characteristic sugars including mannitol at >0.3 g/100 mL. Ratios of glucose to mannitol of 4-15 and of glucose to fructose of 0.8-1.0 are also characteristic of PJ. In addition, no sucrose should be present because of isomerase activity during commercial processing. Stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry as > -25 per thousand assures that there is no added corn or cane sugar added to PJ. Sorbitol was present at <0.025 g/100 mL; maltose and tartaric acid were not detected. The presence of the amino acid proline at >25 mg/L is indicative of added grape products. Malic acid at >0.1 g/100 mL indicates adulteration with apple, pear, grape, cherry, plum, or aronia juice. Other adulteration methods include the addition of highly concentrated aronia, blueberry, or blackberry juices or natural grape pigments to poor-quality juices to imitate the color of pomegranate juice, which results in abnormal anthocyanin profiles. To adjust the astringent taste of poor-quality juice or peel extract, addition of nonpomegranate sugars is a commonly detected adulteration method. The profile generated from these analyses combined with information from existing databases and published literature has been integrated into a validated IMAS for PJ, which can be utilized to detect PJ adulteration. In this survey of commercial pomegranate juices, only 6 of 23 strictly met all of the IMAS criteria."

As a result, it is employed in a wide variety of agricultural and specialty pest control scenarios. Various formulations of chlorpyrifos have been developed to maximize stability and contact with pests and minimize human exposure. From corn agriculture in the United States to termite control in Japan to cotton agriculture in Egypt to citrus horticulture in Spain, chloropyrifos has been successfully employed to combat insect and other arthropod pests threatening the production of food and fiber and maintenance of human health. Due to the nonpolar nature of the chlorpyrifos molecule, it possesses a low water solubility (< 2 ppm) and great tendency to partition from aqueous into organic phases in the environment (log P of 4.7-5.3). It is characterized by an average soil and sediment sorption coefficient (Koc) of 8498 and aquatic bioconcentration factor of 100-5100 in fish. As a result of its high propensity for sorption, its movement through and over the soil profile is limited. It has been found to be relatively immobile vertically in soil and has not proved to be a groundwater contaminant. Surface runoff and erosion mobility are also low, and, in general, less than 0.3% of soil surface application has been observed to move even under the heaviest simulated precipitation conditions. Chlorpyrifos has an intermediate vapor pressure (2 x 10(-5) mm Hg, 25 degrees C), and under some conditions volatility is a significant mechanism of dissipation. This is especially true for plant foliage, from which it is the major means of loss, to some extent from water surfaces, and to a lesser degree from moist soil surfaces. Chlorpyrifos is a degradable compound, and both abiotic and biotic transformation processes effect its degradation within environmental compartments (Fig. 1). In all cases, the major pathway of transformation involves cleavage of the phosphate ester bond to form 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP). Hydrolytic transformation, although relatively slow in pure water under ideal conditions (half-lives of 29-74 d at pH 7, 25 degrees C), may be catalyzed under certain environmental conditions. These include alkaline conditions in water (pH > or = 8) and alkaline (pH > or = 7.5) and air-dry conditions in soil, and in some soils hydrolysis may be the major means of dissipation (Fig. 2).

Drought stress-responding compounds such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) are associated with fungal stress responsive signaling and secondary metabolite production, and can stimulate the production of aflatoxin by A. flavus in vitro. These secondary metabolites have been shown to possess diverse functions in soil-borne fungi including antibiosis, competitive inhibition of other microbes, and abiotic stress alleviation. Previously, we observed that isolates of A. flavus showed differences in oxidative stress tolerance which correlated with their aflatoxin production capabilities. In order to better understand these isolate-specific oxidative stress responses, we examined the transcriptional responses of field isolates of A. flavus with varying levels of aflatoxin production (NRRL3357, AF13, and Tox4) to H2O2-induced oxidative stress using an RNA sequencing approach. These isolates were cultured in an aflatoxin-production conducive medium amended with various levels of H2O2. Whole transcriptomes were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq platform with an average of 40.43 million filtered paired-end reads generated for each sample. The obtained transcriptomes were then used for differential expression, gene ontology, pathway, and co-expression analyses. Isolates which produced higher levels of aflatoxin tended to exhibit fewer differentially expressed genes than isolates with lower levels of production. Genes found to be differentially expressed in response to increasing oxidative stress included antioxidant enzymes, primary metabolism components, antibiosis-related genes, and secondary metabolite biosynthetic components specifically for aflatoxin, aflatrem, and kojic acid. The expression of fungal development-related genes including aminobenzoate degradation genes and conidiation regulators were found to be regulated in response to increasing stress. Aflatoxin biosynthetic genes and antioxidant enzyme genes were also found to be co-expressed and highly correlated with fungal biomass under stress. This suggests that these secondary metabolites may be produced as part of coordinated oxidative stress responses in A. flavus along with antioxidant enzyme gene expression and developmental regulation."

For the calculation of pesticide concentrations it is necessary to provide an application date which has to match the specific Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundesamt, Chemische Industrie (BBCH) stage at which the pesticide shall be applied. If these application dates are not available for a specific stage, crop and country they must be estimated, which adds an additional uncertainty to the predicted concentrations. In the present study, we therefore evaluate to which extent application dates can be derived from phenological data. For this analysis phenological data, converted to BBCH stages, of two field crops provided by the German Weather Service (DWD) were analyzed. We found a linear correlation between BBCH stages and the respective appearance dates, which can be used for interpolation of appearance dates of specific BBCH stages. Remarkably, when comparing BBCH stages from Germany and the Czech Republic almost identical correlations of appearance dates and BBCH stages were found. In the next step, soil and climate data from Joint Research Centre (JRC) were analyzed together with phenological data in order to evaluate if BBCH stages can be estimated for countries with other climate or soil conditions. This analysis revealed that temperature, global radiation and evaporation were the parameters with the strongest impact. These parameters were used for estimating appearance dates of BBCH stages for other countries. Exemplarily, appearance dates for maize BBCH were calculated for Italy. Estimated and observed appearance dates showed a high concordance (on average six days difference). Finally, the political of impact a variation of a few days on calculated pesticide concentration was analyzed.

A total of 169 feed samples were collected and analyzed for 20 mycotoxins using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry multimethod. Silage and compound feed were the main diet ingredients, representing on average 67 and 23% of dry matter intake, respectively. Deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone, roquefortine C, and mycophenolic acid were the mycotoxins with the highest incidence. The incidence of DON in silage, compound feed, and feed commodity samples was 38 to 54%. The incidence of zearalenone in silage, compound feed, and feed commodity samples was 17 to 38%. The DON and zearalenone had a low incidence in forage samples and were not detected in ensiled by-product samples. Roquefortine C and mycophenolic acid were only detected in silage and ensiled by-product samples (incidence 7 to 19%). Fumonisins B(1) and B(2) were detected in 2 compound feed samples and one feed commodity sample. Aflatoxins B(1), B(2), G(1), and G(2), ochratoxin A, T-2 and HT-2 toxin, 3-acetyl-DON, 15-acetyl-DON, diacetoxyscirpenol, sterigmatocystin, fusarenon-X, ergotamine, and penicillinic acid were not detected in any of the samples. Average concentrations of DON, zearalenone, roquefortine C, and mycophenolic acid in complete diets were 273, 28, 114, and 54 microg/kg, respectively. Maximum concentrations were 969, 203, 2,211, and 1,840 microg/kg, respectively. Calculated average daily intakes of these mycotoxins were 5.0, 0.5, 2.0, and 0.9 mg/animal, respectively, and maximum daily intakes 19.3, 3.5, 38.9, and 32.3 mg/animal, respectively. Corn silage was the major source of all 4 of these mycotoxins in the diet. Extremely high concentrations of roquefortine C and mycophenolic acid (up to 45 and 25 mg/kg, respectively) were detected in visibly molded areas in surface layers of corn silage. These areas appeared to be the main source of roquefortine C and mycophenolic acid in the diet.

Focal earthworm species were selected following a matrix of four steps: Identification of functional groups, categorization of non-target species, ranking species on ecological criteria, and final selection of focal species. They are recommended as appropriate non-target organisms to assess environmental risks of genetically modified (GM) crops; in this case maize and potatoes. In total, 44 literature sources on earthworms in arable cropping systems including maize or potato from Ireland, Sweden and Spain were collected, which present information on species diversity, individual density and specific relevance for soil functions. By means of condensed literature data, those species were identified which (i) play an important functional role in respective soil systems, (ii) are well adapted to the biogeographical regions, (iii) are expected to occur in high abundances under cultivation of maize or potato and (iv) fulfill the requirements for an ERA test system based on life-history traits. First, primary and secondary decomposers were identified as functional groups being exposed to the GM crops. In a second step, anecic and endogeic species were categorized as potential species.

Essential oils (EOs) have shown activities against various bacterial pathogens. However, EOs are water-insoluble and have unpleasant sensory properties, and strategies are needed to prepare colloidal systems for dispersion in liquid products and increase their antimicrobial activity and therefore reduce their usage level. In the present study, the overall objective was to fabricate and characterize self-emulsified nanoemulsions containing multiple EOs with synergistic antibacterial activities. Cinnamon, lemongrass, oregano, and tea tree EOs were observed to have synergistic antibacterial activities when used in combinations, especially for their triple combinations showing the fractional inhibitory concentration index of 0.625 and below. When triple EOs were emulsified by the combination of sunflower lecithin and Tween 20, mixing EOs with corn oil enabled the preparation of translucent oil-in-water nanoemulsions by simply stirring the mixtures. Three formulations were chosen for the preparation of self-emulsified nanoemulsions as these systems remained translucent, the droplet diameter remained to be smaller than 200¬†nm, and the polydispersity index remained to be smaller than 0.3 after 180-day ambient storage at 21¬†¬∞C. The oil: surfactant mass ratio in these nanoemulsions (1.16 or higher) was higher than that of EO microemulsions (up to 0.77) prepared with a similar method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the nanoemulsions remained to be 0.5 or 1.0¬†mg/mL against S. aureus, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) remained to be 1.0 or 2.0¬†mg/mL after the 180-day storage. A higher EO: surfactant mass ratio of nanoemulsions resulted in a lower MIC and MBC. When tested in whole milk with 3.3% fat at 21¬†¬∞C, no inhibition of S. aureus was observed for nanoemulsions at overall EO levels of 2.5 and 5.0¬†mg/mL; at an overall EO concentration of 7.5¬†mg/mL, no inhibition was observed for one nanoemulsion with the lowest EO:(corn oil + surfactant) mass ratio, while the gradual reduction of S. aureus by ~1 or 2 log CFU/mL in 120¬†h was observed for the other two nanoemulsions.

Recurring and increasing studies on AF ingestion incidents indicate that AF contamination is a serious food safety issue worldwide. Currently, immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC) has become the most conventional sample clean-up method for determining AFs in foodstuffs. However, the IAC method may be limited to some laboratories because it requires the use of expensive disposable cartridges and the IA procedure is time-consuming. Herein, to achieve the cost-effective determination of AFs in edible oils, we developed a dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) clean-up method based on humic acids (HAs), which is followed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. HAs could be directly used as a DSPE sorbent after simple treatment without any chemical modification. In the HA-DSPE, AFs could remain on the HA sorbent by both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, whereas the oil matrix was retained on HA via only hydrophobic interactions. The oil matrix could be sufficiently washed off by n-hexane, whereas the AFs could still be retained on HA; thus, the selective extraction of AFs and clean-up of oil matrices were achieved. Under the optimal conditions of HA-DSPE, satisfactory recoveries ranging from 81.3% to 106.2% for four AFs (B1, B2, G1, and G2) were achieved in various oil matrices i. e. blended oil, mixed olive oil, tea oil, sunflower seed oil, rapeseed oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, rice oil, corn oil, and peanut oil. Minor matrix effects ranging from 89.3% to 112.9% were obtained for the four AFs, which were acceptable. Moreover, the LODs of AFs between 0.063 and 0.102 Œºg kg-1 completely meet the regulatory levels fixed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Union (EU), China, or other countries. The proposed methodology was further validated using a naturally contaminated peanut oil, and the results indicated that the accuracy of the HA-DSPE could match the accuracy of the referenced IAC. In addition, HA-DSPE can be used to directly treat diluted edible oil without liquid-liquid extraction and HA is cheap and can be easily obtained from the market worldwide; these advantages make the proposed methodology simple, low-cost, and accessible for the determination of AFs in edible oils."

Human exposure to AFs can occur in utero, via breast milk, through weaning foods, and throughout an individual's lifetime. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to AFs in early life through diet is a contributing factor to immune suppression, micronutrient deficiency, possible vaccine interference, and impaired growth in children. However, these results remain inconsistent and inconclusive due to lack of randomized controlled studies. A randomized school-based cross-sectional study was designed to study AF exposure levels and associated health effects in children between ages 6 and 12‚Äâyears. Participants were recruited from primary schools within Siaya and Makueni Counties of Kenya, East Africa. The Joint Ethics Committee of the University of Nairobi and Kenyatta National Hospital in Kenya approved the research protocol and procedures for the study. Both parental consent and child assent were obtained before enrollment in the study. Parents were requested to provide household grain samples and fill out questionnaires detailing their sociodemographic information, household dietary patterns, farming practices, and knowledge of AF contamination. Blood samples were collected from children participants, and sera were prepared for analysis of AFB1-lysine which is one of the validated biomarkers for AF exposure. This protocol describes a school-based, cross-sectional study whose objective is to comparatively evaluate the role of AF exposure on adverse health outcomes in children. Specifically, effects of cumulative AF exposure on nutritional status, immune markers, and growth parameters will be assessed. This study is not a clinical trial, rather a cross-sectional study aimed at providing baseline data on AF exposures in children who live in presumably high versus low AF exposure regions.

The analysis also followed heavy metal detection in the subsequent irrigated soil and vegetables/crop plants in relation to assessment of health risk to the consumer to plan the future monitoring in this area. An unremitting boost of heavy metals into the environment from wastewater irrigation has become a global issue. These heavy metals enter the food chain and pose health assumptions to consumers upon utilization.

For wastewater samples, pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), and selected heavy metals such as Al, As, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn, and Ni were determined. The mean values of heavy metals in the soil samples were within the WHO/FAO safe limit, while Cr and Pb were the most frequent (100%) among the metals. However, differentiating the sites, the concentration of Cr and Cu, Ni, and Fe were elevated. The metal transfer was highly effective from soil to the growing plants i. e. brinjal, red corn, wheat, tomato, and spinach than other plant species.

However, frequency of outbreaks linked to the consumption of fresh or minimally processed food of nonanimal origin is increasing. New infection routes of S. enterica by vegetables, fruits, nuts, and herbs have to be considered. This leads to special interest in S. enterica interactions with leafy products, e. g. , salads, that are mainly consumed in a minimally processed form. The attachment of S. enterica to salad is a crucial step in contamination, but little is known about the bacterial factors required and mechanisms of adhesion.

We investigated the contributions of the various adhesive structures of STM to the initial event in transmission, i. e. , binding to the plant surface. A reductionist system was used that allowed experimentally controlled surface expression of individual adhesive structures and analyses of the contribution to binding to leave surfaces of corn salad under laboratory conditions. The model system allowed the determination of the relative contributions of fimbrial and nonfimbrial adhesins, the type 3 secretion systems, the O antigen of lipopolysaccharide, the flagella, and chemotaxis of STM to binding to corn salad leaves.

The use of D4 as a direct ingredient in personal care products has declined significantly over the past 20 years, although it may be present as a residual impurity in a variety of consumer products. D5 is still used as an intentional ingredient in cosmetics, consumer products and in dry cleaning. Persons who may be exposed include occupational exposure for workers, and potential inhalation or dermal exposure for consumers and the general public. Because of the diverse use, especially of D5, and the potential for human exposure, a comprehensive program was undertaken to understand the kinetics, metabolism, enzyme induction and toxicity of D4 and D5 in rats following relevant routes of exposure. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models utilizing these studies have been reported for D4 and D5 in the rat and human following dermal and inhalation exposures, with the oral uptake component of the model being limited in its description. Data from high dose oral studies in corn oil and simethicone vehicles and neat were used in the D4/D5 harmonized PBPK model development. It was uncertain if the inability to adequately describe the oral uptake was due to unrealistic high doses or unique aspects of the chemistry of D4/D5. Low dose studies were used to provide data to refine the description of oral uptake in the model by exploring the dose dependency and the impact of a more realistic food-like vehicle. Absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME) of D4 and D5 was determined following a single low oral gavage dose of 14C-D4 and 14C-D5 at 30 and 100mg/kg body weight (bw), respectively, in a rodent liquid diet. Comparison of the low vs. high dose oral gavage administration of D4 and D5 demonstrated dose-dependent kinetic behavior. Data and modeling results suggest differences in metabolism between low and high dose administration indicating high dose administration results in or approaches non-linear saturated metabolism. These low dose data sets were used to refine the D4/D5 multi-route harmonized PBPK model to allow for a better description of the disposition and toxicokinetics of D4/D5 following oral exposure. With a refined oral uptake description, the model could be used in risk assessment to better define the internal dose of D4 and D5 following exposure to D4 and D5 via multiple routes."

They directly or indirectly enter aquatic and terrestrial environments through application, accidental release, contaminated soil/sediments, or atmospheric fallouts. When present in excess, ZnO NPs can induce phytotoxicity and reduce plant growth and yields. ZnO NPs can also cause Zn accumulation in edible parts of food crops, and then subsequently enter human bodies and pose a significant health risk. Arbuscular mycorrhizae are ubiquitous symbiotic associations in nature formed between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and most higher plants in terrestrial ecosystems. In addition to their well-known contribution to plant nutrient acquisition and growth, AM fungi can improve plant tolerance to various environmental stresses, but mycorrhizal effects vary with environmental conditions such as phosphorus status in both soil and plants. AM fungi have been shown to alleviate the negative effects of ZnO NPs and zinc accumulation in plants, however, the role of phosphorus fertilization has been neglected. A greenhouse pot culture experiment was conducted using maize as the test plant inoculated with or without AM fungus Funneliformis mosseae. Four levels of phosphorus (0, 20, 50 or 100 mg¬∑kg-1) and two levels of ZnO NPs (0 or 500 mg¬∑kg-1) were applied to pots. Shoots and roots were harvested separately after two months of growth. Mycorrhizal infection, plant biomass, P and Zn concentrations and uptake in plants, and soil DTPA-extractable zinc and pH were determined. The results showed that ZnO NPs did not significantly affect the growth of maize, but inhibited root mycorrhizal infection and plant phosphorus uptake, and led to the accumulation of zinc in plants. ZnO NPs and high phosphorus supply decreased root mycorrhizal infection, but AM inoculation significantly promoted plant growth under all phosphorus supply levels. Phosphorus application and AM inoculation increased soil pH, but reduced the bioavailability of Zn derived from ZnO NPs, decreased the translocation and accumulation of zinc in maize shoots, and thus produced beneficial effects on plants. In general, AM inoculation showed positive mycorrhizal effect, especially under low phosphorus conditions and addition of ZnO NPs. Our results showed for the first time that both AM fungi and phosphate fertilizer could help to mitigate soil pollution and the ecological and health risks posed by ZnO NPs."

The heavy metal concentrations in crops were further detected, and the non-carcinogenic health risks in the study area were evaluated using the probabilistic risk assessment method, as to provide a theoretical basis for the treatment, prevention, and control of heavy metal pollution in farmland soil in Luancheng. According to the results, œâ(Cd), œâ(Cr), œâ(Cu), œâ(Pb), and œâ(Zn) in the soils were 0.06-1.08, 22.14-473.47, 12.83-150.74, 10.75-577.72, and 62.23-652.78 mg¬∑kg-1, which exceeded the standard with over-standard rates reaching 1.83%, 1.22%, 0.61%, 0.61%, and 1.22%, respectively.

The total non-carcinogenic health risks (TTHQ) to the human body caused by the consumption of heavy metals in corn grown in the study area were all less than 1, with no obvious negative effects, and TTHQ was higher than 1 in wheat, increasing the likelihood of negative impacts on the human body. With the influence of the distribution of pollution-related enterprises in the industrial zone, heavy metal concentrations were higher in the south, west, and middle directions of the study area. Among them, the study area soil was slightly contaminated by Cd (Level 1). Cd and Hg had a slight potential ecological risk (Level 2), whereas other heavy metals had low potential ecological risk (Level 1). In general, most of the surface cultivated soil was not obviously polluted by heavy metals in the study area. According to the PMF results and survey, we speculated that soil heavy metals mainly came from soil parent material (52.05%), artificial pollution sources (historical sewage irrigation and industrial manufacture) (32.98%), and atmospheric deposition (14.97%). To summarize, the study area should be divided into a priority protection category and safe utilization category. The input of pollution sources should be strictly controlled for the priority protection category, and alternative planting, rotating, and fallow should be implemented for the safe utilization category to reduce the risk of standard-exceeding agricultural products."

Oral exposure to biodiesels is a concern because of contact during refuelling, accidental ingestion and exposure through ground water contamination. Although biodiesels from various feedstock are in use commercially and experimentally, very little is known about their potential adverse effects and no data is available on their potential for ground water contamination. A study was performed on male rats following oral treatment with experimental biodiesels (dissolved in corn oil) derived from canola oil (Bio-C), soy oil (Bio-S) and fish oil (Bio-F), at 500 mg/kg body weight/day, 5 days per week, for 4 weeks. Separate groups of animals were treated with low sulfur diesel (LSD) for comparison purpose, and with corn oil alone to serve as control. The potential for ground water contamination by biodiesels was investigated by the preparation of water-accommodated fractions (WAF) followed by gas chromatographic analysis. WAF from Bio-F and Bio-S was found to have the highest level of dichloromethane extractable materials. Gas chromatographic analysis indicated that the extractable materials from biodiesels contained much higher proportion of C15-C30 materials than LSD. Increased liver weight was observed in animal treated with Bio-C, Bio-S and LSD and decreased thymus weight was found in those treated with Bio-S. Histopathological changes typical of male-rat specific hyaline-droplet nephropathy were detected in kidney tubules of animals treated with LSD, Bio-S and Bio-C. Mild adaptive changes were observed in thyroids of animals treated with LSD, Bio-S and Bio-F. Clinical chemical and biochemical changes were confined to Bio-S and LSD treated rats and included elevation in some hepatic phase-I and phase-II drug metabolizing enzymes and hepatic palmitoyl Co-A oxidase, and elevated urinary concentrations of ascorbic acid and albumin. At the given dose level of 500 mg/kg bw/day, the overall treatment-related effects of biodiesels and LSD are mild, and the severity of the treatment effects may be ranked as: LSD>Bio-S>Bio-C>Bio-F.

Sodium hypochlorite is currently the most widespread disinfectant used by fresh-cut industries. Neutral electrolyzed water (NEW) is a novel disinfection system that could represent an alternative to sodium hypochlorite. The aim of the study was to determine whether NEW could replace sodium hypochlorite in the fresh-cut produce industry. The effects of NEW, applied in different concentrations, at different treatment temperatures and for different times, in the reduction of the foodborne pathogens Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7 and against the spoilage bacterium Erwinia carotovora were tested in lettuce. Lettuce was artificially inoculated by dipping it in a suspension of the studied pathogens at 10(8), 10(7) or 10(5) cfu ml(-1), depending on the assay. The NEW treatment was always compared with washing with deionized water and with a standard hypochlorite treatment. The effect of inoculum size was also studied. Finally, the effect of NEW on the indigenous microbiota of different packaged fresh-cut products was also determined. The bactericidal activity of diluted NEW (containing approximately 50 ppm of free chlorine, pH 8.60) against E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, L. innocua and E. carotovora on lettuce was similar to that of chlorinated water (120 ppm of free chlorine) with reductions of 1-2 log units. There were generally no significant differences when treating lettuce with NEW for 1 and 3 min. Neither inoculation dose (10(7) or 10(5) cfu ml(-1)) influenced the bacterial reduction achieved. Treating fresh-cut lettuce, carrot, endive, corn salad and 'Four seasons' salad with NEW 1:5 (containing about 50 ppm of free chlorine) was equally effective as applying chlorinated water at 120 ppm. Microbial reduction depended on the vegetable tested: NEW and sodium hypochlorite treatments were more effective on carrot and endive than on iceberg lettuce, 'Four seasons' salad and corn salad. The reductions of indigenous microbiota were smaller than those obtained with the artificially inoculated bacteria tested (0.5-1.2 log reduction). NEW seems to be a promising disinfection method as it would allow to reduce the amount of free chlorine used for the disinfection of fresh-cut produce by the food industry, as the same microbial reduction as sodium hypochlorite is obtained. This would constitute a safer, 'in situ', and easier to handle way of ensuring food safety."

The results of those studies were often difficult to interpret, because only one GE plant was compared to one related non-GE control. In such a setting, effects of the Cry proteins cannot be distinguished from plant background effects, in particular when the test species is nutritionally stressed. In the present study, we tested the suitability of three different maize materials, i. e. , flour, leaves and pollen, from five diverse non-GE maize lines (including EXP 258, a breeding line that is closely related to a SmartStax Bt maize) as exclusive food sources for D. magna. The parameters recorded included survival, sublethal endpoints such as body size, number of moltings to first offspring, time to first offspring, number of individuals in first clutch, total number of clutches, total number of offspring, average number of offspring per clutch, and population measures such as net reproductive rate R0, generation time T and intrinsic rate of increase rm. The results showed that D. magna can survive, grow and reproduce when fed only maize materials, although the performance was poorer than when fed algae, which indicates nutritional stress. Large differences in life table and population parameters of D. magna were observed among the different maize lines. Our results suggest that confounding effects caused by nutritional stress and plant background might explain some of the conflicting results previously published on the effects of Bt crops on D. magna. Using 95% confidence intervals for the means of the five maize lines for all measured parameters of D. magna performance in our study, we captured the natural range of variation. This information is useful for the interpretation of observed differences in D. magna performance between a GE plant and its non-GE comparator as it helps judging whether observed effects are of biological relevance. If differences between a GE and comparator line are observed and their biological relevance needs to be assessed in future risk assessments of GE maize, 1) the data on natural variation of the different parameters generated by previous studies can be informative (e. g. data from our study for maize fed D. magna); 2) for additional experiments the inclusion of multiple unrelated non-GE comparators should be considered; In addition, it should be taken into account that nutritional stress can affect the outcome of the study."

In developing countries regulatory measures are either lacking or poorly enforced, due to food insecurity, resulting in an increased mycotoxin exposure. The lack and poor accessibility of effective and environmentally safe control methods have led to an increased interest in practical and biological alternatives to reduce fumonisin intake.

Pre-harvest approaches include breeding for resistant maize cultivars, introduction of biocontrol microorganisms, application of phenolic plant extracts, and expression of antifungal proteins and fumonisin degrading enzymes in transgenic maize cultivars.

These studies involved four maize lines with contrasting levels of resistance to Aspergillus flavus. The resistant lines had 7 to 14-fold greater infested ears than the susceptible lines. However, seed aflatoxin B 1 levels, in mock- or A. flavus -inoculated ears were consistent with maize genotype resistance to A. flavus. Further, the corn earworm-infested ears had greater levels of fumonisin content in seeds than uninfested ears, indicating that the insect may have vectored native Fusarium verticillioides inoculum.

In contrast, corn earworm was tolerant to fumonisin with no significant loss in mass even at 100 ppm, implicating the low seed aflatoxin content as a predominant factor for the prevalence of corn earworm infestation and the associated fumonisin contamination in A. flavus resistant lines. These results highlight the need for integrated strategies targeting mycotoxigenic fungi and their insect vectors to enhance the safety of crop commodities. Aspergillus and Fusarium spp. not only cause ear rots in maize leading to crop loss, they can also contaminate the grain with carcinogenic mycotoxins. Incorporation of genetic resistance into breeding lines is an ideal solution for mycotoxin mitigation. However, the goal is fraught by a major problem. Resistance for AF or FUM accumulation is quantitative and contributed by several loci with small effects. Our work reveals that host phenology (flowering time) and insect vector-mycotoxin interactions can further confound breeding efforts. A host genotype even with demonstrable resistance can become vulnerable due to seasonal variation in flowering time or an outbreak of chewing insects. Incorporation of resistance to a single mycotoxin accumulation and not pairing it with insect resistance may not adequately ensure food safety. Diverse strategies including host-induced silencing of genes essential for fungal and insect pest colonization and broad-spectrum biocontrol systems need to be considered for robust mycotoxin mitigation."

Bt-protected corn, cotton, and potato were introduced into the United States in 1995/1996 and grown on a total of approximately 10 million acres in 1997, 20 million acres in 1998, and 29 million acres globally in 1999. The extremely rapid adoption of these Bt-protected crops demonstrates the outstanding grower satisfaction of the performance and value of these products. These crops provide highly effective control of major insect pests such as the European corn borer, southwestern corn borer, tobacco budworm, cotton bollworm, pink bollworm, and Colorado potato beetle and reduce reliance on conventional chemical pesticides. They have provided notably higher yields in cotton and corn. The estimated total net savings to the grower using Bt-protected cotton in the United States was approximately $92 million in 1998. Other benefits of these crops include reduced levels of the fungal toxin fumonisin in corn and the opportunity for supplemental pest control by beneficial insects due to the reduced use of broad-spectrum insecticides. Insect resistance management plans are being implemented to ensure the prolonged effectiveness of these products. Extensive testing of Bt-protected crops has been conducted which establishes the safety of these products to humans, animals, and the environment. Acute, subchronic, and chronic toxicology studies conducted over the past 40 years establish the safety of the microbial Bt products, including their expressed insecticidal (Cry) proteins, which are fully approved for marketing. Mammalian toxicology and digestive fate studies, which have been conducted with the proteins produced in the currently approved Bt-protected plant products, have confirmed that these Cry proteins are nontoxic to humans and pose no significant concern for allergenicity. Food and feed derived from Bt-protected crops which have been fully approved by regulatory agencies have been shown to be substantially equivalent to the food and feed derived from conventional crops. Nontarget organisms exposed to high levels of Cry protein are virtually unaffected, except for certain insects that are closely related to the target pests. Because the Cry protein is contained within the plant (in microgram quantities), the potential for exposure to farm workers and nontarget organisms is extremely low. The Cry proteins produced in Bt-protected crops have been shown to rapidly degrade when crop residue is incorporated into the soil. Thus the environmental impact of these crops is negligible. The human and environmental safety of Bt-protected crops is further supported by the long history of safe use for Bt microbial pesticides around the world."

The sources and distribution of heavy metals in farmland soils were analyzed using Kriging spatial interpolation and principal component analysis, and the ecological risk was evaluated using the single factor index, comprehensive pollution index, and potential ecological risk index. The results showed that the surrounding farmland soils in the closed Manganese mining area presented serious pollution of Cd, Zn, As, and Mn, in which the average contents of the above heavy metals in the dry land soil in the polluted area were 6.22, 612.28, 37.72, and 1506.2 mg¬∑kg-1, respectively.

The principal component analysis showed that the sources of Cd, Mn, and Zn in the farmland soil were related to the manganese ore mining, whereas the source of As in the farmland soil might originate from agricultural activities. The pollution area was at a heavy pollution level, and the main pollution factors were Cd, Mn, and Zn. The Cd in the farmland soil could pose a strong potential ecological risk, but the rest of the heavy metals presented only a slight potential ecological risk. The content of Cr, Pb, and Cd in the crops in the study area exceeded the standard, and the exceeding standard rate was between 1.1% and 37.3%, where the average content of over-standard heavy metals in corn was higher than that in rice, and the average content of heavy metals in leafy vegetables was higher than that in root vegetables. The soil pollution degree of heavy metals could affect the accumulation ability of crops, and different crops had different accumulation abilities. For instance, leafy vegetables and root vegetables easily accumulated Cd and Zn; however, rice and corn separately enriched Cd and Cr, as well as Zn and Cu. The contents of heavy metals in dryland soils had a positive correlation with the content of heavy metals in corresponding crops.

Predicting the aflatoxin risk is challenging due to complex interactions of biotic and abiotic stress factors that govern and exacerbate the phenomenon. The goal of this study was to determine whether a drought index could be used to predict the risk for pre-harvest aflatoxin contamination in corn. Risk assessment was approached at: 1) field (plot) level with data obtained from an in-field controlled experiment (Mississippi study), and 2) state level, where corn fields were sampled at a county level (Georgia study). The data used for this study consisted of historical records on aflatoxin contamination collected over thirteen growing seasons from 2000 to 2011, 2013, and 2014‚ÄØat Mississippi State, Mississippi (1), and from random corn fields in 53 counties across Georgia between 1977 and 2004 (2). A controlled experiment was conducted at Mississippi with two soil types (a Leeper silty clay loam and a Myatt loam), and three commercial hybrids characterized by different susceptibility levels to aflatoxin contamination. The Agricultural Reference Index for Drought (ARID), a generic drought index for calculating drought on daily basis was evaluated as an aflatoxin risk prediction tool. Mid-silk day was selected to split each growing season into two time periods, which were further divided into positive and negative weeks representing weeks after and before mid-silk, respectively. Weekly ARID factors were calculated for all periods to evaluate the in-season alterations in aflatoxin risk. In both studies, multiple logistic regression models were used to predict aflatoxin risk as a function of the weekly ARID values. In Mississippi, risk level changes were additionally tested according to soil type and corn hybrid aflatoxin susceptibility. The United States Food and Drug Administration restricts corn grain consumption by humans and young animals if the contamination level is above 20‚ÄØŒºg/kg; thus, this threshold (20‚ÄØŒºg/kg) was selected to develop a binary dependent variable for the logistic model from the raw aflatoxin data. The results revealed that ARID might be used as a predictive tool to assess aflatoxin risk, soil type and hybrid susceptibility to aflatoxin contamination were statistically significant independent factors, and there are critical week windows during the growing season when changes in drought conditions affect the likelihood for aflatoxin contamination. These findings can be used to minimize risk by adapting site-specific management strategies such as triggering irrigation during critical risk weeks, selecting the most appropriate hybrid for a given site/location based on soil type, and determining optimum harvest date."

It is evident that plants are capable of tolerating, transporting, and assimilating iron cyanides. The objectives of this study were to investigate the influence of temperatures on the removal and bioaccumulation of two chemical forms of iron cyanides by maize seedlings. Maize (Zea mays L. var. ZN 304) seedlings were grown hydroponically and treated with ferro- or ferri-cyanide in solution for 5 days. Six different temperatures were tested ranging from 12 to 27 degrees C. Total cyanide in solution phase and plant tissues was analyzed spectrophotometrically. The temperature coefficient (Q (10)) was also determined for maize exposed to both iron cyanides. The dissociation of both iron cyanides to free cyanide in solution was below the detection limit. Maize seedlings showed a significantly higher removal potential for ferro-cyanide than ferri-cyanide at all treatment temperatures. Analysis of mass balance revealed that the majority of these iron cyanides taken up from the hydroponic solutions was assimilated by maize, and roots were the major sink for cyanide accumulation. The Q (10) values were determined for ferro- and ferri-cyanide to be 2.31 and 2.75, respectively. Due to the significant difference in the removal rate between the two species of iron cyanides by plant, the conversion of ferri- to ferro-cyanide in aqueous solution prior to uptake is unlikely. Compared to the treatments amended with ferro-cyanide, more cyanide was recovered in plant materials of maize when exposed to ferri-cyanide, implying that ferri-cyanide is less sensitive to degradation than ferro-cyanide. Although the velocity of botanical assimilation of ferro-cyanide was faster than that of ferri-cyanide at any of the treatment temperatures, the removal of ferri-cyanide by maize was more sensitive to changes in temperature than that of ferro-cyanide. Removal of both iron cyanides by maize seedlings was observed to be positive in response to temperatures. Changes in temperatures have a substantial influence on not only the uptake and assimilation of ferro- and ferri-cyanide by maize but also cyanide accumulation in plant tissues. As one of the crucial abiotic factors involved in phytoremediation, temperature shows a positive influence on the removal of iron cyanides by plants. Further investigation on the fate of ferro- and ferri-cyanide in plant tissues would have helped distinguish the differences in the botanical assimilation pathways between the two iron cyanides. The ability of maize to remove iron cyanides has important implications on the vegetation management of environmental contamination."

The purpose of this study was to analyze the content of several HMs in samples of soil, horse feed (hay, mixed feed, and bran), mare's milk, and manure to assess bioaccumulation and possible adverse effects on the bodies of horses. An additional purpose was to identify areas with acceptable conditions for obtaining environmentally safe horse breeding products in the agricultural zones of the Almaty region, Kazakhstan. Samples were obtained from two farms in the Almaty region in 2020 (spring, summer, and autumn). In total, 72 soil samples were analyzed, which were taken from the upper humus horizon to the depth of the arable layer. Eighty-six samples were taken from the feed of horses. Green feed was represented by perennial and annual grasses (alsike clover, Medicago sativa, sweet yellow clover, as well as pea and oat mix). Barley and wheat bran stored in the warehouses of the farm were sampled for the research as feed supplements. The mixed feed comprised components such as maize and sunflower. In addition, 46 samples of mare's milk and 28 samples of horse manure were collected. The HM analysis was performed in the laboratory of the Kazakh-Japanese Innovation Center. The residual amounts of HMs were determined using an absorption spectrometer with a voltammetric analyzer. The content of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and arsenic (As) in all the studied samples of soil, feed, mare's milk, and manure did not exceed the threshold limit values (TLVs), suggesting that the intake of these toxic elements into the human body with food was low. The average Cd concentration was in the range of 0.29-0.31 mg/kg in soil samples and in the range of 0.20-0.27 mg/kg in feed samples. In milk, the Cd concentration varied from 0.01 to 0.02 mg/L and was lower in summer and higher in fall. The total average Cd content in horse manure was 0.1844 mg/kg.

In a thorough and up-to-date evaluation of all the fossil energy costs of ethanol production from corn, every step in the production and conversion process must be included. In this study, 14 energy inputs in average U. S. corn production are included. Then, in the fermentation/distillation operation, 9 more identified fossil fuel inputs are included. Some energy and economic credits are given for the by-products, including dried distillers grains (DDG). Based on all the fossil energy inputs, a total of 1.43 kcal fossil energy is expended to produced 1 kcal ethanol. When the energy value of the DDG, based on the feed value of the DDG as compared to that of soybean meal, is considered, the energy cost of ethanol production is reduced slightly, to 1.28 kcal fossil energy input per 1 kcal ethanol produced. Several proethanol investigators have overlooked various energy inputs in U. S. corn production, including farm machinery, processing machinery, and the use of hybrid corn. In other studies, unrealistic, low energy costs were attributed to such inputs as nitrogen fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides. Controversy continues concerning the energy and economic credits that should be assigned to the by-products. The U. S. Department of Energy reports that 17.0 billion L ethanol was produced in 2005. This represents only less than 1% of total oil use in the U. S. These yields are based on using about 18% of total U. S. corn production and 18% of cornland. Because the production of ethanol requires large inputs of both oil and natural gas in production, the U. S. is importing both oil and natural gas to produce ethanol. Furthermore, the U. S. Government is spending about dollar 3 billion annually to subsidize ethanol production, a subsidy of dollar 0.79/L ethanol produced. With the subsidy, plus the cost of production, the cost of ethanol is calculated to be dollar 1.21/L. The subsidy for a liter of ethanol is 45-times greater than the subsidy per liter of gasoline. The environmental costs associated with producing ethanol are significant but have been ignored by most investigators in terms of energy and economics. The negative environmental impacts on cropland, and freshwater, as well as air pollution and public health, have yet to be carefully assessed. These environmental costs in terms of energy and economics should be calculated and included in future ethanol analyses. General concern has been expressed about taking 18% of U. S. corn, and more in the future, to produce ethanol for burning in automobiles instead of using the corn as food for the many malnourished people in the world.

The study focused on contamination of wheat with deoxynivalenol, and on abundance of Dinophysis spp. and the possible relationship with diarrhetic shellfish toxins. The study used currently available data and models. Global and regional climate models were combined with models of crop phenology, mycotoxin prediction models, hydrodynamic models and ecological models, with the output of one model being used as input for the other. In addition, statistical data analyses using existing national datasets from the study area were performed to obtain information on the relationships between Dinophysis spp. cell counts and contamination of shellfish with diarrhetic shellfish toxins as well as on frequency of cereal cropping. In this paper, a summary of the study is presented, and overall conclusions and recommendations are given. Climate change projections for the years 2031-2050 were used as the starting point of the analyses relative to a preceding 20-year baseline period from which the climate change signal was calculated. Results showed that, in general, climate change effects lead to advanced flowering and harvest of wheat, and increased risk of contamination of wheat with deoxynivalenol. Blooms of dinoflagellates were estimated to occur more often. If the group of Dinophysis spp. behaves similarly to other flagellates in the future then frequency of harmful algal blooms of Dinophysis spp. may also increase, but consequences for contamination of shellfish with diarrhetic shellfish toxins are uncertain. Climate change will also have indirect effects on toxin contamination, which may be equally important. For example, the frequency of cropping of wheat and maize in north Europe was projected to increase under climate change, which will also increase the risk of contamination of the grains with deoxynivalenol. Risk managers are encouraged to consider the entire range of the predictions of climate change effects on food safety hazards, rather than median or average values only. Furthermore, it is recommended to closely monitor levels of mycotoxins and marine biotoxins in the future, in particular related to risky situations associated with favourable climatic conditions for toxin producing organisms. In particular, it is important to pay attention to the continuity of collecting the right data, and the availability and accessibility of databases.

The biochar was applied to paddy soil at three rates (0, 0.7, and 2.1%, w/w), with or without N fertilization (0, 168, and 210 kg N ha-1). Pot experiments were performed to determine nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and 15N recovery from paddy soil using a 15N tracer across the rice growing season. Compared with the non-biochar control, biochar significantly decreased soil bulk density while increasing soil porosity, irrespective of pyrolysis temperature and N fertilizer level. Under B400 and B700, a high biochar rate decreased N loss rate to 66.42 and 68.90%, whereas a high N level increased it to 77.21 and 76.99%, respectively. Biochar also markedly decreased N2O emissions to 1.06 (B400) and 0.75 kg ha-1 (B700); low-N treatment caused a decrease in N2O emissions under B400, but this decrease was not observed under B700. An application rate of biochar of 2.1% plus 210 kg ha-1 N fertilizer substantially decreased the N fertilizer-induced N2O emission factor under B400, whereas under B700 no significant difference was observed. Biochar combined with N fertilizer treatment decreased rice biomass and grain yield by an average of 51.55 and 23.90 g pot-1, respectively, but the yield reduction under B700 was lower than under B400. Irrespective of pyrolysis temperature, biochar had a positive effect on residual soil 15N content, while it negatively affected the 15N recovery of rice, N2O emissions from soil, rice biomass, and grain yield in the first year. Generally, a high application rate of biochar prepared at high or low pyrolysis temperature reduced the N fertilizer-induced N2O emission factor considerably. These biochar effects were dependent on N fertilizer level, biochar application rate, and their interactions."

After the accident, an urgent soil cleaning up was carried out in some places. Seventeen years later, cereal (rice, maize, and sorghum), pulses (soybean, Adzuki bean, mung bean and peanut), vegetables (ipomoea, capsicum, taro and string bean) and the rooted soils were sampled at four sites: (1) the mining area (SZY), (2) the area still covered with the mining tailing spills (GYB), (3) the cleaned area from mining tailing spills (JTC), and (4) a background site (REF). Metal concentrations in the crops and soils were analyzed to evaluate the long-term effects of the spilled waste on the soil and the potential human exposure through food chains. The results showed that the physical-chemical properties of the soils obviously changed due to the different farming styles used by each individual farmer. Leaching effects and plant extraction of metals from some soils were quite weak. Certain soils were still heavily polluted with As, Cd, Zn, Pb and Cu. The contamination levels were in the order of GYB>SZY>JTC showing that the clean-up treatment was effective. The maximum allowable concentration (MAC) levels for Chinese agricultural soils were still highly exceeded, particularly for As and Cd (followed by Zn, Pb and Cu), with mean concentrations of 709 and 7.6 mg kg(-1), respectively. These concentrations exceed the MAC levels by 24 times for As and 13 times for Cd at GYB. Generally, the edible leaves or stems of crops were more heavily contaminated than seeds or fruits. Ipomoea was the most severely contaminated crop. The concentrations of Cd and Pb were 3.30 and 76.9 mg kg(-1) in ipomoea leaves at GYB, which exceeded the maximum permit levels (0.5 mg kg(-1) for Cd and 9 mg kg(-1) for Pb) by 6.6 and 8.5 times, respectively. Taro (+skin) could accumulate high concentrations of Zn and Cd in the edible stem, and rice and capsicum had high Cd concentration in the edible parts. However, the toxic element concentrations in maize, sorghum, Adzuki bean, soybean and mung bean remained lower than the threshold levels. The bio-accumulation factors (BAFs) of crops were in the order: Cd>Zn>Cu>Pb>As. BAF was typically lower in the edible seeds or fruits than in stems and leaves. The accumulation effect strongly depends on the crop's physiological properties, the mobility, of the metals, and the availability of metals in soils but not entirely on the total element concentrations in the soils. Even so, the estimated daily intake amount of Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb from the crops grown in the affected three sites and arsenic at SZY and GYB exceeded the RDA (Recommended dietary allowance) levels. Subsequently, the crops grown in Chenzhou Pb/Zn mine waste affected area might have a hazardous effect on the consumer's health. This area still needs effective measures to cure the As, Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu contamination."

A current example is the use of the insecticidal Cry proteins from the bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), to improve crops, known as Bt crops, by reducing injury from various crop pests. The adoption of genetically modified (GM) crops has increased dramatically in the last 11 years. However, the introduction of GM plants into agricultural ecosystems has raised a number of questions, including the ecological impact of these plants on soil ecosystems. Crop residues are the primary source of carbon in soil, and root exudates govern which organisms reside in the rhizosphere. Therefore, any change to the quality of crop residues and rhizosphere inputs could modify the dynamics of the composition and activity of organisms in soil. Insect-resistant Bt crops have the potential to change the microbial dynamics, biodiversity, and essential ecosystem functions in soil, because they usually produce insecticidal Cry proteins through all parts of the plant. It is crucial that risk assessment studies on the commercial use of Bt crops consider the impacts on organisms in soil. In general, few or no toxic effects of Cry proteins on woodlice, collembolans, mites, earthworms, nematodes, protozoa, and the activity of various enzymes in soil have been reported. Although some effects, ranging from no effect to minor and significant effects, of Bt plants on microbial communities in soil have been reported, using both culturing and molecular techniques, they were mostly the result of differences in geography, temperature, plant variety, and soil type and, in general, were transient and not related to the presence of the Cry proteins. The respiration (i. e. , CO2 evolution) of soils cultivated with Bt maize or amended with biomass of Bt maize and other Bt crops was generally lower than from soils cultivated with or amended with biomass of the respective non-Bt isolines, which may have been a result of differences in chemical composition (e. g. , the content of starch, soluble N, proteins, carbohydrates, lignin) between Bt plants and their near-isogenic counterparts. Laboratory and field studies have shown differences in the persistence of the Cry proteins in soil, which appear to be the result primarily of differences in microbial activity, which, in turn, is dependent on soil type (e. g. , pH, clay mineral composition, other physicochemical characteristics), season (e. g. , temperature, water tension), crop species (e. g. , chemical composition, C:N ratio, plant part), crop management practices (e. g. , till vs. no-till), and other environmental factors that vary with location and climate zones. This review discusses the available data on the effects of Cry proteins on below-ground organisms, the fate of these proteins in soil, the techniques and indicators that are available to study these aspects, and future directions."

Since the late 1970s, the volume of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) applied has increased approximately 100-fold. Further increases in the volume applied are likely due to more and higher rates of application in response to the widespread emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds and new, pre-harvest, dessicant use patterns. GBHs were developed to replace or reduce reliance on herbicides causing well-documented problems associated with drift and crop damage, slipping efficacy, and human health risks. Initial industry toxicity testing suggested that GBHs posed relatively low risks to non-target species, including mammals, leading regulatory authorities worldwide to set high acceptable exposure limits. To accommodate changes in GBH use patterns associated with genetically engineered, herbicide-tolerant crops, regulators have dramatically increased tolerance levels in maize, oilseed (soybeans and canola), and alfalfa crops and related livestock feeds. Animal and epidemiology studies published in the last decade, however, point to the need for a fresh look at glyphosate toxicity. Furthermore, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer recently concluded that glyphosate is ""probably carcinogenic to humans. "" In response to changing GBH use patterns and advances in scientific understanding of their potential hazards, we have produced a Statement of Concern drawing on emerging science relevant to the safety of GBHs. Our Statement of Concern considers current published literature describing GBH uses, mechanisms of action, toxicity in laboratory animals, and epidemiological studies. It also examines the derivation of current human safety standards. We conclude that: (1) GBHs are the most heavily applied herbicide in the world and usage continues to rise; (2) Worldwide, GBHs often contaminate drinking water sources, precipitation, and air, especially in agricultural regions; (3) The half-life of glyphosate in water and soil is longer than previously recognized; (4) Glyphosate and its metabolites are widely present in the global soybean supply; (5) Human exposures to GBHs are rising; (6) Glyphosate is now authoritatively classified as a probable human carcinogen; (7) Regulatory estimates of tolerable daily intakes for glyphosate in the United States and European Union are based on outdated science. We offer a series of recommendations related to the need for new investments in epidemiological studies, biomonitoring, and toxicology studies that draw on the principles of endocrinology to determine whether the effects of GBHs are due to endocrine disrupting activities. We suggest that common commercial formulations of GBHs should be prioritized for inclusion in government-led toxicology testing programs such as the U. S. National Toxicology Program, as well as for biomonitoring as conducted by the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

Presently, oat represents only ~1.3% of the total world grain production, and its production system is fragmented. Nonetheless, current interest is growing because of recent knowledge on its potential benefits in food, feed and agriculture. This perspective will serve as a further impetus, with special focus on the recently valued advantages of oats in human food and health. Five approved European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) health claims apply to oats. Four relate to the oat-specific soluble fibres, the beta-glucans, and concern the maintenance and reduction of blood cholesterol, better blood glucose balance and increased faecal bulk. The fifth claim concerns the high content of unsaturated fatty acids, especially present in the endosperm, which reduces the risks of heart and vascular diseases. Furthermore, oat starch has a low glycemic index, which is favourable for weight control. Oat-specific polyphenols and avenanthramides have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, oats can contribute significantly to the presently recommended whole-grain diet. Next to globulins, oats contain a small fraction of prolamin storage proteins, called 'avenins', but at a much lower quantity than gluten proteins in wheat, barley and rye. Oat avenins do not contain any of the known coeliac disease epitopes from gluten of wheat, barley and rye. Long-term food studies confirm the safety of oats for coeliac disease patients and the positive health effects of oat products in a gluten-free diet. These effects are general and independent of oat varieties. In the EU (since 2009), the USA (since 2013) and Canada (since 2015) oat products may be sold as gluten-free provided that any gluten contamination level is below 20ppm. Oats are, however, generally not gluten-free when produced in a conventional production chain, because of regular contamination with wheat, barley or rye. Therefore, establishing a separate gluten-free oat production chain requires controlling all steps in the chain; the strict conditions will be discussed. Genomic tools, including a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker array and a dense genetic map, have recently been developed and will support marker-assisted breeding. In 2015, the Oat Global initiative emerged enabling a world-wide cooperation starting with a data sharing facility on genotypic, metabolic and phenotypic characteristics. Further, the EU project TRAFOON (Traditional Food Networks) facilitated the transfer of knowledge to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to stimulate innovations in oat production, processing, products and marketing, among others with regard to gluten-free. Finally, with focus on counteracting market fragmentation of the global oat market and production chains, interactive innovation strategies between customers (consumers) and companies through co-creation are discussed."

On the other hand, these pesticides are a double-edged sword because they have both acute effects and chronic adverse effects on human health. The widespread use of pesticides has led to their persistence in soil, water, and agricultural products, thus posing a serious threat to public health. Therefore, the removal and analysis of pesticides are critical to protecting human safety and health. When removing pesticides from the environment, it is imperative to ensure high removal efficiency while preventing secondary pollution to the environment. Because of the low concentrations of pesticide residue in the environment, complex matrix, and large throughput of pesticide residue analysis, a low-cost fast pre-treatment technique that has strong selectivity and an enrichment effect on the target pesticide residue, with little environmental impact, is required. Plant biomass-derived biochar is obtained from wheat straw, corn cob, rice husk, etc. This material has a large specific surface area, high pore capacity, tunable surface functional groups, and good environmental compatibility, which make it an inexpensive and efficient adsorbent. Hence, there is a need to systematically review the knowledge regarding the application of plant-based biochar on pesticide removal and pesticide residue analysis. This paper reviews the application progress of plant biomass-derived biochar in the above mentioned two areas over the last decade. The pesticide removal applications include reducing the mobility of pesticides in soil, eliminating the pollution caused by chiral pesticides, loading pesticide-degrading bacteria, and releasing fertilizers sustainably when removing pesticide. As mentioned above, plant biomass-derived biochar has a large specific surface area, a high number of functional groups on the surface, and good environmental compatibility. Therefore, it can effectively remove pesticides or their metabolites from the environment without causing any secondary pollution. During pre-treatment, plan biomass-derived biochar is used as an adsorbent for dispersive solid-phase extraction, solid-phase microextraction, and magnetic solid-phase extraction to selectively adsorb organophosphorus and triazole pesticides in fruits and vegetables, as well as organochlorine pesticides in the aquatic environment. This paper also introduces the adsorption mechanism of plant biomass-derived biochar, where studies based on computational simulations such as the density functional theory, molecular dynamics simulation, and giant canonical Monte Carlo simulation are carefully discussed. The benefits of adopting computational simulations are also mentioned. Finally, this paper summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of using plant biomass-derived biochar in pesticide removal and pre-treatment, as well as the future research trends in this area."

This has been attributed to several biological (e. g. hepatitis B and C virus infection) and environmental factors (e. g. aflatoxin, AF). Other factors such as cigarette smoking, occupational exposure to chemicals such as pesticides, and endemic infections in the community, such as schistosomiasis, may have additional roles in the etiology or progression of the disease. Estimates of the burden of cancer caused by these factors provide an opportunity for prevention. Previously, there was strong evidence that hepatitis B virus (HBV) was the major cause of HCC in Egypt, but more recently HCV has become the predominant factor associated with the more recent epidemic of HCC. It has been well documented that Egypt has one of the highest prevalence rates of HCV infection in the world. The natural history of HCV infection and disease progression, however, are influenced by additional factors such as duration of infection, age at infection, sex, co-infection with HBV, the level of HCV viraemia and its genotype. The role of exposure to aflatoxins and development of HCC in Egypt was historically less clear. Nevertheless, recent food sampling surveys and population-based studies indicated that exposure to aflatoxins in Egypt may have been underestimated in the past. Recent results indicated that both local and imported samples were positive for aflatoxin B1 (AFB1, 17.5% and 20%, respectively), with concentrations ranging from 3 to 25 microg/kg. The level of AFB1 was dependent on the area of collection as well as the season of the year. In a population-based study, the level and frequency of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1, a major metabolite of aflatoxin B1 excreted in breast milk) was assessed as a biomarker of maternal exposure. The samples were collected from a selected group of 388 Egyptian lactating mothers during May-September 2003. Non-working status, obesity, high corn oil consumption, and the number of offspring contributed to the variability in occurrence of AFM1 in breast milk. Prevention and intervention approaches directed to risk factors of HCC can play a critical role in its prevention. In the case of HCV infection a prevention programme can be achieved by changing personal behaviors and/or cultural habits which are risk factors for HCV transmission, such as injection with contaminated syringes, blood transfusion, surgical operations, venous catheterization, use of common syringes, dental treatment and circumcision at home. Prevention of exposure to aflatoxins can be achieved either at community (via good agriculture practices) or individual levels (treatment or dietary interventions). In conclusion, due to the alarming increase in the incidence of HCC in Egypt, there is a need to further investigate the contribution of these emerging risk factors to the development of HCC in Egypt. This may enable us to determine the susceptibility to HCC among high-risk groups and to provide these individuals with effective measures for early prevention or intervention."

Aflatoxicosis is a serious problem in developing countries with environmental conditions appropriate for the biosynthesis of AFB1 byAspergillus flavus andAspergillus parasiticus. In Africa, especially in Ghana and Nigeria, there is a very high risk of liver cancer which is caused by the consumption of AFB1-intoxicated, traditionally fermented maize and sorghum products. It is suggested that one way to diminish this health risk might be the reduction of the AFB1 concentration in foods by bacteria. Especially bacteria used for food fermentation processes are of great importance, with a special emphasis on lactic acid bacteria which are involved in traditionally fermented African foods based on maize and sorghum. Most publications dealing with aflatoxin degradation by microorganisms describe a phosphate buffer test system for the performance of degradation experiments. In contrast to that, a test system based on physiological active bacterial and yeast cells has been developed, to assess food fermentation organisms for their ability to reduce the AFB1 concentration in vitro. The aflatoxin B1 concentration in test samples was quatitatively determined by HPLC. The assessment of lactic acid bacteria originating from different German and other European culture collections only showed a very slight reduction of the AFB1 concentration from 3% to 12%. Screening experiments in which other bacterial genera and lactic acid bacteria, isolated from different African foods have been assessed, in most cases showed the same results. However, some bacterial strains, e. g. strains of the genusBacillus derived from European culture collections and strains of the genusLactobacillus isolated from African foods, caused a release of AFB1 which was chemically bound before to components of the test medium and which therefore could not be extracted with chloroform. A process quite similar to that may happen during food fermentations. Different experiments showed that e. g. cellulose can bind AFB1 very effectively. Cellulose and different other food components are well known to absorb AFB1. During fermentation the cellulose and other AFB1-absorbing components may be degraded and the AFB1 will be released again. The only bacterial strain known as yet which is able to reduce the AFB1 concentration in vitro and in different food comodities isNocardia corynebacteroides (formerFlavobacterium aurantiacum). Nevertheless the mechanism of this AFB1 reduction is actually not well understood, it still has to be investigated. In the meantime several other bacterial strains, presumably from the taxonomic group of theActinomycetes could be proved to be effective reducers of the AFB1 concentration in our in vitro test system. Because as yet no food relevant microorganism could be found, which is able to degrade AFB1, these new strains in general offer the possibility for a genetic modification of food relevant microorganisms. This seems to be the way to come to starter cultures which are able to degrade AFB1 during food fermentations."

Results Sixty three 63/81 (78%) samples were contaminated with total aflatoxin (TAFs) ranging from LOD to 161.32 ppb, mean of 25.89‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ3.3 ppb which was significantly higher than the tolerable WHO/TBS limit of 15ppb total aflatoxins (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.002), Level of AFB1 in concentrate feed was ranged from LOD to 133.17 ppb, mean 18.87‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ2.45 ppb and was significantly higher than the tolerable WHO/TBS limit 10 ppb for AFB1 (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001). The level of AFB2 was ranged from LOD to 8.21 ppb, mean 1.82‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.27 ppb, AFG1 (LOD to 75.06 ppb, mean 7.75‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ2.32 ppb) and AFG2 (LOD to 7.87 ppb, mean, 1.30‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.350 ppb), among aflatoxin the level of contamination was AFB1‚Äâ>‚ÄâAFG1‚Äâ>‚ÄâAFB2‚Äâ>‚ÄâAFG2, however, AFB2 and AFG2 had significant same level of contamination (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.518). The samples collected from Temeke and Ilala were significant highly contaminated with aflatoxin than the WHO/TBS recommended limit (15 ppb), with TAFs of 33.63‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ3.96 ppb, p-value‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.00015, 30.78 ¬±, 7.05 ppb, p-value‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.034 respectively, while those from Kinondoni and Ubungo were not significantly higher than the recommended standard 15ppb (p-value, 0.71,0.742) respectively. The level of awareness was 38% and not significant (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.353) and 58/81 (72%) of respondents were not aware of the negative health effect of aflatoxins. The poor storage facility, poor handling practices, temperature, humidity and lack of awareness were the predominant factors identified to contribute a high level of aflatoxin contamination. Conclusions The results indicated that the concentrate feeds had aflatoxin concentrations which may pose risk to animals and/or human beings, economic losses due to increased cost of treatment and reduced cattle production. The use of improved pre and post-harvest management technologies, and awareness creation to animal feed value chain actors are important steps in the reduction of this problem."

In China, the BB emission has changed substantially over the past decades while the multi-year variation held high uncertainty and the driving forces have addressed little attention. Here, this research aimed to conduct a comprehensive and systematic analysis of BB variation in China and provided precise and targeted BB emission reduction suggestions. The moving of high emission for BB from 2003 to 2014 was clearly identified, by the view of reliable emission estimation and anthropogenic impacts. Multiple satellite products, field survey, time varying biomass loading data and measured emission factors were adopted to better estimating BB emission and reducing the uncertainty. Social-economic analysis was added to assess the anthropogenic impacts on high emission variation quantitatively. Results showed that the cumulative BB emissions of OC, EC, CH4, NOX, NMVOC, SO2, NH3, CO, CO2, PM2.5 and PM10 during 2003-2014 were 1.6¬†√ó¬†104, 5.64¬†√ó¬†103, 3.57¬†√ó¬†104, 1.7¬†√ó¬†104, 5.44¬†√ó¬†104, 2.96¬†√ó¬†103, 6.77¬†√ó¬†103, 6.5¬†√ó¬†105, 1.15¬†√ó¬†107, 5.26¬†√ó¬†104 and 6.04¬†√ó¬†104 Gg, respectively. Crop straw burning (in-field and domestic) in northeast China plain (NEP), north China plain (NCP), northern arid and semiarid region and loess plateau were the key sources, averagely contributed 73% for all the pollutants emission. While domestic straw burning and firewood burning in Sichuan basin (SB), Yunnan-Guizhou plateau and southern China were main contributors, averagely accounting for 70% of all the pollutants emission. On regional level, high emissions were mainly found in SB, NCP and NEP. Temporally, high emissions were mainly found in crop sowing harvesting and heating seasons. From 2003 to 2014, the BB emission for different biomass species has changed significantly in different regions. High emission has gradually moved from SB to NCP and NEP. Firewood burning and domestic straw burning emission decreased by 47% and 14% in SB, respectively. In-field straw burning emission increased by 52% and 231% in NCP and NEP respectively and domestic straw burning emission increased by 62% in NEP. Emissions from heating season have decreased while emissions in corn harvest season were continuously increased. Analysis of Environmental kuznets curve, agricultural productivity level, human burning habits, rural energy structure and local control policies revealed the internal human driving strength of the variation for BB emission. The unbalanced development of social economy and the policy bias were primary drivers of limiting the BB management. BB emission will alleviate in NCP and aggravate in NEP. For the further emission reduction, effective measures for corn sources management, straw returning and rural energy utilization should be systematically considered. This research provides a clear evidence for the multi-year variation pattern of BB emissions, which is critical for pollution prediction, air quality modeling and targeted mitigation strategies for the key regions of China."

Therefore, an empty dictionary is returned.</s>","The Republic of Haiti is a developing country in the Caribbean region with a history that challenges toxicologists, yet the historical panoply of toxicological hazards in Haiti has received little scholarly attention. The primary objectives of this paper are to review what is known about Haiti's current toxicological hazards, with a focus on chronic food-borne aflatoxin exposure and heavy metal contamination of water resources, and to compare these with previous large-scale, acute exposures to toxic substances: the 1995-1996 diethylene glycol (DEG) intoxications and the 2000-2001 ackee fruit poisonings. MEDLINE/PUBMED and the library website of Cornell University were searched using the terms ""Haiti"" and either ""heavy metals,"" ""aflatoxin"", ""diethylene glycol"", or ""ackee"". The search was inclusive of articles from 1950 to 2012, and 15 out of the 37 returned were peer-reviewed articles offering original data or comprehensive discussion. One peer-reviewed article in press, two newspaper articles, two personal communications, and one book chapter from the personal databases of the authors were also referenced, making a total of 21 citations. Elevated concentrations of aflatoxins (greater than 20 Œºg/kg) were documented for staples of the Haitian food supply, most notably peanut butters and maize. Human exposure to aflatoxin was confirmed with analysis of aflatoxin blood biomarkers. The implications of aflatoxin exposure were reviewed in the light of Haiti's age-adjusted liver cancer risk - the highest in the Caribbean region. Measurement of heavy metals in Port-au-Prince ground water showed contamination of lead and chromium in excess of the US Environmental Protection Agency's 15 Œºg/L Action Level for lead and 100 Œºg/L Maximum Contamination Level Goal for total chromium. The DEG contamination of paracetamol (acetaminophen) containing products in 1995-1996 claimed the lives of 109 children and the 2000-2001 epidemic of ackee fruit poisoning resulted in 60 cases of intoxication. Lessons for the Haitian Government. The DEG and ackee epidemics overwhelmed local Haitian public health resources. Yet, periods of 8 and 4 months, respectively, passed before the Haitian government sought assistance following the initial poisonings. To our knowledge, the Haitian government did not enact policy to promote drug safety and prevent future poisonings. This will not likely change in the near future because of the state's finance and personnel crises. While protection of its people remains the prerogative of the Haitian government, it is extremely limited in managing chemical exposure to environmental toxins, including aflatoxin and heavy metals. The cases of DEG and ackee fruit poisoning demonstrate that environmental exposures to chemicals have occurred in Haiti. Current low-level exposures to aflatoxin and heavy metals highlight the risk that large-scale poisonings can occur. While awareness of toxicological hazards in Haiti must be acknowledged more widely within the government and non-governmental sectors, the lessons of these exposures are relevant to all developing countries where the capacity to discern and manage toxicological risks is absent or not yet effective."

Drought-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to stimulate aflatoxin production and regulate development in Aspergillus flavus , and may function in signaling with host plants. Here, we have performed global, untargeted metabolomics to better understand the role of aflatoxin production in oxidative stress responses, and also explore isolate-specific oxidative stress responses over time. Two field isolates of A. flavus , AF13 and NRRL3357, possessing high and moderate aflatoxin production, respectively, were cultured in medium with and without supplementation with 15mM H 2 O 2 , and mycelia were collected following 4 and 7 days in culture for global metabolomics. Overall, 389 compounds were described in the analysis which were examined for differential accumulation. Significant differences were observed in both isolates in response to oxidative stress and when comparing sampling time points. The moderate aflatoxin-producing isolate, NRRL3357, showed extensive stimulation of antioxidant mechanisms and pathways including polyamines metabolism, glutathione metabolism, TCA cycle, and lipid metabolism while the highly aflatoxigenic isolate, AF13, showed a less vigorous response to stress. Carbohydrate pathway levels also imply that carbohydrate repression and starvation may influence metabolite accumulation at the later timepoint. Higher conidial oxidative stress tolerance and antioxidant capacity in AF13 compared to NRRL3357, inferred from their metabolomic profiles and growth curves over time, may be connected to aflatoxin production capability and aflatoxin-related antioxidant accumulation. The coincidence of several of the detected metabolites in H 2 O 2 -stressed A. flavus and drought-stressed hosts suggests their potential role in the interaction between these organisms and their use as markers/targets to enhance host resistance through biomarker selection or genetic engineering. Aspergillus flavus is a fungal pathogen of several important crops including maize and peanut. This pathogen produces carcinogenic mycotoxins known as aflatoxins during infection of plant materials, and is particularly severe under drought stress conditions. This results in significant losses in crop value and poses a threat to food safety and security globally. To combat this, understanding how this fungus responds to environmental stresses related to drought can allow us to identify novel methods of mitigating aflatoxin contamination. Here, we analyzed the accumulation of a broad series of metabolites over time in two isolates of A. flavus with differing stress tolerance and aflatoxin production capabilities in response to drought-related oxidative stress. We identified several metabolites and mechanisms in A. flavus which allow it to cope with environmental oxidative stress and may influence aflatoxin production and fungal growth. These may serve as potential targets for selection in breeding programs for the development of new cultivars, or for alteration using genetic engineering approaches to mitigate excessive aflatoxin contamination under drought stress."

The group of carcinogenic N-nitrosamines is of especially dangerous. It is worth mentioning that currently there are no standards for their content in Vietnam. Therefore, to ensure the chemical safety of infant food, it is necessary to improve the control system, including the development of modern technical and methodological base. The aim of the research is the comparative assessment of contamination with highly toxic, N-nitrosoamines of baby canned meat and vegetable products by the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using an automatic solid-phase extraction system and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Material and methods. The objects of research were homogenized canned meat-vegetable products for baby nutrition - 21 samples taken from the distribution network of the Republic of Vietnam: vegetables and rice with chicken (sample No. 1); sweet corn with mashed potatoes and turkey (sample No. 2); potatoes with veal (sample No. 3); each species has 7 samples. Each food sample was analyzed thrice by two methods. At the Federal Center of Perm, the screening studies of canned foods were performed using GC/ MS with application of the automatic solid-phase extraction system (SPE) after distillation using alkaline catalysis at the sample preparation stage. At the National Institute of Food Control of Republic of Vi–µtnam, canned samples were studied using GC-MS/MS. The extraction method was developed on the base of QuEChERS-approach. Results and discussion. During the research, the following chemical contaminants were found in the canned samples: N-nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosodiethylamine, N-methylethyl nitrosoamine, N-dipropylnitrosoamine, N-dibutyl nitrosoamine, N-piperidinitrozoamine, N-pyrrolidinin nitrosoamine, N-morpholinithrosamine and N-diphenyl nitrosoamine. It was demonstrated that the results of quantitative determination of the content of N-nitrosoamines in canned meat of Vietnam producers obtained in different laboratories are comparable and have good validation characteristics for the determination of N-nitrosoamines in baby food. Thus, N-nitrosodimethylamine was detected by both methods in all analyzed samples in the concentration range from 0.00045 to 0.00077 mg/kg. Values exceeding the maximum permissible level of N-nitrosoamines (N-nitrosodimethylamine and N-nitrosodiethylamine) in canned meat and vegetable samples (0.001 mg/kg according to Technical Regulations of the Customs Union TR TC 021/ 2011 ""On Food Safety"") were not found. The application of low-resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and the use of an automatic SPE system made it possible to achieve high comparability of the results in chemical analysis of N-nitrosoamines in canned products obtained in the laboratory of the Center and the National Institute for Food Control of Vietnam. Conclusion. The executed studies indicate the need for further monitoring of the content of chemicals in baby products in order to justify methodological approaches to the analysis of the risk of the simultaneous effect of chemical contaminants on the health of children. In this regard, it seems extremely important and relevant issue of hygienic regulation of the content of the studied compounds in products for baby food."

However, these models did not characterize the likelihood of virus survival under various time and temperature processes that feed ingredients undergo before they are added to swine diets. Here, we developed a quantitative risk assessment model to estimate the probability that one or more corn or soybean meal ocean vessels (25,000 tonnes) contaminated with ASFV would be imported into the United States annually. This final probability estimate was conditionally based on five likelihoods: the probability of initial ASFV contamination (p0), ASFV inactivation during processing (p1) and transport (p2), recontamination (pR), and ASFV inactivation while awaiting customs clearance at United States entry (p3). The probability of ASFV inactivation was modelled using corn and soybean (extruded or solvent extracted) processing conditions (times and temperatures), D-values (time to reduce 90% or 1-log) estimated from studies of ASFV thermal inactivation in pork serum (p1), and survival in feed ingredients during transoceanic transport (p2 and p3). 'What-if' scenarios using deterministic values for p0 and pR (1%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) were used to explore their impact on risk. The model estimated complete inactivation of ASFV after extrusion or solvent extraction processes regardless of the initial ASFV contamination probability assumed. The value of recontamination (ranging from 1% to 75%) was highly influential on the risk of one ASFV-contaminated soybean meal vessel entering the United States. Median risk estimates ranged from 0.064% [0.006%-0.60%; 95% probability interval (PI)], assuming a pR of 1.0%, up to 4.67% (0.45%-36.50% 95% PI) assuming a pR of 75.0%. This means that at least one vessel with ASFV-contaminated soybean meal would be imported once every 1563-21 years, respectively. When all raw corn was assumed to be contaminated (p0¬†=¬†100%), and no recontamination was assumed to occur (pR¬†=¬†0%), the median probability of one vessel with ASFV-contaminated corn entering the United States was 2.02% (0.28%-9.43% 95% PI) or once every 50 years. Values of recontamination between 1% and 75% did not substantially change the risk of corn. Days of transport, virus survival during transport (D-value), and number of vessels shipped were the parameters most influential for increased likelihood of a vessel with ASFV-contaminated soybean meal or corn entering the United States. The model helped to identify knowledge gaps that are most influential on output values and serves as a framework that could be updated and parameterized as new scientific information becomes available. We propose that the quantitative risk assessment model developed in this study can be used as a framework for estimating the risk of ASFV entry into the United States and other ASFV-free countries through other types of imported feed ingredients that may potentially become contaminated. Ultimately, this model can be used to develop risk mitigation strategies and critical control points for inactivating ASFV during feed ingredient processing, storage, and transport, and contribute to the design and implementation of biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction of ASFV into the United States and other ASFV-free countries."

However, application of TWW on agricultural land might be an effective and sustainable strategy in arid and semi-arid countries where fresh water resources are under great pressure, as long as potential harmful effects on the environment including soil, plants, and fresh water resources, and health risks to humans are minimized. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of deep emitters on limiting potential heavy metal accumulation in soils and grains, and health risk under drip irrigation with treated municipal wastewater. A field experiment was conducted according to a split block design with two treatments (fresh and wastewater) and three sub-treatments (0, 15, and 30¬†cm depth of emitters) in four replicates on a sandy loam Calcic Argigypsids, in Esfahan, Iran. The annual rainfall is about 123¬†mm, mean annual ETo is 1457¬†mm, and the elevation is 1590¬†m above sea level. A two-crop rotation of wheat (Triticum spp. ) and corn (Zea mays) was established on each plot with wheat growing from February to June and corn from July to September. Soil samples were collected before planting and after harvesting for each crop in each year. Edible grain samples of corn and wheat were collected at harvest. Elemental concentrations (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni) in soil and grains were determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results showed that the concentrations of heavy metals in the wastewater-irrigated soils were not significantly different (P‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05) compared with the freshwater-irrigated soils. No significant difference (P‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05) in heavy metal content in soil between different depths of emitters was found. A pollution load index (PLI) showed that there was no substantial buildup of heavy metals in the wastewater-irrigated soils compared to the freshwater-irrigated soils. Cu, Pb, and Zn concentrations in wheat and corn grains were within the permissible US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits, but concentrations of Cd (in wheat and corn) and Cr (in corn) were above the safe limits of the EPA. In addition, concentrations of Ni in wheat and corn seeds were several folds higher than the EPA standards. A health risk index (HRI) which is usually adopted to assess the health risk to hazard materials in foods showed values higher than 1 for Cd, particularly for wheat grain (HRI >2.5). Results also showed that intake of Cu through consumption of edible wheat grains posed a relatively high potential health risk to children (HRI >1.4), whereas children might also be exposed to health risk from Cd and Cr from corn grains (HRI >1.4). Based on aforementioned results, it can be concluded that the emitter depth in drip irrigation does not play a significant role in the accumulation of heavy metals from TWW in our sandy loam soil. Although their accumulation in the soil was limited and similar to using freshwater, uptake of Cd and Cr by wheat and corn was relatively large and hence resulted in health risk. The results suggest that more attention should be directed towards cultivation of other crops with drip irrigation system for a safe and more productive use of wastewater for irrigation. Alternatively, methods that filter the wastewater before it enters the soil environment might be an option that needs further investigation."

Past research focused mainly on the environmental impact, and we show for the first time what the human health risk through consumption of contaminated food crops is in these communities. This study was designed to determine the level of Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs) contamination in pond water, soil, and food crops and assess the health risk of inhabitants in the abandoned tin mining community in Bokkos LGA. Samples of the mining pond water, soil, and selected food crops from farms irrigated with the pond water: bitter leaf (Vernonia amygdalina), pepper (Piper nigrum), okra (Albelmoschus esculentus), maize (Zea mays), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), and Irish potato (Solanum tuberosum) were analyzed for each of the eight PTEs (viz. Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn, Cd, and Pb) using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The results obtained showed that the levels of all the PTEs analyzed in the soil, pond water, and selected food crops except for Fe and Mn in soil and Cd in sweet potato were greater than their corresponding background area values (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). Also, the mean concentrations of all the PTEs except for Cu in pond water were significantly (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) higher than the WHO maximum permissible limit. With the exception of Fe, Ni, and Zn for pepper and okra, Cu and Fe for maize grains as well as Cu, Ni, and Zn for sweet and Irish potatoes and Fe and Cd for sweet potato, the mean concentrations of PTEs in the food crops were significantly higher than WHO maximum permissible limit. The EF values of Cd (0.39); Cu (3.59) and Ni (2.81); Cr (9.38) and Pb (17.84); and Mn (178.13) and Zn (83.22) classified the soil as minimally, moderately, significantly, and extremely highly enriched, respectively. The PI values of all the PTEs in the soil studied were all greater than 5, indicating that the soils were severely contaminated. There was evidence that food crops significantly bioaccumulated PTEs either as a result of contaminated soil and/or irrigation water. The bioaccumulation was not uniform and was dominated by transfer from the polluted irrigation water. The bitter leaf, okra, and to some extent maize had the highest transfer of PTEs, and Mn, Cu, and Zn had the highest bioaccumulation in the food crops investigated. The hazardous index (HI) for the eight PTEs through the consumption of food crops was 107 for children and 33 for adults which greatly exceeded the recommended limit of 1, thus indicating that possible health risks exist for both local children and adults. For every PTE, the values of HI for children are many-fold higher than those for adults, which is of particular concern due to the high HI values for Pb found for maize consumption, a typical staple food. The cancer risk values for Cr and Ni for all the food crops were within 10-3-10-1 which is several fold higher than the permissible limits (10-6¬†and‚Äâ<‚Äâ10-4) indicating the high carcinogenic risk. It can be concluded based on the results and risk assessment provided by this study that human exposure to mining pond water and soil in farms around the mining pond through the food chain suggests the high vulnerability of the local community to PTE toxicity. Long-term preventive measures to safeguard the health of the residents need to be put in place."

The morpho-cultural characters were in compliance with the description of A. niger (Ahmed et al. 1993). For molecular identification, genomic DNA of four representative isolates was extracted using DNAzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, U. S. A. ). PCR amplification and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-rDNA, Œ≤-tubulin (BenA), partial RNA polymerase II largest subunit (RPB2), and translation elongation factor-1 alpha (TEF-1Œ±) gene regions were performed. Primers were ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), Bt2a/Bt2b (Glass et al. 1995), RPB2-5F/RPB2-7cR (Liu et al. 1999), and A-EF_F/A-EF_R (Perrone et al. 2011), respectively. The obtained sequences were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers MN922042.1, MN922043.1, MN922044.1, and MN922045.1 for ITS-rDNA; MT117920.1, MT117921.1, MT117922.1, and MT117923.1 for the BenA; MT318284.1, MT318285.1, MT318286.1, and MT318287.1 for RPB2; and MT318307.1, MT318308.1, MT318309.1, and MT318310.1 for TEF-1Œ±. BLASTn analysis showed 99% identity with submitted sequence of A. niger for ITS rDNA, BenA, RBP2, and TEF-1Œ±. To confirm Koch‚Äôs postulates, maize cultivars were grown in the research field of the Department of Plant Pathology, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan. For inoculation, a spore suspension was prepared by adding distilled water to Petri plate of A. niger culture to dissolve and harvest the spores. The concentration of the spore inoculum used was determined with a hemocytometer and adjusted to 1 √ó 10‚Å∂ spores/ml in sterile 0.01% Triton X-100. Using a 10-ml syringe the top ears of maize were inoculated at 30 to 35¬∞C with A. niger at milk growth stage by using 0.5 to 1 ml of inoculum per ear. After 14 days, disease symptoms similar to those observed in the field appeared in all inoculated but not in uninoculated ears of maize. A. niger had colonized the ears, as evidenced by visible sporulation on wounded kernels. These tests were repeated twice in the field, and Koch‚Äôs postulates were satisfied after reisolating the A. niger from the inoculated maize. A. niger contamination in maize was previously reported in the United States (Wicklow et al. 1987); however, to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of A. niger causing preharvest ear rot of maize in Pakistan. This finding will help to plan effective disease management strategies against preharvest ear rot of maize in Pakistan."

In some countries, including Belgium, the load with the biocide tributyltin (TBT) from ship coatings prohibits the dumping of harbour sludge into the sea. Land-based dumping is a commonly used alternative. This research investigated the feasibility to use land-deposited harbour sludge for plant production. In a field trial, the growth of 38 more or less salt-tolerant plant species on low and high TBT-contaminated sediments was studied. The elimination of TBT from sludge with and without vegetation was compared. The uptake of TBT and its degradation products di- and monobutyltin (DBT and MBT) into harvest products under field conditions was determined. EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP: Sediments dredged in May 2003 from the brackish waters of the port of Antwerp were analysed in the laboratory for soil texture, pH, electroconductivity, sodium, magnesium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, nitrate, total nitrogen, chloride, sulphur and the organotins TBT, DBT and MBT. The sediments were lagooned for one year to dewater, desalinate and improve their structure. Salt-tolerant domestic and wild plants were selected and sown in May 2004. In August 2004, plants were harvested and the produced biomass was determined. Samples were taken from vegetated and non-vegetated top and bottom sediments and from plants growing above soil and analysed for TBT, DBT and MBT. The fresh sediments showed a good supply with nutrients and a neutral pH, but were rather saline (EC 14 mS cm(-1) of the saturated paste extract). The salinity decreased to 3.7 mS cm(-1) during lagoonation. The high and the low contaminated sediment had initially 43 and 1.6 mg TBT kg(-1) dry weight, respectively. Besides TBT, several other contaminants were present in the sediments at critical levels. The biomass production of the plant species from the field trial ranged from 0.2 to 13 tons dry mass per hectare. Plants performing excellently were barley, sorghum, rape seed, a clover/grass mix and reed. If at all, a positive influence of TBT on plant growth was seen. TBT was degraded significantly faster (>40%) below barley. The uptake of TBT, DBT and MBT into stem and leaves of reed, grass and clover was very low, but measurable and not related to concentrations in soil. No uptake of TBT or its metabolites into corn of barley was found. This study confirmed former results: the toxicity of TBT to higher plants is low, and even high levels in soils would not be a hindrance for crop production. The removal of TBT seemed to be increased by both lagooning and plant growth, although the target values for sea dumping in use in certain European countries were not reached. A plausible explanation for the faster degradation of TBT under vegetation is that oxygen is a limiting factor, and plants dewater the soil, thus aerating it. The uptake of the organotins TBT, DBT and MBT into harvest products is probably due to attached soil particles. To summarize, barley was the optimal species: it grew very well despite the salinity of the dredged sediments, it had a significantly positive effect on TBT removal; it showed no measurable uptake of TBT or the other butyltins into the harvested product; and it is a cash crop well established in European agriculture. The amounts of dredged sediments are high, and good soils are becoming increasingly rare. The feasibility of using dredged sediments for non-food production, such as energy crops, should be investigated by a critical risk assessment."

            }</s>","Barley (Hordeum vulgare L. ) is a secondary grain crop in Serbia used commercially for animal feed, seed, and human food applications. The production of barley in the 2016 to 2017 growing season reached a record yield of almost 400,000 metric tons (USDA 2017). Aspergillus contamination has been rare in the agroecological conditions of cereal-growing areas in Serbia. Changes in climatic factors, such as occurrence of high temperatures and prolonged droughts, increased frequency of Aspergillus spp. Species Aspergillus parasiticus was isolated from maize grain for the first time in Serbia in 2012 and from wheat grains in 2017 (Nikolic et al. 2018). We hypothesized that these pathogens can also be present in barley fields in Serbia. Barley spikes exhibiting bleaching were sampled at the beginning of June 2017 grown in northern Serbia. In severe infections, barley spikes get a dry look with awns that stand upright and firm. The incidence of the disease of the bleached spiked in the field was 15 to 20%. From each representative sample, 100 shriveled grains were collected. After surface sterilization with bleach/distilled water 1:3, 100 grains per sample (10 per Petri dish) were placed on potato dextrose agar and incubated at 25¬∞C for 7 days. After isolation, 50% of isolates were identified as Alternaria spp. , 20% as Fusarium spp. , approximately 15% as Aspergillus spp. In order to reliably identify individual species of fungi, the fragments of colonies were transferred to malt extract agar (MEA) and Czapek yeast agar (CYA) and incubated in the dark for 7 days. The fungal colonies were dark green. The reverse side was pale yellow. The average colony diameter was 65 mm. Conidia were spherical and rough with thick walls. The average size of conidia was 5.1 ¬µm. Colonies were floccose and thin on MEA and CYA. Based on growth and morphological characteristics, isolates were determined as A. parasiticus (Pitt and Hocking 2009). Molecular detection of Aspergillus species was done by using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the aflR-aflJ (genes for aflatoxin biosynthesis) intergenic spacer. The restriction enzyme BglII was able to cut the PCR product of A. parasiticus at one restriction site, resulting in two fragments of 363 and 311 bp (El Khoury et al. 2011). A. parasiticus CBS 100926 was used as a reference isolate. The pathogenicity of 20 isolates was verified on a group of 20 randomly selected spikes in four replicates (Mesterh√°zy et al. 1999). A 7-day-old culture of each isolate was used for the preparation of the spore suspension (1 √ó 10‚Å∂ spores/ml). Inoculation was carried out after 50% of plants reached the anthesis stage. Groups of 20 selected spikes were sprayed from all sides with 20 ml of fungal spore suspension. Control spikes were inoculated by applying an equal amount of sterile distilled water. The infection rate was estimated after 3 weeks on a 1 to 7 scale, with 1 = 0 to 5%, 2 = 5 to 15%, 3 = 15 to 30%, 4 = 30 to 50%, 5 = 50 to 75%, 6 = 75 to 90%, and 7 = 90 to 100% infected spike area. The average infection rate was 3.2. The pathogen was reisolated from the inoculated spikes and identified as A. parasiticus, with the aim to confirm Koch‚Äôs postulates. Developed symptoms were similar to those observed on spikes collected from the field. Control spikes did not show any symptoms of the disease. These results confirmed the pathogenicity of A. parasiticus on H. vulgare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the occurrence of A. parasiticus on barley grain in Serbia. Because A. parasiticus is known to be a severe aflatoxin producer and climatic changes can increase the frequency of this fungus, further studies are necessary to improve strategies for food safety and quality."

Those who work in agriculture and are regularly exposed to pesticides are the most impacted. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that three million severe pesticide poisoning episodes occur globally each year, with at least 300.000 deaths and 99% of cases occurring in low- and middle-income nations. The effects of longer-term exposure to pesticides on health are not yet precisely estimated. To this end, the objective of this study is to assess the knowledge of pesticide residues and common pesticides in grain-based food (brown and white beans, yellow and white maize, brown millet and rice) about pesticide use in selected markets of Southwest Nigeria. The markets were Oja-titun (market) Ile-Ife, Osun; Alesinloye Market Ibadan, Oyo; Oja Oba, Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti; and Oja Oba, Akure Ondo State. The identification and quantification of pesticide residues was done using a Varian 3800/4000 gas chromatograph mass spectrometer while 60 structured questionnaires were administered to respondents including food merchants, buyers/consumers as well as food vendors. A total of 240 respondents were selected from four states (Ado-Ekiti, Ibadan, Osun and Ondo) with the aid of structured questionnaire and interview guide using purposive sampling technique. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Up to 50.4% never read instructions on pesticide application while a shared 24.8% read them always and occasionally. The number of respondents who never read the instructions were particularly high in Ekiti and Ondo, up to 52.5% of the respondents in Ekiti do not know whether or not they are exposed to pesticides during application. Also, majority of the respondents never attended any professional training on pesticide application, this amounted to 79.3%. Most people were not aware that unsafe pesticide application is harmful to human health. Similarly, a wide variety of symptoms were reported by respondents following pesticide application or consumption of grains, these included headaches and dizziness, itching and redness of the eyes, skin allergy, diarrhea, and stomach disorder, vomiting and loss of appetite, weakness of the body, asthma, permanent skin patches, shortness of breath, excessive sweating. Millet recorded the highest number of OCP residues while maize had the lowest. On the contrary, maize had the highest number of OPP and carbamate residues while millet had the lowest number of OPP residues. Meanwhile, maize, rice and beans had only one carbamate pesticide residue. According to the study‚Äôs conclusions, farmers who can only get information from agricultural extension officials should receive urgent and immediate attention for raising awareness. Additionally, extensive IPM training programs must be created with the intention of disseminating precautions for protecting human health and a healthy agro-ecosystem. In order to find more effective pest management methods that utilize less pesticides, it is crucial to reevaluate the pesticide residues and common pesticides found in grains in the targeted markets. To reduce farmers‚Äô exposure to pesticides, it is also required to establish personal protective measures, special educational initiatives, and legislation promoting the use of safer pesticides. This study gives policymakers a comprehensive understanding of the ways that may be utilized to close the significant knowledge gap on pesticide residues in grains and provides an insight into the knowledge of pesticide residues and common pesticides in grains."

The relationship between the uptake of Cd, Pb, Zn, and As by maize plants and the morphological content of heavy metals in the soil was also discussed through principal component analysis and correlation analysis of the concentrations of eight heavy metals, including Cd, Hg, As, Pb, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn. The results showed that:‚ë† the distribution pattern of Cd and Zn contents in different parts of the maize plant was as follows:upper stalk>lower stalk>root>seed, the distribution pattern of Pb was As follows:root>lower stalk>upper stalk>seed, and the As distribution pattern was:root>upper stalk>lower stalk>seed. The different distribution patterns were closely related to the accumulation characteristics of the crop itself and the environmental activity of Cd, Pb, Zn, and As in the soil of the study area. ‚ë° There were significant differences in Cd and Pb accumulation among 22 maize cultivars due to their genetic background (P<0.05), which showed four trends:Cd and Pb compound high-accumulation varieties, single Cd or Pb low-accumulation varieties (low Cd and high Pb, low Pb and high Cd), and Cd and Pb compound low-accumulation varieties. Among them, the content of Cd in the grain of the three varieties exceeded the national food safety standard, and the content of Cd in the stem and leaf of 14 varieties exceeded the national food health standard. The Pb content in stems, leaves, and grains of all cultivars did not exceed the standard, but the Pb content in grains of some cultivars was close to the limit and had the risk of exceeding the standard. The content of As in the stem, leaf, and grain of different maize varieties was much lower than the standard limit value, showing a stable low-accumulation characteristic. The content of Zn in the stem and leaf of different maize varieties increased with the increase in the content of Zn in soil, but the content of Zn in grain remained within the threshold of normal plant growth. ‚ë¢ Cd, Pb, Zn, and As in maize plants in the study area had a certain homology and were mainly affected by the excessive levels of Cd, Pb, Zn, and As pollutants in the soil. This showed that anthropogenic sources were brought about by mine extraction and tailings stockpiles, whereas Cu elements in maize plants were affected by certain anthropogenic pollution sources, though to a limited extent. Hg, Ni, and Cr in maize plants had a certain homology; this showed the natural source of soil parent material and weathering product accumulation. ‚ë£ The contents of Cd, Pb, Zn, and As elements in various parts of the corn plant, as well as the contents of Cr and Ni elements all had a very significant positive correlation (P<0.01). The transport mechanisms of Cd, Pb, Zn, and As elements in the plant may have a common. However, there was a synergistic effect in the migration from the root of the corn to the upper part of the ground, and the same was true for the elements of Cr and Ni. The elements of Hg and Cd, Pb, Zn, and As in the corn stems and leaves and Hg and Cd, Hg, As, Pb, Cr, Ni, and Zn in grains all showed certain antagonistic effects. ‚ë§ The comparison method simultaneously satisfied the following requirements:the contents of Cd, Pb, and As in stems and leaves did not exceed the national food hygiene standards, and the contents of Cd, Pb, and As in the grains did not exceed the national food safety standards. The cluster analysis of Cd, Pb, and As in grains was a low-accumulation group, and the enrichment and transport coefficients of Cd, Pb, and As in the stems and leaves and grains were low as the optimal conditions. C18 (Xianyu 335) could be selected as the optimal maize variety with low accumulation of Cd, Pb, and As and normal Zn content in grain, which is suitable for promoting and applying in the heavy metal complex-polluted farmland around industrial and mining enterprises in north China."

Can you please provide me with the text so that I can identify the chemical items mentioned in it?</s>","BACKGROUND:Due to increasing pressure on natural resources, subsistence agriculture communities in Uganda and Sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing increasingly restricted access to diminishing natural resources that are a critical requirement of their livelihoods. Previously, common-pool resources like forests and grasslands have been either gazetted for conservation or leased for agriculture, the latter in particular for large-scale sugarcane production. Satisfying the increasing consumer demand for grassland or forestry products like wild mushrooms as food or medicine, requires innovative ethno-biological and industry development strategies to improve production capacity, while easing the pressure on diminishing natural resources and averting ecosystems degradation. METHODS:This case study addresses traditional knowledge systems for artisanal mycoculture to identify cultivation practices that enhance sustainable utilization of natural resources. Multi-scalar stakeholder engagement across government and community sectors identified artisanal mushroom producers across five districts in Uganda. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews characterized artisanal production methods and identified locally used substrates for cultivation of different mushroom species. RESULTS:Artisanal practices were characterized for the cultivation of six wild saprophytic mushroom species including Volvariella speciosa (akasukusuku), two¬†Termitomyces sp. (obunegyere and another locally unnamed species), Agaricus sp. (ensyabire) and Agrocybe sp. (emponzira), and one exotic Pleurotus sp. (oyster) that are used as food or medicine. The substrates used for each species differed according to the mushroom's mode of decomposition, those being the following: tertiary decomposers such as those growing under rotting tree stumps or logs from forestry activity like the Agrocybe sp. known as emponzira which grows in forests, thickets, or near homesteads where big logs of hardwood have been left to rot. Also pieces of firewood are chipped off whenever need arises thus providing fuel; secondary decomposers growing on naturally composted grass associated with termites like the Termitomyces sp. known as obunegyere growing in protected sites in gardens, composted cattle manure for Agaricus sp. known as ensyabire in the kraal area where cattle manure is plenty, composted maize cobs for a locally unnamed Agaricus sp. on heaped cobs placed near homesteads; and primary decomposers growing on waste sorghum from brewing the traditional alcoholic drink, muramba for Pleurotus sp. (oyster), and banana and spear grass residue from banana juice processing like the Volvariella speciosa known as akasukusuku because it is associated with the banana plantation locally known in the Luganda language as olusuku and is usually heaped under ficus trees. Management practices also varied based on mode of decomposition and other ecological requirements such as the following: zero tillage and minimal disturbance in areas where obunegyere grow, heaping banana and spear grass residues under the cool ficus trees which also keep them away from banana stump that may cause infestation with nematodes and insects. Even within the generic practices accessibility by the users is critical for example placing logs near homes where children can use them to play, they can be used as fire wood and to even get off-season mushroom as household waste water can make the mushrooms grow. CONCLUSIONS:Our description of artisanal mycoculture methods that respond to conservation and utilization pressures, demonstrates the value of addressing traditional knowledge to improve ethno-biology and mycoculture industry practice. Traditional communities engage in multiple technological and organizational innovations and practices for sustainability and in the case of mushroom production to conserve the environment and culture, ensure variety, food and nutrition security, and income. The results of this study present opportunities to preserve ecosystem quality while developing an artisanal mycoculture system. They have also identified aspects of artisanal mycoculture that most urgently require further ethno-biological study and industry development. Future research and industry development can utilize the result of this study to boost artisanal production of wild saprophytic mushrooms in Sub-Saharan countries, for food or medicinal consumption, and environment conservation. Further development of production efficiencies in context with sustainable natural resource management is recommended."

Its use potentially overlaps with the ranges of listed (threatened and endangered) species. In response to registration review in the context of the Endangered Species Act, we evaluated potential direct and indirect impacts of atrazine on listed species and designated critical habitats. Atrazine has been widely studied, extensive environmental monitoring and toxicity data sets are available, and the spatial and temporal uses on major crops are well characterized. Ranges of listed species are less well-defined, resulting in overly conservative designations of ""May Effect"". Preferences for habitat and food sources serve to limit exposure among many listed animal species and animals are relatively insensitive. Atrazine does not bioaccumulate, further diminishing exposures among consumers and predators. Because of incomplete exposure pathways, many species can be eliminated from consideration for direct effects. It is toxic to plants, but even sensitive plants tolerate episodic exposures, such as those occurring in flowing waters. Empirical data from long-term monitoring programs and realistic field data on off-target deposition of drift indicate that many other listed species can be removed from consideration because exposures are below conservative toxicity thresholds for direct and indirect effects. Combined with recent mitigation actions by the registrant, this review serves to refine and focus forthcoming listed species assessment efforts for atrazine.

Overall,the collective evidence from the modeling and field study lines of evidence indicate that flowable and granular CPY do not pose significant risks to the bird communities foraging in agro-ecosystems in the United States. The available information indicates that avian incidents resulting from the legal, registered uses of CPY have been very infrequent since 2002 (see SI Appendix 3). The small number of recent incidents suggests that the current labels for CPY are generally protective of birds. However, incident data are uncertain because of the difficulties associated with finding dead birds in the field and linking any mortality observed to CPY. Plowable CPY is registered for a variety of crops in the United States including alfalfa, brassica vegetables, citrus, corn, cotton, grape, mint, onion, peanut, pome and stone fruits, soybean, sugar beet, sunflower, sweet potato, tree nuts, and wheat under the trade name Lorsban Advanced. The major routes of exposure for birds to flowable CPY were consumption of treated dietary items and drinking water. The Liquid Pesticide Avian Risk Assessment Model (Liquid PARAM) was used to simulate avian ingestion of CPY by these routes of exposure. For acute exposure,Liquid PARAM estimated the maximum retained dose in each of 20 birds on each of1,000 fields that were treated with CPY over the 60-d period following initial application. The model used a 1-h time step. For species lacking acceptable acute oral toxicity data (all focal species except northern bobwhite (C. virginianus) and redwinged blackbird (A. phoeniceus)), a species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approach was used to generate hypothetical dose-response curves assuming high, median and low sensitivity to CPY. For acute risk, risk curves were generated for each use pattern and exposure scenario. The risk curves show the relationship between exceedence probability and percent mortality. The results of the Liquid PARAM modeling exercise indicate that flow able CPY poses an acute risk to some bird species, particularly those species that are highly sensitive and that forage extensively in crops with high maximum application rates (e. g. , grapefruit, orange). Overall, most bird species would not experience significant mortality as a result of exposure to flowable CPY. The results of a number of field studies conducted at application rates comparable to those on the Lorsban Advanced label indicate that flowable CPY rarely causes avian mortality. The results of the field studies suggest that Liquid PARAM is likely over-estimating acute risk to birds for flowable CPY. For chronic exposure, Liquid PARAM estimated the maximum total daily intake (TDI) over a user-specified exposure duration (28-d in the case of CPY). The maximum average TDI was compared to the chronic NOEL and LOEL from the most sensitive species tested for CPY, the mallard. This comparison was done for each of the 20 birds in each of the 1000 fields simulated in Liquid PARAM. The outpu¬∑ ~ are estimates of the probabilities of exceeding the NOEL and LOEL. Liquid PAkAM did not predict significant adverse effects resulting from chronic exposure to flowable CPY. The small number of incidents (2) involving CPY reported since 2002 suggests that the current labels for CPY are generally protective of birds. Granular CPY is registered for a wide variety of crops including brassica vegetables, corn, onion, peanut, sugar beet, sunflower, and tobacco under the trade name Lorsban 15G. Consumption of grit is required by many birds to aid in digestion of hard dietary items such as seeds and insects. Because CPY granules are in the same size range as natural grit particles consumed by birds, there is a potential for birds to mistakenly ingest granular CPY instead of natural grit. We developed the Granular Pesticide Avian Risk Model (GranPARAM) to simulate grit ingestion behavior by birds. The model accounts for proportion of time that birds forage for grit in treated fields, relative proportions of natural grit versus pesticide granules onthe surface of treated fields, rates of ingestion of grit, attractiveness of pesticide granules relative to natural grit and so on. For CPY, each model simulation included20 birds on each of 1,000 fields to capture variability in rates of ingestion of grit and for aging behavior between birds within a focal species, and variability in soil composition between fields for the selected use pattern. The estimated dose for each birdwas compared with randomly chosen doses from relevant dose-response curves forCPY. Our analysis for a wide variety of use patterns on the Lorsban 15G label found that granular CPY poses little risk of causing mortality to bird species that frequent treated fields immediately after application. The predictions of the model have been confirmed in several avian field studies conducted with Lorsban 15G at application rates similar to or exceeding maximum application rates on the Lorsban 15G label."

The chemicals, the chemicals, the chemicals, food, food, the chemicals.</s>","The development and use of entomopathogens as classical, conservation and augmentative biological control agents have included a number of successes and some setbacks in the past 1years. In this forum paper we present current information on development, use and future directions of insect-specific viruses, bacteria, fungi and nematodes as components of integrated pest management strategies for control of arthropod pests of crops, forests, urban habitats, and insects of medical and veterinary importance. Insect pathogenic viruses are a fruitful source of microbial control agents (MCAs), particularly for the control of lepidopteran pests. Most research is focused on the baculoviruses, important pathogens of some globally important pests for which control has become difficult due to either pesticide resistance or pressure to reduce pesticide residues. Baculoviruses are accepted as safe, readily mass produced, highly pathogenic and easily formulated and applied control agents. New baculovirus products are appearing in many countries and gaining an increased market share. However, the absence of a practical in vitro mass production system, generally higher production costs, limited post application persistence, slow rate of kill and high host specificity currently contribute to restricted use in pest control. Overcoming these limitations are key research areas for which progress could open up use of insect viruses to much larger markets. A small number of entomopathogenic bacteria have been commercially developed for control of insect pests. These include several Bacillus thuringiensis sub-species, Lysinibacillus (Bacillus) sphaericus, Paenibacillus spp. and Serratia entomophila. B. thuringiensis sub-species kurstaki is the most widely used for control of pest insects of crops and forests, and B. thuringiensis sub-species israelensis and L. sphaericus are the primary pathogens used for control of medically important pests including dipteran vectors. These pathogens combine the advantages of chemical pesticides and MCAs: they are fast acting, easy to produce at a relatively low cost, easy to formulate, have a long shelf life and allow delivery using conventional application equipment and systemics (i. e. in transgenic plants). Unlike broad spectrum chemical pesticides, B. thuringiensis toxins are selective and negative environmental impact is very limited. Of the several commercially produced MCAs, B. thuringiensis (Bt) has more than 50% of market share. Extensive research, particularly on the molecular mode of action of Bt toxins, has been conducted over the past two decades. The Bt genes used in insect-resistant transgenic crops belong to the Cry and vegetative insecticidal protein families of toxins. Bt has been highly efficacious in pest management of corn and cotton, drastically reducing the amount of broad spectrum chemical insecticides used while being safe for consumers and non-target organisms. Despite successes, the adoption of Bt crops has not been without controversy. Although there is a lack of scientific evidence regarding their detrimental effects, this controversy has created the widespread perception in some quarters that Bt crops are dangerous for the environment. In addition to discovery of more efficacious isolates and toxins, an increase in the use of Bt products and transgenes will rely on innovations in formulation, better delivery systems and ultimately, wider public acceptance of transgenic plants expressing insect-specific Bt toxins. Fungi are ubiquitous natural entomopathogens that often cause epizootics in host insects and possess many desirable traits that favor their development as MCAs. Presently, commercialized microbial pesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi largely occupy niche markets. A variety of molecular tools and technologies have recently allowed reclassification of numerous species based on phylogeny, as well as matching anamorphs (asexual forms) and teleomorphs (sexual forms) of several entomopathogenic taxa in the Phylum Ascomycota. Although these fungi have been traditionally regarded exclusively as pathogens of arthropods, recent studies have demonstrated that they occupy a great diversity of ecological niches. Entomopathogenic fungi are now known to be plant endophytes, plant disease antagonists, rhizosphere colonizers, and plant growth promoters. These newly understood attributes provide possibilities to use fungi in multiple roles. In addition to arthropod pest control, some fungal species could simultaneously suppress plant pathogens and plant parasitic nematodes as well as promote plant growth. A greater understanding of fungal ecology is needed to define their roles in nature and evaluate their limitations in biological control. More efficient mass production, formulation and delivery systems must be devised to supply an ever increasing market. More testing under field conditions is required to identify effects of biotic and abiotic factors on efficacy and persistence. Lastly, greater attention must be paid to their use within integrated pest management programs; in particular, strategies that incorporate fungi in combination with arthropod predators and parasitoids need to be defined to ensure compatibility and maximize efficacy. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) in the genera Steinernema and Heterorhabditis are potent MCAs. Substantial progress in research and application of EPNs has been made in the past decade. The number of target pests shown to be susceptible to EPNs has continued to increase. Advancements in this regard primarily have been made in soil habitats where EPNs are shielded from environmental extremes, but progress has also been made in use of nematodes in above-ground habitats owing to the development of improved protective formulations. Progress has also resulted from advancements in nematode production technology using both in vivo and in vitro systems; novel application methods such as distribution of infected host cadavers; and nematode strain improvement via enhancement and stabilization of beneficial traits. Innovative research has also yielded insights into the fundamentals of EPN biology including major advances in genomics, nematode-bacterial symbiont interactions, ecological relationships, and foraging behavior. Additional research is needed to leverage these basic findings toward direct improvements in microbial control."

","In this report the various elements of the safety and nutritional assessment procedure for genetically modified (GM) plant derived food and feed are discussed, in particular the potential and limitations of animal feeding trials for the safety and nutritional testing of whole GM food and feed. The general principles for the risk assessment of GM plants and derived food and feed are followed, as described in the EFSA guidance document of the EFSA Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms. In Section 1 the mandate, scope and general principles for risk assessment of GM plant derived food and feed are discussed. Products under consideration are food and feed derived from GM plants, such as maize, soybeans, oilseed rape and cotton, modified through the introduction of one or more genes coding for agronomic input traits like herbicide tolerance and/or insect resistance. Furthermore GM plant derived food and feed, which have been obtained through extensive genetic modifications targeted at specific alterations of metabolic pathways leading to improved nutritional and/or health characteristics, such as rice containing beta-carotene, soybeans with enhanced oleic acid content, or tomato with increased concentration of flavonoids, are considered. The safety assessment of GM plants and derived food and feed follows a comparative approach, i. e. the food and feed are compared with their non-GM counterparts in order to identify intended and unintended (unexpected) differences which subsequently are assessed with respect to their potential impact on the environment, safety for humans and animals, and nutritional quality. Key elements of the assessment procedure are the molecular, compositional, phenotypic and agronomic analysis in order to identify similarities and differences between the GM plant and its near isogenic counterpart. The safety assessment is focussed on (i) the presence and characteristics of newly expressed proteins and other new constituents and possible changes in the level of natural constituents beyond normal variation, and on the characteristics of the GM food and feed, and (ii) the possible occurrence of unintended (unexpected) effects in GM plants due to genetic modification. In order to identify these effects a comparative phenotypic and molecular analysis of the GM plant and its near isogenic counterpart is carried out, in parallel with a targeted analysis of single specific compounds, which represent important metabolic pathways in the plant like macro and micro nutrients, known anti-nutrients and toxins. Significant differences may be indicative of the occurrence of unintended effects, which require further investigation. Section 2 provides an overview of studies performed for the safety and nutritional assessment of whole food and feed. Extensive experience has been built up in recent decades from the safety and nutritional testing in animals of irradiated foods, novel foods and fruit and vegetables. These approaches are also relevant for the safety and nutritional testing of whole GM food and feed. Many feeding trials have been reported in which GM foods like maize, potatoes, rice, soybeans and tomatoes have been fed to rats or mice for prolonged periods, and parameters such as body weight, feed consumption, blood chemistry, organ weights, histopathology etc have been measured. The food and feed under investigation were derived from GM plants with improved agronomic characteristics like herbicide tolerance and/or insect resistance. The majority of these experiments did not indicate clinical effects or histopathological abnormalities in organs or tissues of exposed animals. In some cases adverse effects were noted, which were difficult to interpret due to shortcomings in the studies. Many studies have also been carried out with feed derived from GM plants with agronomic input traits in target animal species to assess the nutritive value of the feed and their performance potential. Studies in sheep, pigs, broilers, lactating dairy cows, and fish, comparing the in vivo bioavailability of nutrients from a range of GM plants with their near isogenic counterpart and commercial varieties, showed that they were comparable with those for near isogenic non-GM lines and commercial varieties. In Section 3 toxicological in vivo, in silico, and in vitro test methods are discussed which may be applied for the safety and nutritional assessment of specific compounds present in food and feed or of whole food and feed derived from GM plants. Moreover the purpose, potential and limitations of the 90-day rodent feeding trial for the safety and nutritional testing of whole food and feed have been examined. Methods for single and repeated dose toxicity testing, reproductive and developmental toxicity testing and immunotoxicity testing, as described in OECD guideline tests for single well-defined chemicals are discussed and considered to be adequate for the safety testing of single substances including new products in GM food and feed. Various in silico and in vitro methods may contribute to the safety assessment of GM plant derived food and feed and components thereof, like (i) in silico searches for sequence homology and/or structural similarity of novel proteins or their degradation products to known toxic or allergenic proteins, (ii) simulated gastric and intestinal fluids in order to study the digestive stability of newly expressed proteins and in vitro systems for analysis of the stability of the novel protein under heat or other processing conditions, and (iii) in vitro genotoxicity test methods that screen for point mutations, chromosomal aberrations and DNA damage/repair. The current performance of the safety assessment of whole foods is mainly based on the protocols for low-molecular-weight chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, pesticides, food additives and contaminants. However without adaptation, these protocols have limitations for testing of whole food and feed. This primarily results from the fact that defined single substances can be dosed to laboratory animals at very large multiples of the expected human exposure, thus giving a large margin of safety. In contrast foodstuffs are bulky, lead to satiation and can only be included in the diet at much lower multiples of expected human intakes. When testing whole foods, the possible highest concentration of the GM food and feed in the laboratory animal diet may be limited because of nutritional imbalance of the diet, or by the presence of compounds with a known toxicological profile. The aim of the 90-days rodent feeding study with the whole GM food and feed is to assess potential unintended effects of toxicological and/or nutritional relevance and to establish whether the GM food and feed is as safe and nutritious as its traditional comparator rather than determining qualitative and quantitative intrinsic toxicity of defined food constituents. The design of the study should be adapted from the OECD 90-day rodent toxicity study. The precise study design has to take into account the nature of the food and feed and the characteristics of the new trait(s) and their intended role in the GM food and feed. A 90-day animal feeding trial has a large capacity (sensitivity and specificity) to detect potential toxicological effects of single well defined compounds. This can be concluded from data reported on the toxicology of a wide range of industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food substances, environmental, and agricultural chemicals. It is possible to model the sensitivity of the rat subchronic feeding study for the detection of hypothetically increased amount of compounds such as anti-nutrients, toxicants or secondary metabolites. With respect to the detection of potential unintended effects in whole GM food and feed, it is unlikely that substances present in small amounts and with a low toxic potential will result in any observable (unintended) effects in a 90-day rodent feeding study, as they would be below the no-observed-effect-level and thus of unlikely impact to human health at normal intake levels. Laboratory animal feeding studies of 90-days duration appear to be sufficient to pick up adverse effects of diverse compounds that would also give adverse effects after chronic exposure. This conclusion is based on literature data from studies investigating whether toxicological effects are adequately identified in 3-month subchronic studies in rodents, by comparing findings at 3 and 24 months for a range of different chemicals. The 90-day rodent feeding study is not designed to detect effects on reproduction or development other than effects on adult reproductive organ weights and histopathology. Analyses of available data indicate that, for a wide range of substances, reproductive and developmental effects are not potentially more sensitive endpoints than those examined in subchronic toxicity tests. Should there be structural alerts for reproductive/developmental effects or other indications from data available on a GM food and feed, then these tests should be considered. By relating the estimated daily intake, or theoretical maximum daily intake per capita for a given whole food (or the sum of its individual commercial constituents) to that consumed on average per rat per day in the subchronic 90-day feeding study, it is possible to establish the margin of exposure (safety margin) for consumers. Results obtained from testing GM food and feed in rodents indicate that large (at least 100-fold) 'safety' margins exist between animal exposure levels without observed adverse effects and estimated human daily intake. Results of feeding studies with feed derived from GM plants with improved agronomic properties, carried out in a wide range of livestock species, are discussed. The studies did not show any biologically relevant differences in the parameters tested between control and test animals. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"
