Several factors are involved in Fusarium disease and mycotoxin occurrence and among them environmental factors and the agronomic practices have been shown to deeply affect mycotoxin contamination in the field. In the present review particular emphasis will be placed on how environmental conditions and stress factors for the crops can affect Fusarium infection and mycotoxin production, with the aim to provide useful knowledge to develop strategies to prevent mycotoxin accumulation in cereals."

Original clay and pillared clays were characterized in terms of X-ray powder diffraction analysis and N(2) adsorption-desorption isotherms. The maximum amounts of adsorption of ZEN by K10, Al-K10, and Fe-K10 at 25°C and pH 7 were 0.202, 1.305, and 1.028 mg/g and 0.264, 0.096, and 0.255 mg/g, calculated from Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, respectively. The adsorption of ZEN was also studied as a function of adsorbent amount (1 to 30 mg), ZEN concentration (2 to 20 mg/liter), pH of solution (pH 4 to 10), and contact time. Pillared clays could be an excellent alternative for removing ZEN in contaminated food samples and are potentially low-cost adsorbents with a promising future as an alternative to more costly materials."

Unfortunately, corn, a major staple crop worldwide, is highly susceptible to mycotoxin contamination. Some mycotoxins, most notably aflatoxin, cause human cancer and other harmful effects such as immunotoxicity and growth impairment. Hence, many nations have set food-safety standards on mycotoxins. Aside from regulations, good agricultural and manufacturing practices lower mycotoxin risks. Agricultural biotechnology has made notable advances in reducing mycotoxins recently. While transgenic Bt corn has been known for years to reduce the mycotoxin fumonisin, new studies have shown its benefit in reducing aflatoxin as well. Other transgenic and RNA-interference corn hybrids target mycotoxin reduction specifically, and gene editing through clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat systems has focused on preventing mycotoxin biosynthesis."

Two different concentrations of PFAAs were applied as aqueous solution to the soil to attain target concentrations of 0.25 mg or 1.00 mg of PFAA per kg of soil. Maize was grown in pots, and after harvesting, PFAA concentrations were measured in the straw and kernels of maize. PFCA and PFSA concentrations of straw decreased significantly with increasing chain length. In maize kernels, only PFCAs with a chain length ≤ C8 as well as perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) were detected.

No evidence was found for the presence of GM wheat or rice in the foodstuffs tested; however, 6 feeds and 3 food products containing soybean and/or maize were positive for one or more GM elements. GM events present in positive samples were identified by event-specific PCR and quantified by real-time PCR. We also compared the results with previous surveys in Turkey. Overall, we observed consistent use of GM animal feeds; however, these were not labelled as GM at the point of sale. Occasional food products also tested positive for GM ingredients, usually at low concentrations that could be attributed to accidental contamination."

Its toxic activity on haematopoietic human cell lines and its teratogenic effects on chicken embryos has been recently proved. Therefore a sensitive, rapid, and inexpensive screening test to detect FP in agricultural commodities is necessary to protect human health. FP-hemiglutarate conjugated to modified bovine serum albumin was synthesized, characterized, and used as an antigen for raising polyclonal antibodies by immunizing rabbits. Indirect and competitive ELISA and immunoblotting analyses were performed to determine antibody specificity towards the mycotoxin. The determination of 10 micrograms of free FP/mL was achieved using antibodies purified by means of affinity chromatography on a FP-lysine-Sepharose column. This unsatisfactory detection limit is due to high background values; thus, this method is not competitive with traditional UV-HPLC methods."

Initial reports in the United States and other countries have associated Bt expression with reduced fumonisin, deoxynivalenol, and zearalenone contamination and, to a lesser extent, reduced aflatoxin contamination in harvested maize kernels. However, subsequent field results have been inconsistent, confirming that fumonisin contamination can be reduced by Bt expression, but the effect on aflatoxin is, at present, inconclusive.

Fusarium species occurring on this crop have not been reported. Approximately 13% of the Fusarium isolates recovered from finger millet growing at three different locations in eastern Uganda belong to Fusarium verticillioides, and could produce up to 18,600 µg/g of total fumonisins when cultured under laboratory conditions. These strains are all genetically unique, based on AFLP analyses, and form fertile perithecia when crossed with the standard mating type tester strains for this species. All but one of the strains is female-fertile and mating-type segregates 13:20 Mat-1:Mat-2. Three new sequences of the gene encoding translation elongation factor 1-α were found within the population. These results indicate a potential health risk for infants who consume finger millet gruel as a weaning food, and are consistent with the hypothesis that F. verticillioides originated in Africa and not in the Americas, despite its widespread association with maize grown almost anywhere worldwide."

B. subtilis showed strong effects on the fate and mobility of Pb, Sb, Ni, Zn, Cu, and Cr, and it also affected PTMs' distribution in the rhizosphere soil, maize growth, and microbial community structure. Results showed that it was easier for Zn to accumulate in maize roots than other PTMs. According to chemical fractionation, B. subtilis tended to immobilize Pb, Sb, Ni, Zn, and Cu in the rhizosphere soil. Compared with other PTMs, Cr tended to be more available and more mobile, which indicated a higher health risk to the eco-environment. These findings suggested that B. subtilis could be used as a geomicrobiological stabilizer to immobilize PTMs (Pb, Sb, Ni, Cu, Zn) in alkaline soils and decrease their uptake by plants, thus reducing the risks of a potential transfer into the food chain."

The bifunctional aptamer was engineered by splicing a ZEN aptamer and an OTA aptamer with a linker according to the structure analysis of aptamers. The binding mechanism of the bifunctional aptamer to ZEN and OTA were revealed basing on the molecular docking studies. The MST assay proved that the bifunctional aptamer showed high affinity and specificity towards ZEN and OTA. Furthermore, a bifunctional aptamer-based MST-aptasensor was developed for simultaneous detection of ZEN and OTA in corn oil sample.

The discovery of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins with effective insecticidal activity against pests and the development of transgenic technology of plants opened a new era of pest control. Transgenic Bt crops, including maize, cotton and soya bean, have now been produced and commercialized to protect against about 30 major coleopteran and lepidopteran pests, greatly benefiting the environment and the economy. However, with the long-term cultivation of Bt crops, some target pests have gradually developed resistance. Numerous studies have indicated that mutations in genes for toxins activation, toxin-binding and insect immunization are important sources in Bt resistance. An in-depth exploration of the corresponding Bt-resistance mechanisms will aid in the design of new strategies to prevent and control pests. Future research will focus on Bt crops expressing new genes and multiple genes to control a broader range of pests as part of an integrated pest management programme.

A survey involving 17 dairy goat farms of north-eastern Italy was completed during 2005 and 2006, in order to evaluate the prevalence of milk contamination and its relationship with type and level of concentrate supplied. RESULTS: 132 concentrate and 85 milk samples were collected during five farm visits and analysed for aflatoxins. Aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁) was > 0.1 μg kg⁻¹ in two-thirds of the feeds and > 5 μg kg⁻¹ in nine. Contamination was higher in maize than in other pure feeds (median: 0.8 versus 0.1 μg kg⁻¹); complementary feeds showed intermediate values. Aflatoxin M₁ (AFM₁) was > 3 ng kg⁻¹ in one-third of milks and > 25 ng kg⁻¹ in three. All the milk samples were below EU statutory limits. The farm ranks for milk AFM₁ level and the peak of concentrate AFB₁ contamination were significantly correlated (0.642). CONCLUSIONS: Risk to human health was generally found to be absent, with only a few cases involving feed contamination to be monitored. The main aflatoxin risk for goat milk could arise from maize and maize-based concentrates in the more intensive breeding conditions."

Ready-to-eat (RTE) salads present a challenge in this context due to the absence of a heat treatment step before consumption. This study provides challenge-test based data of the growth characteristics of L. monocytogenes on twelve RTE salads. The food matrix, storage time and storage temperature were factors with a significant impact on the growth of L. monocytogenes. While most tested salads permitted a significant increase of L. monocytogenes in at least one of the tested conditions, no growth was observed on celeriac, carrot and corn salad products. There was a considerable increase in growth at 8 °C compared to 5 °C. Our data indicate that the reduction of the storage temperature at retail level to 5 °C and product shelf life could help mitigate the risk of L. monocytogenes in RTE salads."

Aflatoxins are potent carcinogens, produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus in peanuts, maize and some other nuts and oilseeds. Ochratoxin A is a kidney toxin and probable carcinogen. It is produced by Penicillium verrucosum in cereal grains in cold climates, by A. carbonarius in grapes, wines and vine fruits, and by A. ochraceus sometimes in coffee beans. Fumonisins, which may cause oesophageal cancer, are formed by Fusarium moniliforme and F. proliferatum, but only in maize. Trichothecenes are highly immunosuppressive and zearalenone causes oestrogenic effects; both are produced by F. graminearum and related species. Current reporting probably underestimates the effect of mycotoxins as a cause of human mortality."

Since AFM1 has been evaluated as a possible human carcinogen, the cancer risk arising from AFM1 contamination in milk is a serious problem in food safety. To evaluate the risk of AFM1 contamination in milk, it is necessary to analyze the risk factors of AFB1 contamination in corn provided for concentrated feed in Japan. The AFM1 level in domestic raw bulk milk was measured at three sampling times, January, February and June in 2004. The AFB1 contamination in corn supplied to cows was determined at the same time as the sampling of raw milk. The AFM1 contamination levels in milk in January, February and June 2004 were 0.011, 0.007 and 0.005 ng/g, respectively. The AFB1 contamination level in the corn of the concentrated feed was higher from October of 2003 to February of 2004 than from April to June in 2004. This study provides evidence that AFM1 contamination level in milk is parallel to that of AFB1 in corn of concentrated feed, so monitoring of the AFB1 level in corn is important to prevent the risk of AFM1 contamination in milk in Japan."

Currently, there is a pressing need of an efficient technology for ZEN degradation and detoxification. Because traditional physical and chemical methods could not effectively detoxify ZEN in grains, and might also affect the grain nutrients and food taste, and even result in secondary pollution, the biological technologies are developed to detoxify ZEN and its derivatives. In this paper, we reviewed the structure of ZEN and its derivatives, the fungi and bacteria species with ability of degradation of ZEN. In addition, the characterization, protein sequences and conformation of currently identified ZEN degrading enzymes, the only solved ZHD structure from Clonostachys rose were analyzed and compared, and the enzymes heterologous expression and application were also reviewed. This review will provide reference for reducing the cost of ZEN degrading enzymes by biological technologies such as enzyme engineering and fermentation engineering."

By comparing bioconcentration factors, it was found that the heavy metal concentrations accumulated in rice and maize followed a general order roots > stems or leaves > grains. An accurate and robust model for the prediction of Cd content in maize and rice grains was established based on bioconcentration factor (BCF) and the bioavailable Cd content determined by DGT method, with R2 0.986 and root mean square error (RMSE) 0.128.

Dry matter was higher in trench silos. Counts varied from not detected to 10⁸ CFU g⁻¹ in both trench silos and silo bags. Isolation frequencies of Aspergillus spp. and Fusarium spp. were higher in trench silos, whereas Penicillium spp. was higher in silo bags. Silo bags showed less diversity than trench silos. Strains isolated produced AFB₁, FB₁ and PAT. In trench silos, AFB₁ was the only mycotoxin detected (1-160 µg kg⁻¹). In silo bags AFB₁ levels varied from 5.8 to 47.4 µg kg⁻¹. DON was detected in two silo bag samples. When handling is adequate the reduction of mould and mycotoxin contamination in silo bags is considerable. This study will enable estimation of the mycotoxicological risk of different ensiling practices and determination of the most adequate method to minimize economic losses and reduce hazard to animal and human health."

However, post-PCR detection with conventional methods has limited sensitivity in amplicon separation that is crucial in multiplexing. The study aimed to develop a sensitive post-PCR detection method by using PCR-chip capillary electrophoresis (PCR-CCE) to detect and identify specific genetically modified organisms in their genomic DNA mixture by targeting event-specific nucleotide sequences. Using the PCR-CCE approach, novel multiplex methods were developed to detect MON531 cotton, EH 92-527-1 potato, Bt176 maize, GT73 canola, or GA21 maize simultaneously when their genomic DNAs in mixtures were amplified using their primer mixture. The repeatability RSD (RSDr) of the peak migration time was 0.06 and 3.88% for the MON531 and Bt176, respectively. The RSD (RSDR) of the Cry1Ac peak ranged from 0.12 to 0.40% in multiplex methods. The method was sensitive in resolving amplicon of size difference up to 4 bp. The PCR-CCE method is suitable to detect multiple genetically modified events in a composite DNA sample by tagging their event specific sequences."

Despite best efforts targeting field and storage preventive measures, environmental conditions can still lead to mycotoxin contamination. This raises a need for developing decontamination methods to inactivate or remove the toxins from contaminated products. At present, decontamination methods applied include an array of both biological and nonbiological methods. The targeted use of nonbiological methods spans from the latter half of last century, when ammoniation and ozonation were first used to inactivate mycotoxins in animal feeds, to the novel techniques being developed today such as photosensitization. Effectiveness and drawbacks of different nonbiological methods have been reported in the literature, and this review examines the utility of these methods in addressing food safety. Particular consideration is given to the application of such methods in the developing world, where mycotoxin contamination is a serious food safety issue in staple crops such as maize and rice."

Regression analysis was used to determine the significant (p < 0.05) process variables on the removal of mycotoxins from the maize. Results from this experiment indicated that hand sorting had the greatest effect on mycotoxin removal, while flotation yielded the least effect. In particular hand sorting left < 6% of aflatoxin B1 and < 5% of fumonisin B1.

Nineteen analytes were monitored, including both regulated mycotoxins, e. g. , ochratoxin A (OTA) or deoxynivalenol (DON), and non-regulated mycotoxins, such as ergot alkaloids (EAs), which are analytes that are expected to be regulated soon in the EU. Low limits of quantification (LOQ) at the part per trillion level were achieved as well as wide linear ranges (four orders of magnitude) and recovery rates within the 68-104% range. Overall, the developed method attained fit-for-purpose results and it highlights the applicability of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) detection in mycotoxin food analysis."

It was observed that at all a(w) values studied, increase in the IH CO(2) concentration generally resulted in a decrease in the colony growth rate (g, mm day(-1)) and maximum colony diameter (D(max), mm) and an increase in the lag phase duration (lambda, day).

We compared the in-field decomposition rates and diversity of decomposers colonizing residues of two Cry1Ab Bt corn hybrids, active against the European corn borer, with their non-transgenic isolines in litterbags placed in a Nebraska field. After five months, we found no significant differences in either the rates of residue mass loss or in the bacterial, fungal or micro-arthropod communities colonizing the transgenic versus the non-transgenic residues.

In conclusion, corn flour may be an essential source of AFB1 in Huai'an District, whereas high exposure to AFB1 is likely to be an important risk factor contributing to the progression of EPL."

Agricultural-product intake constitutes a principal source for As exposure in humans. In this study, the contribution of the chemical-soil parameters in As accumulation and translocation in the maize crop from a mining area of San Luis Potosi was evaluated. The total arsenic concentration and arsenic speciation were determined by HG-AFS and IC-HG-AFS, respectively. The data analysis was conducted by cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The soil pH presented a negative correlation with the accumulated As in each maize plant part, and parameters such as iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) presented a higher correlation with the As translocation in maize. Thus, the metabolic stress in maize may induce organic acid exudation leading a higher As bioavailability. A high As inorganic/organic ratio in edible maize plant tissues suggests a substantial risk of poisoning by this metalloid. Careful attention to the chemical changes in the rhizosphere of the agricultural zones that can affect As transfer through the food chain could reduce the As-intoxication risk of maize consumers."

However, the potential bioaccumulation of microplastics by plants and their effects on plants' physiology remains unexplored. Here, we evaluated the adsorption, potential uptake, and physiological effects of polyethylene (PE) microbeads in an experimental hydroponic culture of maize. Using isotope analysis, taking advantage of the different carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of fossil-derived PE and C4 plants (e. g. , maize), we estimated that about 30% of the carbon in the rhizosphere of microplastic-exposed plants was derived from PE. Still, we did not find evidence of PE translocation to the shoots. Plastic bioaccumulation in the rhizosphere caused a significant decline in transpiration, nitrogen content, and growth. Our results indicate that plastic particles may accumulate in the rhizosphere, impairing water and nutrient uptake, and eventually reaching root eaters. Due to the implications for food production and livestock feeding, our findings encourage further research on the mechanism leading to the bioaccumulation of microplastics on the surface of belowground tissues."

From the first day of pregnancy, adult rats were divided into four groups and fed with the above four diets, respectively. Weaning on postnatal day 21, the diets of offspring were consistent with their parents. The results showed that body weight, hematology, serum biochemistry, organ weight, organ coefficients and allergenicity of offspring fed with 2A-7 maize were comparable with those in the CK and BC groups. In physiological and behavioral development experiments, there was no statistically significant difference among groups. Although mCry1Ab proteins were detected in organs and serum, no histopathological changes were observed among groups. In conclusion, A-7 maize cause no treatment-related adverse effects on offspring, indicating that 2A-7 maize is safe for developing rats."

Dictionary: {}</s>",{'Corn stalk pith': ['dodecyl gallate']}</s>,"Oil pollution is causing deleterious damage to aquatic ecosystems and human health. The utilization of agricultural waste such as corn stalk (CS) to produce biosorbents has been considered an ecofriendly and efficient approach for removing oil. However, most previous studies focused on the modification of the whole CS, which is inefficient due to the heterogeneity of CS. In this study, corn stalk pith (CP), which has excellent amphipathic characteristics, was selected to prepare a high-efficiency oil sorbent by grafting dodecyl gallate (DG, a long-chain alkyl) onto CP surface lignin via laccase mediation. The modified biomass (DGCP) shows high hydrophobicity (water contact angle = 140.2°) and superoleophilicity (oil contact angle = 0°) and exhibits a high oil sorption capacity (46.43 g/g). In addition, DGCP has good stability and reusability for adsorbing oil from the aqueous phase. Kinetic and isotherm models and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy integrated with FTIR analyses revealed that the main sorption mechanism involves the H-bond effect, hydrophobic effect and van der Waals force. This work provides an ecofriendly method to prepare oil sorbents and new insights into the mechanisms underlying the removal of spilled oil from wastewater."

DON is one of the big five agriculturally important mycotoxins, resulting from Fusarium infection on grains, such as maize, barley, and wheat. In many countries, such as Canada, DON is the mycotoxin of principal concern because it can lead to major economic losses and stresses on food and feed security. The challenges discussed here include (1) understanding the different toxin profiles of Fusarium graminearum chemotypes/genotypes and the fate of these toxins upon interaction with the host crop, (2) the need for rapid analytical tests to measure DON and any masked or modified toxins in food and feed products, (3) DON exposure assessments in human populations to ensure health and safety, and (4) how contaminated food and feed products can be managed throughout the supply chain system. Despite decades of research, we are continuously learning new knowledge about DON and how best to manage it; however, there is still much work to be done.

The former is immediately consequent to pesticide application; the second occurs a short period afterward. Thus two distinct PEC (predicted environmental concentration) values were estimated, differing in time. A pilot approach was applied to the herbicide alachlor on corn in Lombardia region (northern Italy) and represents the first stage of a wider project.

Information was sought on the acute toxic effects of Bt corn pollen and the degree to which monarch larvae would be exposed to toxic amounts of Bt pollen on its host plant, the common milkweed, Asclepias syriaca, found in and around cornfields. Expression of Cry proteins, the active toxicant found in Bt corn tissues, differed among hybrids, and especially so in the concentrations found in pollen of different events. In most commercial hybrids, Bt expression in pollen is low, and laboratory and field studies show no acute toxic effects at any pollen density that would be encountered in the field. Other factors mitigating exposure of larvae include the variable and limited overlap between pollen shed and larval activity periods, the fact that only a portion of the monarch population utilizes milkweed stands in and near cornfields, and the current adoption rate of Bt corn at 19% of North American corn-growing areas. This 2-year study suggests that the impact of Bt corn pollen from current commercial hybrids on monarch butterfly populations is negligible."

We constructed a novel, low-cost device for sorting grain, the ""DropSort"", and tested its effectiveness on both plastic kernel models and fumonisin-contaminated maize. Sorting plastic kernels of known size and shape enabled us to optimize the sorting performance of the DropSort. The device sorted maize into three distinct fractions as measured by bulk density and 100-kernel weight. The level of fumonisin was lower in the heaviest fractions of maize compared to the unsorted samples. Based on correlations among fumonisin and bulk characteristics of each fraction, we found that light fraction 100-kernel weight could be an inexpensive proxy for unsorted fumonisin concentration. Single kernel analysis revealed significant relationships among kernel fumonisin content and physical characteristics that could prove useful for future sorting efforts. The availability of a low-cost device (materials~USD 300) that can be used to reduce fumonisin in maize could improve food safety in resource-limited contexts in which fumonisin contamination remains a pressing challenge."

We showed that Cd accumulates in the larvae and inhibits development by extending larval and pupal duration and decreasing the survival rate. The excretion of Cd through multiple routes during the larval and pupal stages resulted in low levels of residual Cd in the adult insects, which were not fed with Cd. However, the mating behavior and fecundity of these insects were significantly affected, compared to control insects.

In maize, fumonisins are among the toxins with the highest threatening potential because they are mainly produced by Fusarium verticillioides, which is distributed worldwide. Plant breeding has emerged as an effective and environmentally safe method to reduce fumonisin levels in maize kernels, but although phenotypic selection has proved effective for improving resistance to fumonisin contamination, further resources should be mobilized to meet farmers' needs. Selection based on molecular markers linked to quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to fumonisin contamination or/and genotype values obtained using prediction models with markers distributed across the whole genome could speed up breeding progress. Therefore, in the current paper, previously identified genomic regions, genes, and/or pathways implicated in resistance to fumonisin accumulation will be reviewed. Studies done until now have provide many markers to be used by breeders, but to get further insight on plant mechanisms to defend against fungal infection and to limit fumonisin contamination, the genes behind those QTLs should be identified."

Seventy composite samples of stored maize grains were collected from farmers’ storage structures in five agro-ecological zones (AEZs) of Nigeria where maize is predominantly produced between August 2011 and February 2012. The grains were analysed for mycotoxin contamination with the liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method and mycotoxin occurrence maps constructed from the database of the distribution of the toxins. A risk assessment was also carried out in order to provide information on the extent of human exposure to the toxins. Twelve regulated mycotoxins with negative economic and public health consequences were detected in the maize grains across the AEZs at concentrations exceeding the maximum allowable limits including AFM₁that was detected for the first time in Nigerian maize. There is a high risk of contamination of the stored grains by Nigerian consumers especially in the Derived and Southern Guinea Savannas, resulting in a national burden of between 126.85 and 38,682.29 DALYs. Intervention strategies are therefore needed across the AEZs to ensure that safe and wholesome foods are made available to the populace."

Wastewater irrigations leads to reduction in the morphological traits of the plants and reduced its vegetative biomass and yield production, with more negative impacts on maize than wheat. The concentrations of Pb, Cd, Cr, and Fe in roots and leaves of wheat were above the phytotoxic limits. Conversely, Pb, Cd, and Fe were significantly high and at phytotoxic concentrations in the leaves of maize at polluted site. The present study indicated that wheat plants tend to phytostabilize heavy metals in their roots, while maize accumulates it more in their leaves. Maize and wheat had toxic concentrations of Pb and Cd in their grains under wastewater irrigation. The health risk index showed values > 1 for Pb and Cd in polluted site for both crops, in addition to maize in unpolluted site.

HSCAS tightly and selectively adsorbs aflatoxin. In 1998, 55 dogs died in Texas after eating dog food containing aflatoxin (150-300 ppb). The corn in the diets was contaminated with aflatoxin. Six dogs were given a low-level, sub-clinical dose of aflatoxin B(1). On average, 71.5% of aflatoxin M(1) cleared within 6 h after dosing, increasing to 90.4% after 12 h. Aflatoxin M(1) was no longer detectable in urine after 48 h. Aflatoxin P(1) was not found in urine compared to large amounts of M(1) and trace amounts of Q(1). In a crossover study, six dogs randomly fed a commercial dog food (no-clay control) or coated with HSCAS (0.5% by weight) were subsequently administered a sub-clinical dose of aflatoxin B(1). Diets were switched and the process repeated. The HSCAS-coated diet significantly reduced urinary aflatoxin M(1) by 48.4%+/-16.6 SD versus the control diet. In conclusion, HSCAS protects dogs fed diets with even minimal aflatoxin contamination. Despite regular and careful ingredient screening for aflatoxin, low concentrations may reach the final product undetected. Therefore, HSCAS may provide the pet food industry further assurance of canine diet safety."

Accumulation of HMs exhibited partitioning characteristics in maize plants, i. e. Cr and Cu were accumulated mainly in root and leaf parts while Pb was concentrated in roots. The order of transfer factors (TF) of HMs in different plant organs was ordered as follows: root > stem > leaf > grain. It indicated that less HMs were accumulated in the grain compared with that in other organs. The estimate daily intakes and total target hazard quotient of HMs including Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn were less than 1, indicating that consumption of maize grain was at low risk and would not cause non-carcinogenic risks.

There were significant differences in knowledge scores among different demographic groups. Females had significantly (p < 0.05) lower knowledge scores on issues related to molds in foods. Additionally, the respondent's location had a significant effect. However, respondent's education had subtle effect on knowledge score and the overall population's knowledge score was generally low (3.55 ± 1.32 score out of 9). Results of the study underline the need to raise public's knowledge about health risks associated with spoilage molds in food and prevention and management options."

The remediation of plant microorganisms has been seen as an economical, effective, and eco-friendly method of cleaning up soils contaminated with organophosphorus pesticides. In this study, white-rot fungi were immobilized by adsorption method, a plant-microbial remediation met was established. The data results show that after 30 days, the combined remediation system for corn microbes increased the rate of chlorpyrifos degradation by 18% compared to the single remediation of the plant, and the rate of combined remediation of ryegrass microbes increased by 23%. The effect of CPF content in soil on the combined remediation is mainly reflected in the significant difference in the number of microorganisms (P < 0.05). In this article, plant-microbial remediation were applied to soil contaminated by CPF, which provides a new idea for the remediation of pesticide-contaminated soil. Combined bioremediation may be a better alternative to mitigate the impact of high pollution on microorganisms at different pollutant concentrations compared to single microbial remediation or phytoremediation."

Numerous small, cysteine-rich proteins have been shown to play a critical role in fungal-plant-bacterial associations. The discovery of six KP4-like genes in F. verticillioides precipitated efforts to understand their function and evolutionary origin. Analysis of publicly available genomic sequence identified 31 additional KP4-like genes from a range of Ascomycota, a Basidiomycota, and the moss Physcomitrella patens. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis indicate that the viral KP4 and the moss and fungal KP4-like genes evolved from a common ancestor providing evidence for lateral gene transfer between kingdoms. Six genes of the 37 total genes are predicted to encode a protein with two, non-identical KP4-like domains in tandem separated by 29-56 amino acids. The results suggest that two independent events led to the dual-domain KP4 genes present in different lineages of the Ascomycota. Understanding the nature and function of KP4-like proteins in mycotoxin-producing species like Fusarium may help to limit plant diseases and increase food safety and food production."

Given that traditional pre- and post-harvest practices lead to exposure to the environmental surroundings where pests and microorganisms may be present, maize quality and safety can be compromised severely. In order to assess the potential degree of risk, an exploratory study involving maize mycobiota from six farms from Huehuetenango, Guatemala was conducted. DNA was extracted from the maize samples, and the ITS1 region was subjected to Illumina sequencing. This survey identified 52 fungal taxa in the 90-day maize storage period. For the samples where the maize moisture content exceeded 20%, a high yeast content was observed which can reflect spoilage during storage. A significant amount of Fusarium and Aspergillus – mycotoxin-producing molds – was found, representing a potential for mycotoxin contamination. This indicates a plausible health risk in a region where maize represents a significant portion of the diet. Potential maize pathogens in the genera Acremonium and Cladosproium, and Stenocarpella maydis, were also common. Results from this study can help better understand the potential health-risk scenario in the Highlands of Guatemala if poor grain handling practices are adopted."

Fungal contamination of maize seeds decreased significantly with increasing irradiation dose. The survival curve of total fungi determined by the blotter test showed a sigmoidal pattern that can be attributed to the mixture of fungal subpopulations with different radiation sensitivities. This behaviour could be modelled well (R² = 0.995) with a modified Gompertz equation.

Evaluation included Cd accumulation and distribution in different plant tissues, bioaccumulation factor (BAF), bioconcentration factor (BCF), translocation factor (TF), and tolerance index (TI). Cadmium whole-plant uptake was only affected by the CdCl₂ rate; the highest uptake was obtained with 2 mg·kg-1 CdCl₂ (34.4 g·ha-1) (p < 0.05). Cadmium distribution in the maize plant usually exhibited the highest accumulation in the straw (p < 0.05), independently of the environment, Cd rate, and evaluated cultivar.

Each significant SNP was calculated and the SNPs significant associated with kernels, axes, stems, bracts and leaves explained 6.96%-10.56%, 7.19%-15.87%, 7.11%-10.19%, 7.16%-8.71% and 6.91%-9.17% of the phenotypic variation, respectively. Among the significant SNPs, nine co-localised with previously detected quantitative trait loci. This study will aid in the selection of Hg-accumulation inbred lines that satisfy the needs for pollution-safe cultivars and maintaining maize production."

Etiology of disease was markedly different between compounds. Increased RDX exposure caused an inverse relationship to time of death, symptoms including clonic followed by tonic convulsions, and death shortly thereafter. Brain concentrations of RDX postmortem, however, were relatively consistent (mean +/- standard error, 20.5 +/- 2.9 mg/kg tissue). Observations of 2,6-DNT effects included gastrointestinal distress, dehydration, and a reduction in body mass and feed consumption. Together, these data suggest that RDX is more toxic from short, repeated exposures than 2,6-DNT, resulting in central nervous system-related effects, whereas 2,6-DNT causes gastrointestinal disturbances at higher exposures."

Silage is green forage preserved by lactic fermentation under anaerobic conditions. This ecosystem maintains its quality and nutritional value depending on interactions among physical, chemical and biological agents. Forages used for ensilage are naturally in contact with yeasts and filamentous fungi, and the contamination often occurs in the field and can also occur during harvesting, transport, storage. Moreover, postharvest poor management can lead to a rapid spoilage. Studies on fungal contamination of dairy cattle feed have shown how corn silage influences the contamination degree of feed supplied to livestock. Increasing knowledge in this area will help elucidate the influence that this microbiota exerts on production and/or degradation of mycotoxins present in silage.

Furthermore, distinctive mullite was detected in the soil which confirmed the contribution of high temperature smelting to PTEs pollution.

The PAH removal from ash-treated soil was compared with PAHs-spiked soil. The removal of 16 individual PAHs from soil ranged between 4.8% and 87.8% within the experiment. The natural attenuation approach led to a negligible total PAH removal. The phytoremediation was the most efficient approach for PAH removal, while the highest removal was observed in the case of ash-treated soil. The content of low molecular weight (LMW) PAHs and the total PAHs in this treatment significantly decreased (P <.05) over the whole experiment by 47.6% and 29.4%, respectively. The tested level of PAH soil contamination (~1600 µg PAH/kg soil dry weight) had no adverse effects on maize growth as well on the biomass yield. In addition, the PAHs were detected only in maize roots and their bioaccumulation factors were significantly lower than 1 suggesting negligible PAH uptake from soil by maize roots. The results showed that PAHs of ash origin were similarly susceptible to removal as spiked PAHs. The presence of maize significantly boosted the PAH removal from soil and its aboveground biomass did not represent any environmental risk."

Therefore, the demand for achieving sensitive detection of FB1 is becoming more and more pressing. In the present study, a creative biosensor for FB1 detection was developed based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer between upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and graphene oxide (GO) with catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) target recycling and amplification. In the presence of FB1, UCNPs were bound to the CHA amplification products away from the GO surface. Simultaneously, a strong fluorescence signal was produced at 980 nm (near-infrared light). The correlation between the concentration of FB1 and the fluorescence intensity exhibited a high relevance (R2 = 0.9971) ranging from 0.032 to 500 ng mL-1, and the method reached a considerably low limit of detection (0.0121 ng mL-1). It could be applied for the detection of FB1 in corn, oats, and infant supplements. The sensitive detection of FB1 proves the application potential of this method on food safety detection. This biosensor can enable high-throughput fungal toxin detection by allowing the use of various aptamers."

Cassava cultivation has been expanding recently at the global scale and is widely consumed in most regions of South America, Africa, and Asia. However, it is also characterized by the presence in its roots of potentially toxic hydrocyanic acid. Furthermore, cassava can also absorb pollutants as it is currently cultivated near roads or factories and generally without consideration for potential sources of soil, water, or atmospheric pollution. Careful washing, peeling, and adequate preparation before eating are therefore crucial steps for reducing human exposure to both environmental pollutants and natural hydrocyanic acid.

Synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy showed that EA reduced the polarity of zein around tyrosine residues, which were exposed to a more hydrophobic microenvironment.

A daily consumption questionnaire was used to determine the consumption of corn tortillas and a frequency questionnaire to determine the consumption of other corn products. A book of photographs was used to adjust criteria on the size of the portions of corn products and a probability distribution was built of the weight and content of corn for tortillas. Probability density functions (PDFs) were used to describe the consumption of each corn product. Men and those between 14 and 65 years old have the highest consumption of tortillas. Tortillas, antojitos, tacos and chilaquiles are the products that provide the largest amount of corn to the Veracruz people's diet. Even though these products are nixtamalisated, there is evidence that after a thermo-alkaline process some contaminants such as mycotoxins (like aflatoxin, which is a mutagenic, teratogenic and carcinogenic toxin) could be present in high concentrations. These results highlight the need to characterise the consumption of one of the main foods included in dietary staple in Mexico as a first step for a probabilistic risk assessment."

MWCNT coexposure decreased chlordane and DDx accumulation 21-80% across all crops, depending on species and nanotube concentration. Conversely, C60 had species- and contaminant-specific effects on pesticide uptake, ranging from complete suppression of DDx uptake (corn/tomato) to 34.9% increases in chlordane accumulation (tomato/soybean).

Exposure to excess estrogen, in both natural and synthetic forms, has been implicated as a risk factor for the development of this disease. Considerable interest has been focused on organochlorines, such as the triazine herbicides, and their possible role in the initiation or promotion of human breast cancer. To explore this relationship, an ecologic study of Kentucky counties was designed. Exposure to triazines was estimated by use of water contamination data, corn crop production, and pesticide use data. A summary index of triazine herbicide exposure was developed to classify counties into low, medium, or high exposure levels. Data on county breast cancer rates were obtained from the state registry. A Poisson regression analysis was performed, controlling for age, race, age at first live birth, income, and level of education. Results revealed a statistically significant increase in breast cancer risk with medium and high levels of triazine exposure [odds ratio (OR) = 1.14,p<0.0001 and OR = 1.2, p<0.0001, respectively]. The results suggest a relationship between exposure to triazine herbicides and increased breast cancer risk, but conclusions concerning causality cannot be drawn, due to the limitations inherent in ecologic study design."

DON affects animal and human health causing vomiting, acute temporary nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and fever. In this study, a total of 96 wheat flour samples of different types were collected during summer 2013 from six flour mills in Northern Iran. All samples were analyzed for DON by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. DON was detected in 80 out of 96 wheat flour samples (83.33%), at levels ranging from 23 to 1270 µg/kg. The maximum contamination level of DON (1270 μg/kg) was found in whole flour while the minimum value (23 μg/kg) was registered in debranned flour. The mean of contamination was 630.53 µg/kg. According to results obtained, incidence and contamination levels of DON, seem to be a serious problem for public health. Therefore, cereal and cereal based foods should be controlled for the presence of toxins, storage conditions and moisture content, which is considered a major factor in the growth of the Fusarium fungi."

At the same time, the demand for healthier products continues to grow, as today's consumers are increasingly concerned about their health and well-being. To meet this demand, traditional products have been reformulated to achieve a healthier nutritional profile. In this context, the aim of this study was to understand the sensory and hedonic perception of Brazilian consumers toward salty snacks. Sixty-one consumers answered a Check-all-that-apply (CATA) questionnaire, followed by an acceptance test and an attitudinal questionnaire. Four traditional salty snacks and one fit snack were sampled. The results showed that both the fit snack and the traditional snacks were well accepted by consumers. According to CATA questionnaire, the samples presented a completely different sensory profile, describing their ideal snack as: crispy, homogeneous, little cheese aroma, corn flavor, sweet residual taste and little salty taste. In addition, the attitudinal questionnaire indicated that consumers want products that bring health benefits, while maintaining their pleasant flavor and affordable price. These findings highlight that understanding consumers' desires can help new products succeed in the marketplace and also aid in marketing strategies to be used."

To identify the hub gene responsible for Pb tolerance in maize, we performed a trait-associated co-expression network analysis at a genome-wide level, using two maize lines with contrasting Pb tolerances. Finally, ZmNRAMP6 that encodes a metal transporter was identified as the hub gene among the Pb tolerance-associated co-expression module. Heterologous expression of ZmNRAMP6 in yeast verified its role in Pb transport. Combined Arabidopsis overexpression and maize mutant analysis suggested that ZmNRAMP6 conferred plant sensitivity to Pb stress by transporting Pb ion from the roots to shoots. Knockout of ZmNRAMP6 caused Pb retention in the roots and activation of the antioxidant enzyme system, resulting in an increased Pb tolerance in maize. An integration of yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase reporter assay uncovered that ZmNRAMP6 was negatively regulated by a known Pb tolerance-related transcript factor ZmbZIP54. Different from the other known NRAMP genes, ZmNRAMP6 acted as a Pb transporter from the roots to shoots and environment.

Aflatoxin B1 and fumonisin B1 were quantified in 67.1 and 92.9% of the grains, while 64.1 and 57.1% exceeded the European Union Commission maximum acceptable limit (MAL) for aflatoxin B1 and fumonisins, respectively. The concentration of deoxynivalenol was, however, below the MAL with occurrence levels of 100 and 10% for its masked metabolite, deoxynivalenol glucoside. The bacterial metabolites had low concentrations and were not a source of concern. The storage structures significantly correlated positively or negatively (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05), respectively with the levels of grain contamination. Consumption of maize grains, a staple Nigerian diet, may therefore expose the population to mycotoxin contamination. There is need for an immediate action plan for mycotoxin mitigation in Nigeria, especially in the Derived Savannah zone, in view of the economic and public health importance of the toxins."

OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3 were highly permeable to arsenite in Xenopus oocyte assays. Both transporters were localized at the plasma membrane. Knockout of either gene had little effect on arsenite uptake or translocation. Overexpression of OsNIP1;1 or OsNIP3;3 in rice did not affect arsenite uptake but decreased root-to-shoot translocation of arsenite and shoot arsenic concentration markedly. The overexpressed OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3 proteins were localized in all root cells without polarity. Expression of OsNIP1;1 driven by the OsLsi1 promoter produced similar effects. When grown in two arsenic-contaminated paddy soils, overexpressing lines contained significantly lower arsenic concentration in rice grain than the wild-type without compromising plant growth or the accumulation of essential nutrients. Overexpression of OsNIP1;1 or OsNIP3;3 provides a route for arsenite to leak out of the stele, thus restricting arsenite loading into the xylem. This strategy is effective in reducing arsenic accumulation in rice grain."

Upon specific recognition of aptamer toward OTA, the anchored probe was released from the sensing interface into the reaction solution. In this circumstance, the increased amount of the signal probe in reaction solution led to an enhanced fluorescence response, while the decreased amount of the signal probe on the sensing interface resulted in a diminished electrochemical response.

Its high protein content makes it a preferred ingredient in feed. Given the high prevalence of mycotoxins in maize globally, they pose a significant challenge to use of MGM for feed: wet milling could concentrate certain mycotoxins in gluten components, and mycotoxin consumption affects animal health and can contaminate animal-source foods. To help confront this issue, this paper summarizes mycotoxin occurrence in maize, distribution during MGM production and mycotoxin risk management strategies for MGM through a comprehensive literature review. Available data emphasize the importance of mycotoxin control in MGM and the necessity of a systematic control approach, which includes: good agriculture practices (GAP) in the context of climate change, degradation of mycotoxin during MGM processing with SO2 and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and the prospect of removing or detoxifying mycotoxins using emerging technologies. In the absence of mycotoxin contamination, MGM represents a safe and economically critical component of global animal feed. With a holistic risk assessment-based, seed-to-MGM-feed systematic approach to reducing and decontaminating mycotoxins in maize, costs and negative health impacts associated with MGM use in feed can be effectively reduced."

There have been recent increases in using 2,4-D products in a combination with other herbicides such as metribuzin and acetochlor to control noxious weeds. However, accurate analysis of 2,4-D isooctyl ester remains to be improved due to long analysis time and rapid conversion of the ester to acid (i. e. , under-reporting residues). In this work, a simple hydrolysis procedure was introduced to provide a quantitative hydrolytic rate of the ester (>95%) and did not affect the other pH-sensitive compounds. Analysis parameters and sample pretreatments were optimized for improved selectivity and accuracy. The hydrolysis-QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) technique for multidetermination of 2,4-D isooctyl ester, metribuzin, acetochlor, and 2-ethyl-6-methylaniline in corn and soybeans via high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was established. The method had average recoveries of 74-109% with relative standard deviations ≤13.5% and limits of quantifications (LOQs) of 0.05 mg/kg. The terminal residues of these compounds found in real edible matrixes were less than the corresponding LOQs at harvest time. The risk quotients were far below 100%, indicating a low health risk to consumers."

We developed social network models to analyze the association between nations' aflatoxin regulations and global trade patterns of pistachios from 1996-2010. The main pistachio producing countries are Iran and the United States (US), which together contribute to nearly 75% of the total global pistachio market. Over this time period, during which many nations developed or changed their aflatoxin regulations in pistachios, global pistachio trade patterns changed; with the US increasingly exporting to countries with stricter aflatoxin standards. The US pistachio crop has had consistently lower levels of aflatoxin than the Iranian crop over this same time period.

In this study, TCDD was intercalated in the smectite clay saponite by an incipient wetness method. The primary goal of this study was to intercalate TCDD in natural K-saponite clay and evaluate its immunotoxic effects in vivo. The relative bioavailability of TCDD was evaluated by comparing the metabolic activity of TCDD administered in the adsorbed state as an intercalate in saponite and freely dissolved in corn oil. This comparison revealed nearly identical TCDD-induced suppression of humoral immunity, a well-established and sensitive sequela, in a mammalian (mouse) model. This result suggests that TCDD adsorbed by clays is likely to be available for biouptake and biodistribution in mammals, consistent with previous observations of TCDD in livestock exposed to dioxin-contaminated ball clays that were used as feed additives. Adsorption of TCDD by clay minerals does not appear to mitigate risk associated with TCDD exposure substantially."

The results of the estimated daily intake showed that the regular consumption of rice and maize crops containing the highest Cd, Mo, Pb and Zn concentrations could pose a serious threat to human health, because the daily intake of Cd, Mo, Pb and Zn for crops grown in the fields around the Zletovska River exceeded the recommended provisional tolerable daily intake values. Taking into account the results, the area around Zletovska River is considered as the most anthropogenically impacted part of Kočani Field."

Aflatoxin testing protects consumer health, ensures the safe global trade of corn, and verifies compliance with legislation; however, effective sampling procedures are essential to ensure reliable results. While many sampling procedures exist, there is no evidence to indicate which is the best approach to ensure accurate detection. Using scientific and gray literature sources, this review analyzed sampling procedures to determine an optimum approach to guide the development of standard practices. Results revealed that sampling is the major source of error in the accurate assessment of aflatoxin levels in food and crucial for obtaining reliable results. To guarantee low variability and sample bias-increased sample size and sampling frequency, the use of automatic dynamic sampling techniques, adequate storage, and homogenization of aggregate samples for analysis are advised to ensure a representative sample. However, there is a lack of evidence to support this or indicate the current utilization of the reviewed procedures. Inadequate data prevented the recommendation of sample sizes or frequency for optimum practice, and thus, further research is required. There is an urgent need to make sampling procedures fit-for-purpose to obtain accurate and reliable aflatoxin measurements."

Chromatographic time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay offered a magnified positive signal and low signal-to-noise ratio in time-resolved mode due to the absence of noise interference caused by excitation light sources. Compared with the immunosensing performance in previous studies, this platform demonstrated a wider dynamic range of 0.2-60 μg/kg, lower limit of detection from 0.06 to 0.12 µg/kg, and considerable recovery from 80.5% to 116.7% for different food and feed sample matrices.

In Croatia, research on mycotoxins focused on OTA when the mycotoxin theory of endemic nephropathy (EN) was postulated. Ochratoxin A was more frequent and at higher concentration in foods from EN than those from the control regions. Subsequently, OTA concentrations were determined in some commodities intended for human consumption such as maize, wheat, beans and wine. Samples from all parts of Croatia were analyzed and OTA was found in all types of commodities. It was frequently found together with other mycotoxins (fumonisin B(1), fumonisin B(2) and zearalenone). In general, OTA concentration in foods from Croatia is low, but the frequency of positive samples shows considerable variations from year to year depending also on sampling location. Although low levels of OTA were found in a large proportion of analyzed food samples, its persistent co-occurrence with other significant mycotoxins should raise serious public health concerns as there interactions may be synergistic or additive in causing toxicity in humans and animals.

In this paper, a split-type photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunoassay was designed for sensitive detection of AFB1 in foodstuffs by using amorphous TiO2 with all-inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (CsPbBr3/a-TiO2). The a-TiO2 layer not only improved the stability of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, but also facilitated charge transfer, which resulted in the increasing photocurrent of the nanocomposites. Initially, a competitive-type enzyme immunoreaction was executed on a high-binding microplate between the analyte and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-labeled AFB1-bovine serum albumin (AFB1-BSA) conjugate. Accompanied by the formation of the immunocomplex, the carried ALP triggered enzymatic hydrolysis to generate ascorbic acid (AA, as an electron donor) for increasing the photocurrent of the CsPbBr3/a-TiO2-modified electrode. Coupling with the competitive enzyme immunoassay, the photocurrent of the modified electrode decreased with the increase of target AFB1 concentration in a dynamic working range from 0.01 ng mL-1 to 15 ng mL-1 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.8 pg mL-1 under optimum conditions. Furthermore, the photoelectrochemical immunoassay was also utilized to detect AFB1 in peanut and corn samples, giving acceptable accuracy in comparison with the referenced AFB1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method."

Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used for detection. Recoveries were >60% in both cereals, even if the matrix effects were not negligible. The limits of quantification of the method results were comparable to those obtained by other two magnetic SPE-based methods applied to cereals, which were limited to one or two mycotoxins, whereas in this work the investigated mycotoxins belonged to three different chemical classes."

These studies indicate that K49 and NRRL 21882 are superior to AF36 in reducing total aflatoxin contamination. Neither K49 nor NRRL 21882 produce CPA and when challenged with K54 and F3W4, CPA and aflatoxins were reduced by 84-97% and 83-98%, respectively. In contrast, AF36 reduced aflatoxins by 20% with F3W4 and 93% with K54 and showed no reduction in CPA with F3W4 and only a 62% reduction in CPA with K54. Because AF36 produces CPA, high levels of CPA accumulate when maize is inoculated with AF36 alone or in combination with F3W4 or K54.

In this study, portable hyperspectral imaging in the visible near-infrared (VNIR) spectral range (400-1000 nm) was applied as a rapid tool to detect adulteration in quinoa flour. Quinoa flour was adulterated with wheat, rice, soybean, and corn in the range of 0-98% with 2% increments.

Although authorities may set maximum levels, these regulations are not effective in subsistence farming communities. As maize is consumed in large quantities, exposure to mycotoxins will surpass safe levels even where the contamination levels are below the regulated maximum levels. It is clear that the lowering of exposure in these communities requires an integrated approach. Detailed understanding of agricultural practices, mycotoxin occurrence, climate change/weather patterns, human exposure and risk are warranted to guide adequate intervention programmes. Risk communication and creating awareness in affected communities are also critical. A range of biologically based products for control of mycotoxigenic fungi and mycotoxins in maize have been developed and commercialised.

To minimise consumer exposure to mycotoxins, the levels of deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZON) in cereals/cereal products and fumonisins B(1) and B(2) (FB(1) and FB(2)) in maize are controlled by European Union legislation. Relatively few studies, however, have examined the loss of Fusarium mycotoxins during processing. The behaviour of FB(1), FB(2) and fumonisin B(3) (FB(3)), DON and ZON during extrusion of naturally contaminated maize flour and maize grits is examined using pilot-scale equipment. DON and ZON are relatively stable during extrusion cooking but the fumonisins are lost to varying degrees. There is some loss of ZON when present in low concentrations and extruded at higher moisture contents. The presence of additives, such as reducing sugars and sodium chloride, can also affect mycotoxin levels. Moisture content of the cereal feed during extrusion is important and has a greater effect than temperature, particularly on the loss of fumonisins at the lower moistures. The effects are complex and not easy to explain, although more energy input to the extruder is required for drier materials. However, on the basis of these studies, the relationship between the concentration of Fusarium toxins in the raw and finished product is toxin- and process-dependent."

Aflatoxin contamination was detected in 49% of samples and was above the regulatory (10 ppb) in 15% of the samples overall; 65% of samples from a drought-prone area were over the limit. In a detailed survey in Bungoma County, we investigated aflatoxin and fumonisin contamination in four popular maize varieties at harvest and after 2 and 4 months of storage. We collected whole-grain samples from farmers' storage sheds and milled samples from patrons of local mills. Mean aflatoxin contamination was identical for storage sheds and mills at 2.3 ppb. In all, 41% of the samples from mills had detectable aflatoxin, with 4% over the regulatory limit, whereas 87% had detectable fumonisin, with 50% over the regulatory limit (1 ppm). Mean contamination levels did not change during storage. Maize varieties differed in fumonisin contamination, with the most popular varieties vulnerable to both mycotoxins and weevils, which are potential factors in exacerbating mycotoxin contamination. Mycotoxin surveillance is important not just in areas known previously for aflatoxin contamination and acute poisoning but also is needed in all maize-producing regions."

A field experiment was conducted at a tropical site in Hainan Province, China, that had been subjected to soil pollution by Cd and Pb from past mining activities. There were ten treatment groups comprising a mixture of biochar, hydroxyapatite (HAP), manure, and plant ash in varying proportions and at three different rates. Compared with untreated soil, all treatments increased pH by 2-3 units in bulk soil or 1-2 units in rhizosphere soil. For all amendments, the concentration of Cd in all parts of maize plants was decreased compared with unamended soil, but this effect was much smaller for Pb. The greatest effect was found with a mixture containing the ratio of HAP:manure:biochar:plant ash as 6:4:2:1 when applied at 20.1 t ha-1. The dominant microbial group in contaminated soil was Proteobacteria. There is evidence that this group can immobilize Cd by mechanisms that include biosorption and bioprecipitation. It was concluded that the mixed amendments containing biochar, HAP, manure, and plant ash can be useful in decreasing Cd uptake by maize. The amendment in this study likely operates through a combination of soil chemical changes and by influencing the soil-microbe-plant interaction."

Models were development using 332 cases collected between 1998 and 2001. Thirty cases collected in 2002 were used to validate the models. Preplanting data showed a strong relationship with late-season gray leaf spot severity classes. The most important predictors were SR, PD, GLSR, and LON. Logistic regression models correctly classified 60 to 70% of the validation cases, whereas the CART models correctly classified 57 to 77% of these cases. Cases misclassified by the CART models were mostly due to overestimation, whereas the logistic regression models tended to misclassify cases by underestimation. Both the CART and logistic regression models have potential as management decision-making tools. Early quantitative assessment of gray leaf spot risk would allow for more sound management decisions being made when warranted."

Cocktails of antibiotics were investigated in potato, corn, carrot, tomato, lettuce, and wheat. Among them, corn exhibited relatively high median concentrations of antibiotics (0.400-203 μg/kg dry weight).

Pathologic examinations were conducted including examinations for parasites and bacteria. Due to public health significance, a screening for Salmonella sp. , as well as real-time polymerase chain reaction examinations for Campylobacter sp. and Mycobacterium avium ssp. avium, were done. Because pesticides and land-usage can possibly influence bird numbers, the birds were screened for environmental toxin residues, including neonicotinoid insecticides, and land-usage data were correlated with the hunting bags. The result was a very-strong positive correlation of set-aside areas and a less-strong negative correlation of maize cultivation acreage. More than 90% of the birds had a good health status; only individuals showed pathologic alterations. For example, avian tuberculosis was found in two pheasants and a severe capillariosis in two partridges. A possible role of female reproductive disorders has to be confirmed in further investigations. In conclusion, results suggest the decrease of set-aside areas could be a possible reason for decline."

SSB, regardless of temperature, was effective in immobilizing non-essential HMs for plants, such as Cd, Co, Cr and Pb, in the soil. On the other hand, SSB was able to supply micronutrients to corn plants after amendment ceased.

Comparative transcriptome analysis between the OE/RNAi and wild-type lines revealed that ZmAKINβγ1 participated in the pectin metabolism process and nitrogen compound response. Gene-based association analyses revealed that three variants located in ZmAKINβγ1 promoter induced changes in its expression and Pb tolerance among maize lines.

However, maize incurs considerable losses both in field and storage due to pathogens and insects. Some of the pathogens and resultant mycotoxins reduce the nutritional quality of the product. Mycotoxins are toxigenic fungal compounds that can cause cancer and suppress growth. In spite of this health hazard, there has been very little research to document their occurrence. Maize grains stored for human consumption were sampled from different agro-ecosystems (forest, valley and plateau areas) of three agroecological zones (high, mid and low altitude). RESULTS: Several fungal genera were recovered among which Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Fusarium verticillioides, F. solani, Rhizopus stolonifer and Penicillium spp. were prevalent. The weevil Sitophilus zeamais and the larger grain borer Prostephanus truncatus were the most damaging. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests yielded fumonisins and aflatoxins ranging between 0.02 and 21.44 ppm, and 0.7 and 108.39 ppb in 96.4% and 21.4% of samples, respectively. Fumonisin was more pronounced in villages in forest areas whereas aflatoxin was highest in valley and forest areas in Zone II. CONCLUSION: Strategic interventions to curtail fungal, mycotoxin and insect contamination should be directed towards improved agronomic and post-harvest practices of maize from fields to consumers."

Chloroform and other trihalomethanes have been shown to increase tumours of the liver, kidney or large intestine in rats or mice. The risk to man from these contaminants must be assessed carefully since there is considerable benefit associated with the use of chlorine. The weight of evidence suggests that chloroform is non-genotoxic and there are data, for each site, to indicate that tumours only occur at high doses where there is also tissue damage. Bromodichloromethane has also been shown to increase liver and kidney tumours but this and bromoform have been shown to increase large intestinal tumours in rats. The weight of evidence is that they are only weak genotoxins and they do not appear to be active in vivo. It is probable that the mechanism for the liver and kidney tumours is the same as for chloroform but the mechanism for the large intestinal tumours is uncertain. However, the toxicity and carcinogenicity of these substances is profoundly affected by dosing in corn oil. New studies suggest that dosing in drinking water would not result in increases in tumours. The evidence suggests that the use of a threshold approach, based on a tolerable daily intake, would be the most appropriate way of determining safe levels in drinking water."

We then quantified the metal assimilation efficiency (AE) in a juvenile marine fish blackhead seabream Acanthopagrus schlegelii using a radiotracer technique to assess the dietary bioavailability of cadmium (Cd), inorganic mercury (Hg(II)), and zinc (Zn). Different sources of protein in artificial diets did not significantly affect the metal AEs, except for Hg(II) from corn meal and Zn from corn meal and rapeseed meal.

After extraction of the corn flakes' residue with 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) solution and hydrolysis with 2 N potassium hydroxide, hidden (protein bound) fumonisin was determined as HFB(1), which was found in residues from all the corn flakes samples, even those containing no detectable FB(1); the average concentration of HFB(1) was 101 ng g(-1), equivalent to 180 ng FB(1) g(-1). Thus, our results showed an average of 2.6 times more FB(1) present in bound form as was determined by conventional analysis. We found a correlation coefficient of -0.5034 for a logarithmic relationship between the FB(1) (C(18) clean-up) and HFB(1) concentrations The highest concentration of HFB(1) formed was 288 ng g(-1) from a sample containing only 12-15 ng FB(1) g(-1), while the lowest concentration of HFB(1) was 26 ng g(-1) from a sample with 152-155 ng FB(1) g(-1). This low degree of correlation should be taken into account by food safety authorities in estimates of human exposure to protein bound fumonisin."

The starch amount was maximized, and this was achieved by adding polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and also polyurethane (PU) to the formulation. The PU acted as plasticizer and also provided functional groups that interacted with the natamycin and affected its diffusion. When 5 % PU was added, the natamycin migration of the coating doped with 1% natamycin was reduced by half. The natamycin distribution on both sides of the film was also evaluated, concluding that, in line with the reduced migration, when polyurethane is included, the formulation presents high hydrophobicity and natamycin is left with a preferential distribution towards the air face (exterior). For microbiological tests, microorganisms were isolated from cheese factories. Natamycin solutions showed inhibitory effect against environmental molds including Penicillium spp. Accordingly, films loaded with 0.1 % natamycin showed a significant inhibitory effect against Penicillium spp. The polymer combination in this work was optimized to obtain an active coating with good physicochemical properties and enriched with natamycin that has proven to be available for acting against molds and preferentially on the surface exposed to potential mold attack during ripening."

Fresh maize was harvested at different stages of maturity, blanched, smoked, and sun dried before milling into flours that were blended with soy flours for preparation of test porridges. The test flours were analyzed using the Association of the Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) methods to determine their nutrient composition before preparation of the porridges. A trained consumer panel of 12 people, mothers and nursery school children tasted the porridges to rank acceptability and preference. Analysis of nutritional data showed that the test flours contained similar amounts of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates as the commonly used dried maize-soy flour blends. All the test porridges were generally accepted by the mothers and children due to the unique smoky and roasted aroma, brown color and the sweeter flavor even without the addition of sugar. Grainy texture and the presence of residues were the only unacceptable attributes in some of the test porridges. In conclusion, fresh maize-soy floor blends can be potentially used in complementary feeding of children at home and school as an alternative to other traditional maize flours. Optimization and fortification can help make the flours nutrient-dense and most appropriate for child feeding at scale."

When comparing the results for all soils, the highest adsorption corresponded to those more acidic and with high organic matter and non-crystalline minerals contents. The best adjustment to adsorption models corresponded to Freundlich's. AMX desorption was generally <10%; specifically, the maximum was 6.5% in forest soils, and 16.9% in agricultural soils.

The results were compared to those of low-sulfur reformulated gasoline (RFG) in a functionally equivalent automobile. Two time frames were evaluated, one near-term (2010), which examines converting a dedicated energy crop (switchgrass) and an agricultural residue (corn stover) to ethanol; and one midterm (2020), which assumes technological improvements in the switchgrass-derived ethanol life cycle. Near-term results show that, compared to a RFG automobile, life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are 57% lower for an E85-fueled automobile derived from switchgrass and 65% lower for ethanol from corn stover, on a grams of CO2 equivalent per kilometer basis. Corn stover ethanol exhibits slightly lower life cycle GHG emissions, primarily due to sharing emissions with grain production. Through projected improvements in crop and ethanol yields, results for the mid-term scenario show that GHG emissions could be 25-35% lower than those in 2010 and that, even with anticipated improvements in RFG automobiles, E85 automobiles could still achieve up to 70% lower GHG emissions across the life cycle."

The PPEI is based on a number of factors including: human population centers and their proximity to agricultural crops, the toxicological properties of pesticides, and their application frequency. The index was applied to a region in southern Ecuador (approximately 7200 km2 ) where corn, rice, and sugarcane are the predominant crops, and where hot spots with the highest vulnerability to pesticide residues were identified. Of the total of 5326 neighborhoods for the entire study area, 1030 had high, 1124 had medium, and 1009 had low PPEI scores. Among the practical uses of PPEI are to help to assist regulatory agencies and academics evaluate the effects of land use policies on pesticide vulnerability. Also, it can be easily expanded to include other parameters, such as data from other agricultural crops, or frequency of pesticide application.

Forages can be contaminated with several mycotoxins in the field pre-harvest, during storage, or after ensiling during feed-out. Exposure to dietary mycotoxins adversely affects the performance and health of livestock and can compromise human health. Several studies and surveys indicate that ruminants are often exposed to mycotoxins such as aflatoxins, trichothecenes, ochratoxin A, fumonisins, zearalenone, and many other fungal secondary metabolites, via the silage they ingest. Problems associated with mycotoxins in silage can be minimized by preventing fungal growth before and after ensiling. Proper silage management is essential to reduce mycotoxin contamination of dairy cow feeds, and certain mold-inhibiting chemical additives or microbial inoculants can also reduce the contamination levels. Several sequestering agents also can be added to diets to reduce mycotoxin levels, but their efficacy varies with the type and level of mycotoxin contamination. This article gives an overview of the types, prevalence, and levels of mycotoxin contamination in ensiled forages in different countries, and describes their adverse effects on health of ruminants, and effective prevention and mitigation strategies for dairy cow diets.

Due to poor farming practices in this area, it is possible that aflatoxin B1 is somehow transported from soil to the corn ears. This study was carried out to detect and quantify aflatoxin B1 in corn and corn-grown soils in Anuradhapura. Corn (n = 60) and corn-grown soil (n = 60) samples were randomly collected from 20 minor-scale corn-grown fields with three random replicates. Each sample was prepared for the measurement of aflatoxin B1 levels using the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Though 20 ppb is considered as the poisonous or deleterious level for corn consumption, there were toxin contaminations of up to 60-70 ppb in the corn kernel, while majority of soil had 350-400 ppb of aflatoxin B1 levels. Fifteen corn samples had exceeded the acceptable level while 22 samples were free of aflatoxin B1 and 23 samples were within the acceptable level. The results showed that the presence of aflatoxin B1 in corn is not habitually distributed throughout Anuradhapura district and it increased with the soil aflatoxin B1 concentration.

In this work, we have developed a competitive upconversion-linked immunosorbent assay (ULISA) for the analysis of zearalenone (ZEA), one of the most frequently encountered mycotoxins in food worldwide. Instead of a toxin-conjugate conventionally used in competitive immunoassays, we designed a ZEA mimicking peptide extended by a biotin-linker and confirmed its excellent suitability to mimic ZEA by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP, type NaYF4:Yb,Tm) served as background-free optical label for the detection of the peptide mimetic in the competitive ULISA. Streptavidin-conjugated UCNPs were prepared by click reaction using an alkyne-PEG-neridronate linker. The UCNP conjugate clearly outperformed conventional labels such as enzymes or fluorescent dyes. With a limit of detection of 20 pg mL-1 (63 pM), the competitive ULISA is well applicable to the detection of ZEA at the levels set by the European legislation. Moreover, the ULISA is specific for ZEA and its metabolites (α- and β-zearalenol) without significant cross-reactivity with other related mycotoxins.

Corn grits are used by the food industry to produce a large variety of corn products such as canjiquinha, a cultural food easily purchased by the Brazilian consumer at low prices. Some studies have demonstrated high contamination of this product by aflatoxins (AFs), representing a potential risk of exposure due to such a contamination. In this study, the efficacy of gaseous ozonation was evaluated on the levels of aflatoxins and on the microbial contamination of corn grits. The application of gaseous ozone was tested in different combinations of exposure time, ozone concentration, and canjiquinha mass. After the ozonation treatment, samples were collected for aflatoxin and microbiological analyses. Aflatoxins were evaluated using a high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD) system using pre-column derivatization, and the microbiological analyses were carried out for toxin-producer fungi and mesophilic bacteria. After ozone detoxification, results showed reductions up to 57% in aflatoxin levels. Total fungal count was reduced around 3.0 cycles log CFU g-1 and total mesophilic counts were reduced to non-detectable levels. These results demonstrated that ozonation is an effective alternative for reducing aflatoxin and microbial contamination in products like canjiquinha, thereby improving food safety."

For PQ detection, the MIP could achieve three orders of magnitude better than the limit of detection, and one order of magnitude wider detection range than existing methods. The PQ recovery values for real samples of water and corn were 96.4-102.1% and 93.9-97.3%, respectively. The amount of PQ detected by the MIP was within 98.05% on average of that using high-performance liquid chromatography. For PQ adsorption, the MIP had an adsorption capacity of 3.36 mg/g, and followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model with excellent toxicological characteristics.

In this paper, we assess the potential transfer of diet-derived DNA to animal tissues after consumption of GM plants. Blood, spleen, liver, kidney and muscle tissues from piglets fed for 35 days with diets containing either GM (MON810) or a conventional maize were investigated for the presence of plant DNA. Only fragments of specific maize genes (Zein, Sh-2) could be detected with different frequencies in all the examined tissues except muscle. A small fragment of the Cry1A(b) transgene was detected in blood, liver, spleen and kidney of the animals raised with the transgenic feed. The intact Cry1A(b) gene or its minimal functional unit were never detected. Statistical analysis of the results showed no difference in recovery of positives for the presence of plant DNA between animals raised with the transgenic feed and animals raised with the conventional feed, indicating that DNA transfer may occur independently from the source and the type of the gene.

An opposite behaviour was observed in the acid KPD soil. All amendments, when added to KPD soil, increased pH and consequently reduced the mobility of Cd and increased the mobility of As. In MGB, the amendment addition had an effect only on As mobility and bioavailability, which increased likely as a result of the increased competition for adsorption with DOC released by organic compounds.

These results indicated that the use of chisel plow or conducting no tillage with straw returned to the soil, can reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions, and improve the economic benefits of summer maize production in the region, compared with conventional moldboard plow tillage without straw (which is typically burned off). The results show that further improvements could be facilitated by improving the utilization of nitrogen fertilizer, returning straw to the soil, and reducing tillage. These practices can reduce GHG reductions, and improve EUE and farmers’ incomes."

Dictionary: {}</s>",{'Corn flour': ['Microplastics']}</s>,"As potential hazard to human health, microplastics have attracted increasing attention. Most current studies have addressed the characterization of microplastics from the environment. For microplastics in food, most detections focused on liquid systems such as alcohol, beverages, etc. , while there has been quite rare research on microplastics in solid foods with complex matrices. Thus, this study attempted to use three molecular spectral imaging approaches, namely, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), optical photothermal resonance infrared (O-PTIR), and confocal Raman spectral imaging, combined with chemometrics to characterize the presence of microplastics in corn flour. The results demonstrated that O-PTIR imaging can rapidly sense the presence of microplastics, but its data integrity and visualization were limited. By decomposing the image, FTIR and Raman acquired a more integral distribution. Wherein, microplastics were well depicted by Raman imaging coupled with independent component analysis. Moreover, O-PTIR imaging can quickly detect contaminants at low concentrations but with a low detection rate. Raman imaging underperformed in low-concentration samples but provided a better visualization in mid-concentration samples. Overall, the results confirmed that the visual detection of microplastics in powdered food can be realized by molecular spectral imaging coupled with data mining, which can provide a reference for the detection of microplastics in other foods."

Here we report designing a tachyplesin1-derived synthetic peptide AGM182 and testing its antifungal activity both in vitro and in planta. In vitro studies showed a five-fold increase in antifungal activity of AGM182 (vs. tachyplesin1) against A. flavus. Transgenic maize plants expressing AGM182 under maize Ubiquitin-1 promoter were produced through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. PCR products confirmed integration of the AGM182 gene, while RT-PCR of maize RNA confirmed the presence of AGM182 transcripts. Maize kernel screening assay using a highly aflatoxigenic A. flavus strain (AF70) showed up to 72% reduction in fungal growth in the transgenic AGM182 seeds compared to isogenic negative control seeds. Reduced fungal growth in the AGM182 transgenic seeds resulted in a significant reduction in aflatoxin levels (76-98%).

Metal daily intakes and MDIBW s of tree sparrows from Baiyin were higher than those from Liujiaxia, which can be attributed to higher metal concentrations of food sources in Baiyin than those in Liujiaxia. Metal daily intakes and MDIBW s of nestlings were higher than those of adults and juveniles. This difference is observed probably because nonphytophagous invertebrates, the predominant food fed to nestlings, possessed the highest metal concentrations. In addition, adults in summer had higher MDIs and MDIBW s than juveniles and adults in winter. This finding is probably observed because juveniles and adults in winter consumed a higher proportion of maize, which had the lowest metal concentrations.

About 28.6 kg N ha-1 was lost by leaching out of the root zone in 1998-1999 and 81.8 kg N ha-1 in 1999-2000, accounting for 5.9% and 15.7% of total nitrogen (N) inputs, respectively. The significant deep drainage and nitrate leaching loss were attributed to excessive and inappropriate irrigation and nitrogen (N) fertilization, which may result in severe groundwater pollution if current agricultural managements are not changed."

To evaluate the foliar uptake, leaf-to-root translocation of nanoplastics, as well as the influences of surface charge on the above processes and physiological effects to plants, maize (Zea mays L. ) seedlings were foliar exposed to carboxyl-modified polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-COOH) and amino-modified polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NH2), respectively. Both PS nanoplastics could effectively accumulate on the maize leaves, accompanied by observable particle aggregation. Due to electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged cell wall, positively charged PS-NH2 association with the leaf surfaces was significantly more than negatively charged PS-COOH. The fraction of PS nanoplastics entry into the leaves could efficiently transfer to the vasculature mainly through stomatal opening and move down to the roots through vascular bundle. Meanwhile, the occurrence of aggregation limited the nanoplastic translocation to the roots, especially for PS-NH2 with larger aggregate sizes relative to PS-COOH. Compared with negatively charged PS-COOH, positively charged PS-NH2 treatment had a higher inhibitory effect on photosynthesis and a stronger stimulation to the activity of antioxidant systems. Overall, our findings give a scientific basis for the risk assessment of nanoplastic exposure in air-plant systems."

","Maize-dependent populations in sub-Saharan Africa are continually exposed to aflatoxin poisoning owing to their regular consumption of this dietetic cereal. Being a staple in Kenyan households, consumption of maize-based meals is done almost daily, thereby exposing consumers to aflatoxicoses. This study assessed awareness levels, knowledge disparities, and perceptions regarding aflatoxin contamination at the post-harvest phase among farmers in the Rift Valley Region of Kenya. Households were randomly selected using a geographical positioning system (GPS) overlay of the agro-ecological zones within Uasin Gishu and Elgeyo Marakwet counties. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in 212 smallholder and large-scale farms. The study documented the demographic profiles of farmers and knowledge, awareness, and perceptions of aflatoxin contamination using a pre-designed structured questionnaire. Most farmers were familiar with aflatoxins and the adverse effects they present to health (61.32%). Almost all the farmers (94.37%) were aware of storage molds and food-spoilage fungi. However, few farmers adopted good post-harvest practices (PHPs), such as avoiding premature harvests (49.8%), using well-ventilated storage spaces (44.6%), grain sorting (30.5%), proper drying of maize (17.8%), and using hermetic bags for storage (30.5%). Conclusively, intensified farmer education is required to train farmers on good PHPs to protect their maize from aflatoxigenic fungi and aflatoxin accumulation."

The probability of exceeding the critical threshold for Cd in soil per node of a 500- x 500-m grid was approximated by Monte Carlo simulation, using the estimated cumulative distribution functions (cdf) of SOM, clay, pH, and Cd as input. The cdfs were estimated by simple indicator kriging with local prior means. For SOM, clay, and pH, detailed maps of soil type and land use were used to define subregions with assumed constant local means of the indicators (a priori distributions).

Potentially toxigenic fungi have been found in maize silage, and about 300 mycotoxins have been detected. Among these mycotoxins, the most harmful for feed and food safety are aflatoxins. The aim of the study was to set up a specific method to detect aflatoxins in maize silage, and to investigate whether aflatoxin contamination in maize silage depends on the level of field contamination of the crop, and whether the occurrence of aerobic spoilage during ensiling has any effect on the final contamination of the silage. A method for the determination of aflatoxin B(1), B(2), G(1) and G(2) in maize silage using high-performance liquid chromagraphy with fluorescence detection has been developed and validated. Recoveries of aflatoxin B(1), B(2), G(1), and G(2) spiked over the 0.25 to 5 µg kg(-1) range averaged 74-94%. The results of laboratory scale and farm scale ensiling experiments indicated that aflatoxins could increase when silage is exposed to air during conservation or during the feed-out phase. The method here proposed to detect aflatoxins in silages has proved to be sensitive and is able to detect levels of 0.1 and 0.5 ng mL(-1) for AFB(1) and AFG(1), and between 0.025 and 0.125 ng mL(-1) for AFB(2) and AFG(2).

Herein, samples of crops and soil were collected from Bijie City, a typical karst area in southwest China, to investigate the pollution level and evaluate the comprehensive F exposure risk. The single-factor index (PFw) and the geological accumulation index (Igeo) were used. The hazard index (HI) was applied to assess exposure risk from multiple exposure routes. The results revealed that there is considerable F contamination in soil and crops in the study area. Average soil total fluorine (Ft) was 1139.13 mg kg-1, and soil water soluble F (Fw) was 3.792 mg kg-1. In corn, rice, wheat, and potatoes, F contents were 1.167-9.585, 1.222-6.698, 1.587-9.976, and 1.797-9.143 mg kg-1, respectively.

We then used the AFM1 concentration data and intake rates to calculate AFM1 exposure for adults in multiple nations worldwide. Several nations including Pakistan, India, and several sub-Saharan African nations, had AFM1 levels in milk that substantially exceeded United States and European Union regulatory limits for AFM1, indicating potential risk to individuals in those nations with high milk consumption. Because no regulatory agency has set a tolerable daily intake (TDI) for AFM1, we could not compare our exposure estimates to a TDI to determine at-risk populations. But importantly, high AFM1 levels in milk indicate high levels of AFB1 in animal feed.

In this study, we used murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) as a model system to elucidate the effect of FB1 on the function of BMDCs through biological methods. We found that FB1 reversed the morphological changes and enhanced the endocytosis of FITC-dextran in LPS-treated BMDCs. At the same time, FB1 decreased the LPS-induced expressions of MHC II, C[1]D80 and CD86 molecules in BMDCs (p<0.05), as well as the T-cell stimulatory capacity of BMDCs (p<0.01). Moreover, the secretions of IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12, but not TNF-α induced by LPS exposure were suppressed by FB1 in a dose dependent (p<0.01). It was considered that the immunosuppressive effects of FB1 were mainly caused by changing the morphology and interfering with the process of antigen uptake, processing and presentation. The results highlighted that FB1 had the capacity to modulate the immune responses of BMDCs."

In this work, we describe a homologous and high-throughput multi-wavelength fluorescence polarization immunoassay (MWFPIA) for the multiplexed detection of mycotoxins. Three typical Fusarium mycotoxins, deoxynivalenol (DON), T-2 toxin and fumonisin B1 (FB1), were labeled with different dyes. Tracers and specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were employed in the MWFPIA to simultaneously detect the three mycotoxins. Under optimal conditions, the limits of detection using MWFPIA were 242.0 μg kg(-1) for DON, 17.8 μg kg(-1) for T-2 toxin and 331.5 μg kg(-1) for FB1, providing sufficient sensitivity to meet the action levels of these three contaminants in maize as set by the European Union. The use of a methanol/water (2:3, v/v) mixture for sample pretreatment allowed recoveries ranging from 76.5-106.3%, with coefficients of variation less than 21.7%. The total time of analysis, including sample preparation, was less than 30 min. Twenty naturally contaminated maize samples were tested using MWFPIA and HPLC-MS/MS, with correlation coefficients (R(2)) of 0.97 for DON and 0.99 for FB1. By changing the targets of interest, homologous MWFPIA, a method with high sensitivity, a simple procedure and a short analysis time, can easily be extended to other chemical contaminants.

Their anti-GM project entailed educating local farmers about genetics, importing genetic testing kits, seed-banking landrace corn and sending seeds to 'solidarity growers' around the world. This article explores material-semiotic translations to explain one of the central aspects of this project, the definition and circulation of Zapatista corn--an entity defined not only through cultural geography, but also technological means. Through its circulation, Zapatista corn serves to perform a biocultural engagement with Zapatista's political project of resistance to neoliberalism. While much has been written about both regulatory policy and consumer activism against GM in the Global North, Zapatista corn also provides a case study in indigenous, anti-GM activism founded on biocultural innovation and the creation of alternative networks for circulating corn."

Drought stress is a major factor to contribute to preharvest aflatoxin contamination. Recent studies have demonstrated higher concentration of defense or stress-related proteins in corn kernels of resistant genotypes compared with susceptible genotypes, suggesting that preharvest field condition (drought or not drought) influences gene expression differently in different genotypes resulting in different levels of ""end products"": PR(pathogenesis-related) proteins in the mature kernels. Because of the complexity of Aspergillus-plant interactions, better understanding of the mechanisms of genetic resistance will be needed using genomics and proteomics for crop improvement.

Proteomic comparisons of corn kernel proteins between resistant or susceptible genotypes to Aspergillus flavus infection have identified stress-related proteins along with antifungal proteins as associated with kernel resistance.

This system employs evanescent-wave fluorescence excitation to probe binding events as they occur on the surface of a waveguide. Methanolic extracts of the samples were diluted threefold with buffer containing a mixture of fluorescent antibodies and were then passed over the arrays of mycotoxins immobilized on a waveguide. Fluorescent signals of the surface-bound antibody-antigen complexes decreased with increasing concentrations of free mycotoxins in the extract. After sample analysis was completed, surfaces were regenerated with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride in 50 mM glycine, pH 2.0. The limits of detection determined by the manual biosensor system were as follows: 1, 180, and 65 ng/g for DON and 1, 60, and 85 ng/g for OTA in cornmeal, wheat, and barley, respectively. The limits of detection in cornmeal determined with the automated array biosensor were 15 and 150 ng/g for OTA and DON, respectively."

Aflatoxins remain a scourge in the country, unprecedentedly reducing the nutritional and economic value of agricultural foods. This review was sought to synthetize the country's major findings in relation to the mycotoxins' etiology, epidemiology, detection, quantification, exposure assessment, control, and reduction in different matrices. Electronic results indicate that aflatoxins in Uganda are produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus and have been reported in maize, sorghum, sesame, beans, sunflower, millet, peanuts, and cassava. The causes and proliferation of aflatoxigenic contamination of Ugandan foods have been largely due to poor pre-, peri-, and postharvest activities, poor government legislation, lack of awareness, and low levels of education among farmers, entrepreneurs, and consumers on this plague. Little diet diversity has exacerbated the risk of exposure to aflatoxins in Uganda because most of the staple foods are aflatoxin-prone. On the detection and control, these are still marginal, though some devoted scholars have devised and validated a sensitive portable device for on-site aflatoxin detection in maize and shown that starter cultures used for making some cereal-based beverages have the potential to bind aflatoxins. More efforts should be geared towards awareness creation and vaccination against hepatitis B and hepatitis A to reduce the risk of development of liver cancer among the populace."

However, there are sporadic reports of fumonisin contamination in wheat worldwide. The rice adherent fungus Gibberella fujikuroi is taxonomically closely related to F. verticillioides. Therefore, the potential risk of fumonisin contamination in rice and wheat is significant. Previously, a sensitive detection method utilizing liquid chromatography with tandem electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS-MS) was developed for the determination of fumonisins in brown rice. In the present study, the incidence of fumonisins in brown rice and wheat harvested in Japan was investigated using LC-ESI-MS-MS. Forty-eight rice samples and 47 wheat samples were screened and analyzed for the major B-type fumonisins: fumonisin B1 (FB1) and fumonisin B2 (FB2). About 1 kg of rice or wheat seed was divided into three subsamples, and 10 g from each subsample was used for the analysis. The limits of detection were 0.012 and 0.011 mg/kg for FBt and FB2, respectively, in rice samples and 0.010 and 0.008 mg/kg for FB1 and FB2, respectively, in wheat samples. The mean (standard deviation) recoveries of FB1 spiked at 0.50 mg/kg into toxin-free rice and wheat samples were 77.6 (4.2)% and 84.5 (3.1)%, respectively. One of the wheat samples was positive for FBt with a value greater than the limit of detection,but no fumonisin was found in any of the rice samples.

The presence of Cd in agricultural soils is of great concern regarding its transfer in the soil-plant system. This study investigated the transfer of Cd (exogenous salts) from a wide range of Chinese soils to corn grain (Zhengdan 958). Through multiple stepwise regressions, prediction models were developed, with the combination of Cd bioconcentration factor (BCF) of Zhengdan 958 and soil pH, organic matter (OM) content, and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Moreover, these prediction models from Zhengdan 958 were applied to other non-model corn species through cross-species extrapolation approach. The results showed that the pH of the soil was the most important factor that controlled Cd uptake and lower pH was more favorable for Cd bioaccumulation in corn grain. There was no significant difference among three prediction models in the different Cd levels. When the prediction models were applied to other non-model corn species, the ratio ranges between the predicted BCF values and the measured BCF values were within an interval of 2 folds and close to the solid line of 1∶1 relationship. Furthermore, these prediction models also reduced the measured BCF intra-species variability for all non-model corn species. Therefore, the prediction models established in this study can be applied to other non-model corn species and be useful for predicting the Cd bioconcentration in corn grain and assessing the ecological risk of Cd in different soils."

We also investigated swim season water quality trends through the course of this work. From 2007 to 2009, 52, 80, and 81%, of nests at the two primary nest colonies had their eggs rendered inviable by corn oil application. Counts of HY and after hatch-year (AHY) gulls were analyzed during treatment years for 10 beaches. Water quality data were available from the Chicago Park District during our three treatment years and the prior year (baseline) for 19 beaches. HY counts declined at all 10 surveyed beaches from the initial year (52% nests with oiled eggs) to subsequent years with ~80% of nests oiled. Overall, HY gulls numbers on beaches decreased 86% from 2007 to 2009. Decreases in beach usage by AHY gulls were not detected. Compared to pretreatment, the number of beaches with improved water quality test rates increased each year through the course of the study. The frequency of water quality tests showing bacterial exceedances compared to 2006 declined at 18 of 19 beaches by 2009.

When grown in contaminated soil, accessions varied significantly in leaf Cd concentration at both the seeding and maturing stages with phenotypic variation and the coefficient of variation all above 48%. The co-localized region between SYN27837 (147,034,650 bp) and SYN36598 (168,551,327 bp) on chromosome 2 was associated with leaf Cd under three soil conditions varying in Cd content in 2015 and 2016.

The target hazard quotient (THQ) of heavy metals in edible grains of crops was selected to assess their risk to human health. Total THQ values were higher than 1.0 for the wheat samples from sewage-irrigated area and both sewage-irrigated and smelter-impacted areas, and As is the main contributor to the total THQ and posed the potential risk to human health. Therefore, the accumulation of Cd, Pb, Hg, and As in soils and crops in sewage-irrigated area should be monitored continuously to ensure food safety and security."

We investigated the developmental-stage-dependent relationship between maize kernels and fumonisin B1 production by using kernels collected at the blister (R2), milk (R3), dough (R4), and dent (R5) stages following inoculation in culture at their respective field moisture contents with F. moniliforme.

Subsequently, the influence of SG on the uptake, translocation, and metabolism of PCB28 in maize seedlings was investigated through hydroponic exposure experiment. Adsorption isotherm of PCB28 to SG fitted best with the Langmuir model and the Polanyi-Dubinin-Manes (PDM) model, with the maximum adsorption capacity (Qmax) calculated as around 530 mg kg-1. The presence of SG significantly promoted the maximum accumulation amount of PCB28 in roots by 112%, whereas reduced that in stems and leaves by 32 and 39%, respectively. The translocation factor (TFs) of PCB28 from roots to stems was 26-70% lower for SG exposed seedlings than nonexposed seedlings when the exposure time was longer than 24 h, demonstrating an obvious suppression of SG in the transportation of PCB28 from roots to stems.

In plants, phenolamides are involved in biotic stress response. The data on variations of phenolamides in AFB1-containing seeds are limited. RESULTS:Five polyamine conjugates, including two spermidine and three putrescine conjugates, were tentatively identified in methanolic extracts, using HPLC-DAD-MS. The ratio of putrescine to spermidine conjugates changed with increasing AFB1 concentration in a logistic dose-response manner, with a ratio of below 1 up to a concentration of 51.51 μg kg-1 , and approximately 2.54 and 3 at higher concentrations of 177.4 and 308.13 μg kg-1 , respectively. The observed variations of the total antioxidant activity and the total phenolic content may support this biphasic behaviour of the seeds against AFB1 stress. CONCLUSIONS:The obtained data are a contribution to the understanding of the roles of polyamine conjugates in seed defence to increasing AFB1 concentrations. According to our knowledge, this study reports for the first time the biphasic response of maize seeds to increasing AFB1 contamination level, comprising the induction of polyamine conjugate accumulation and variation in the ratio of conjugates. This dose-response relationship may provide useful information in the field of agricultural and food chemistry as an indicator of AFB1 contamination level and, hence, for selecting an appropriate seed quality."

The underlying differences between the diets with the high protein levels are likely to sensitize the kidneys to FB(1)-induced toxic and carcinogenic effects. Several other dietary factors, such as plant extracts (antioxidants) and dietary Fe, could either stimulate or inhibit cancer induction of FB(1), which complicates the comparison of toxicological effects in experimental animals.

Proper drying can reduce the post‐harvest losses. The study was conducted to determine suitable surfaces for chili drying and the relationship between physical appearance of pods and AFs content to aid management decisions during drying and storage. Chilies dried on ten different surfaces were found to result in varied levels of AFs of between 3.14 and 6.46 ng/g. Chili pods dried on green net (either on or above the ground) for sun drying gave best control of AFs production with lower levels compared to other surfaces. Meanwhile, the AF level in damaged pods (10.11 ± 3.54 ng/g) is three times higher than the AF level, i. e. , 3.02 ± 1.17 ng/g in intact pods. The research study concludes that proper drying surface and sorting of pods can minimize the rejections by quality monitoring and trade authorities. NOVELTY IMPACT STATEMENT: The outcome of the present study will help develop better practices and guidelines for the drying of chilies utilizing existing sun drying facilities for the control of aflatoxin contamination.

Use of animal protein in fish feeds is expensive; hence, a majority of farmers from developing countries use local feed ingredients from plant origin as a source of dietary protein. However, these ingredients of plant origin provide the best natural substrates for fungi, which can be easily accompanied by mycotoxin development under suitable conditions.

Analysis of Cr content, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzymes (catalase and superoxide dismutase isozymes), peroxisomal H2O2-producing glycolate oxidase and the main NADPH-regenerating system revealed that chromium causes oxidative stress, leading to a general increase in these activities in coleptiles and roots, with the latter organ being the most affected. However, cotyledons behaved in an opposite manner.

Dictionary: {}</s>",{'poultry': ['Aflatoxins']}</s>,"Aflatoxins are mainly produced by certain strains of Aspergillus flavus, which are found in diverse agricultural crops. In many lower-income countries, aflatoxins pose serious public health issues since the occurrence of these toxins can be considerably common and even extreme. Aflatoxins can negatively affect health of livestock and poultry due to contaminated feeds. Additionally, they significantly limit the development of international trade as a result of strict regulation in high-value markets. Due to their high stability, aflatoxins are not only a problem during cropping, but also during storage, transport, processing, and handling steps. Consequently, innovative evidence-based technologies are urgently required to minimize aflatoxin exposure. Thus far, biological control has been developed as the most innovative potential technology of controlling aflatoxin contamination in crops, which uses competitive exclusion of toxigenic strains by non-toxigenic ones. This technology is commercially applied in groundnuts maize, cottonseed, and pistachios during pre-harvest stages. Some other effective technologies such as irradiation, ozone fumigation, chemical and biological control agents, and improved packaging materials can also minimize post-harvest aflatoxins contamination in agricultural products. However, integrated adoption of these pre- and post-harvest technologies is still required for sustainable solutions to reduce aflatoxins contamination, which enhances food security, alleviates malnutrition, and strengthens economic sustainability."

These increases might trigger the requirement for additional energy consumption for water treatment to remove the nitrates. While these increasing concentrations of nitrate might pose a human health concern, most water resources were found to be within current maximum contaminant level (MCL) limits of 10 mg L(-1) NO(3)-N. When water resources exceed this MCL, energy-intensive drinking water treatment is required to reduce nitrate levels below 10 mg L(-1). Based on prior estimates of water supplies currently exceeding the nitrate MCL, we calculate that advanced drinking water treatment might require an additional 2360 million kWh annually (for nitrate affected areas only)--a 2100% increase in energy requirements for water treatment in those same areas--to mitigate nitrate contamination and meet the MCL requirement. We predict that projected increases in nitrate contamination in water may impact the energy consumed in the water treatment sector, because of the convergence of several related trends: (1) increasing cornstarch-based ethanol production, (2) increasing nutrient loading in surface water and groundwater resources as a consequence of increased corn-based ethanol production, (3) additional drinking water sources that exceed the MCL for nitrate, and (4) potentially more stringent drinking water standards for nitrate."

Dictionary: {maize: ['fumonisins', 'fusarins']}</s>",{'maize': ['fumonisins']}</s>,"Contamination of maize ( Zea mays ) with fumonisins produced by the fungus Fusarium verticillioides is a global concern for food safety. Fumonisins are a group of polyketide-derived secondary metabolites linked to esophageal cancer and neural tube birth defects in humans and numerous toxicoses in livestock. Despite the importance of fumonisins in global maize production, the regulation of fumonisin biosynthesis during kernel pathogenesis is poorly understood. The HAP complex is a conserved, heterotrimeric transcriptional regulator that binds the consensus sequence CCAAT to modulate gene expression. Recently, functional characterization of the Hap3 subunit linked the HAP complex to the regulation of secondary metabolism and stalk rot pathogenesis in F. verticillioides. Here, we determine the involvement of HAP3 in fumonisin biosynthesis and kernel pathogenesis. Deletion of HAP3 suppressed fumonisin biosynthesis on both nonviable and live maize kernels and impaired pathogenesis in living kernels. Transcriptional profiling via RNA sequencing indicated that the HAP complex regulates at least 1,223 genes in F. verticillioides , representing nearly 10% of all predicted genes. Disruption of the HAP complex caused the misregulation of biosynthetic gene clusters underlying the production of secondary metabolites, including fusarins. Taken together, these results reveal that the HAP complex is a central regulator of fumonisin biosynthesis and kernel pathogenesis and works as both a positive and negative regulator of secondary metabolism in F. verticillioides."

In this study, we aimed to assess the contamination of soil and maize (Zea mays L. ) near a coal gangue-fired power plant (CGPP) in Liupanshui City, Guizhou Province, China, by TEs. The contents of 11 TEs (Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, V, and Zn) in soil samples and different maize tissues were measured, and their chemical speciation in soil was also determined. The results showed that the soil in the study area was polluted by the above elements to varying degrees at a very high potential ecological risk. The Cr and Pb levels in niblets of partial samples exceeded the Chinese food safety standards. The TE contents of maize tissues largely depend on the bioavailable fraction of the same elements in the soils, rather than their total contents. Pearson's correlation and hierarchical cluster analyses resulted in three clusters:(1) Pb-Zn-Cd; (2) Co-Cu-Mn-Sb-V-Be; and (3) Cr-Ni.

These studies formed the basis for the International Agency for Research on Cancer to classify the aflatoxins as Group 1 known human carcinogens. In addition, aflatoxin contamination levels have been used in international commodity trade to set the price of various staples such as maize and groundnuts. While there have been many case-control and prospective cohort studies of liver cancer risk over the years there have been remarkably few investigations focused on liver cancer in Latin America. Our interdisciplinary and multiple institutional collaborative has been developing a long-term strategy to characterize the role of aflatoxin and other mycotoxins as health risk factors in Guatemala and neighboring countries.

Aflatoxins were detected in all food types (cowpea, maize, peanut and sorghum) except in millet. Aflatoxin B1 was the most prevalent mycotoxin in peanut (64%) and rice (57%), while fumonisin B1 occurred most in maize (93%) and beauvericin in sorghum (71%). The total aflatoxin concentration was highest in peanut (max: 8422 µg/kg; mean: 1281 µg/kg) and rice (max: 955 µg/kg; mean: 94 µg/kg), whereas the totals of the B-type fumonisins and citrinin were highest in maize (max: 68,204 µg/kg; mean: 2988 µg/kg) and sorghum (max: 1335 µg/kg; mean: 186 µg/kg), respectively. Citrinin levels also reached 51,195 µg/kg (mean: 2343 µg/kg) in maize. Aflatoxin and citrinin concentrations in maize were significantly (p < 0.05) higher during storage than at harvest. The estimated chronic exposures to aflatoxins, citrinin and fumonisins were high, resulting in as much as 247 new liver cancer cases/year/100,000 population and risks of nephrotoxicity and esophageal cancer, respectively. Children who consumed the foods were the most vulnerable. Mycotoxin co-occurrence was evident, which could increase the health risk of the outcomes.

To elucidate the mechanisms that cause differences in plant decomposition, structural plant components (i. e. , C:N ratio, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose) were examined. Furthermore, Cry1Ab and Cry3Bb1 protein concentrations in maize leaf residues were measured from harvest to the next growing season. While leaf residue decomposition in transgenic and non-transgenic plants was similar, differences among conventional cultivars were evident. Similarly, plant components among conventional hybrids differed more than between transgenic and non-transgenic hybrids. Moreover, differences in senescent plant material collected directly from plants were larger than after exposure to soil for 5 months. While the concentration of Cry3Bb1 was higher in senescent maize leaves than that of Cry1Ab, degradation was faster, indicating that Cry3Bb1 has a shorter persistence in plant residues.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of BaP on the endometrial receptivity and implantation in mice. In this experimental study, 40 pregnant BALB/c mice were divided into 5 groups (n = 8/each) as follows: experimental groups received the doses of 100 µg/kg, 200 µg/kg, and 500 µg/kg BaP dissolved in corn oil, the control group received normal saline and sham group received corn oil. Pregnant mice administered these solutions from Day 1 to Day 5 of gestation by gavage. On Day 6, the mice were sacrificed. Then their embryos were counted and the hormonal, histomorphological and molecular analyses were performed on the mocusa of uterine tube. The data revealed that BaP reduces estrogen and progesterone levels, decreases the number of implantation site, endometrium thickness, uterine lumen diameter, stromal cells and endometrial glands, and blood vessels in the endometrium. However, the expression of Activin receptor-like kinase 5 and E-cadherin genes was not changed by BaP with different doses.

The results showed that the root length and biomass of maize seedlings of the groups treated with the six chelating ligands (EDTA, iodide, ammonium, thiosulfate, thiocyanate, and thiocarbamide) did not change compared with those of the non-treated groups. Co-exposure to Hg and each chelating ligand markedly alleviated the inhibitory effect induced by Hg. Iodide treatment resulted in the lowest root Hg content and highest translocation factor (TF) value, while ammonium treatment gave rise to the highest shoot Hg concentration and lowest TF. Compared with other chelating ligands, thiosulfate exhibited the maximum alleviation of Hg toxicity and achieved the highest concentration of Hg in the roots and aerial parts. Moreover, the TF and Hg accumulation in the thiosulfate and Hg co-exposed group were much higher than those in the group exposed to Hg alone.

Production processes involving multiple heat treatments are exemplified with the cornflakes production. For that, potential compliance with FB maximum levels was assessed. Moreover, effects of fermentation of maize matrices and production of maize germ oil are covered by this review."

Therefore, the aims of this investigation were to study the impact of inorganic (i. e. nano hydroxyapatite, NHA and polyacrylamide, PAM) and organic (i. e. sugar beet factory lime, SBFL and biochar, BI) soil amendments on maize productivity grown in contaminated silty clay (i. e. fluvial, lacustrine) and sandy (i. e. marine) alkaline soils. In addition, the effect of those amendments on the content of heavy metals in plant organs and their fractions in alkaline soils at harvest as well as human health risk assessment were investigated. Application of amendments, particularly SBFL, followed by NHA and BI resulted in an improvement for maize growth and its productivity in comparison to PAM application and untreated soil. However, application of NHA significantly reduced the mobile fraction of Cd, Pb and Ni in soil and consequently in different maize organs, followed by application of SBFL and BI in comparison to untreated soil or soil treated with PAM. Additionally, transfer factors and health risk of metals were lesser when NHA and SBFL were applied into soil than those obtained from application of PAM. In conclusion, applications of NHA, SBFL and BI into contaminated alkaline soils with toxic heavy metals can be considered a vital option for ameliorating such soils from the view of environment and sustainable management in terms of heavy metals immobilization and reducing the metals content in plant organs."

This paper expounds a method of preparing a novel environment-friendly seed coating agent for maize and researches its mechanism of action. The natural polysaccharide polymer, which is the main active ingredient of this environment-friendly seed coating agent, has the characteristics of innocuity and harmlessness, and it can replace the toxic ingredients used in traditional seed coating agents. This environment-friendly seed coating agent for maize was mainly made up of the natural polysaccharide polymer and other additives. The field trials results showed that the control efficacy of Helminthosporium maydis came to 93.72%, the anti-feeding rate of cutworms came to 81.29%, and the maize yield was increased by 17.75%. Besides, the LD50 value (half the lethal dose in rats) of this seed coating agent was 10 times higher than that of the traditional seed coating agents. This seed coating agent could improve the activity of plant protective enzymes (peroxidase, catalase and superoxidase dismutase) and increase the chlorophyll content. This seed coating agent has four characteristics of disease prevention, desinsectization, increasing yield and safety. Results of mechanism analyses showed that this seed coating agent could enhance disease control effectiveness by improving plant protective enzymes activity and increase maize yield by improving chlorophyll content."

Plants producing Cry proteins from the bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), have become a major tactic for controlling pest Lepidoptera on cotton and maize and risk assessment studies are needed to ensure they do not harm important natural enemies. However, using Cry protein susceptible hosts as prey often compromises such studies. To avoid this problem we utilized pest Lepidoptera, cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), that were resistant to Cry1Ac produced in Bt broccoli (T. ni), Cry1Ac/Cry2Ab produced in Bt cotton (T. ni), and Cry1F produced in Bt maize (S. frugiperda). Larvae of these species were fed Bt plants or non-Bt plants and then exposed to predaceous larvae of the green lacewing Chrysoperla rufilabris. Fitness parameters (larval survival, development time, fecundity and egg hatch) of C. rufilabris were assessed over two generations. There were no differences in any of the fitness parameters regardless if C. rufilabris consumed prey (T. ni or S. frugiperda) that had consumed Bt or non-Bt plants. Additional studies confirmed that the prey contained bioactive Cry proteins when they were consumed by the predator. These studies confirm that Cry1Ac, Cry2Ab and Cry1F do not pose a hazard to the important predator C. rufilabris. This study also demonstrates the power of using resistant hosts when assessing the risk of genetically modified plants on non-target organisms."

The corn varieties MMRI, Sadaf, and Pearl behaved differently when treated with water from various sources. Water taken from sewage had a higher concentration of potassium compared to canal and groundwater that is why the maize plants irrigated with this water had a higher grouping. Data regarding potassium concentration in different body parts of chicken showed that season and treatment have a significant effect on the potassium concentration in chicken organs. The variety was non-significant for the potassium concentration only in the bone. Season × Variety interaction was only significant in blood, meat heart, and gizzard. Season × Treatment and Variety × Treatment interactions were significant in the heart, kidney, and gizzard. The potassium contents were higher in the chicken body parts that were reared on grains irrigated with sewage water as compared to other groups. The potassium contents were higher in the chicken meat (96.23 ± 0.00) reared on grains of the Pearl variety raised with the sewage water.

Moreover, these prediction models from Zhengdan 958 were applied to other non-model corn species through cross-species extrapolation approach. The results showed that the soil pH and OM were the major factors that controlled Pb transfer from soil to corn grain. The lower pH and OM could improve the bioaccumulation of Pb in corn grain. No significant differences were found between two prediction models derived from the different exogenous Pb contents. When the prediction models were applied to other non-model corn species, the ratio ranges between the predicted BCF values and the measured BCF values were within an interval of 2-fold and close to the solid line of 1∶1 relationship. Moreover, the prediction model i. e. Log[BCF] = -0.098 pH-0.150 log[OM] -1.894 at the treatment of high Pb can effectively reduce the measured BCF intra-species variability for all non-model corn species.

FBs could cause a variety of diseases in animals and humans, such as hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic, hepatocarcinogenic and cytotoxic effects in mammals. To date, almost no review has addressed the toxicity of FBs in relation to oxidative stress and their metabolism. The focus of this article is primarily intended to summarize the progress in research associated with oxidative stress as a plausible mechanism for FB-induced toxicity as well as the metabolism. The present review showed that studies have been carried out over the last three decades to elucidate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress as a result of FBs treatment and have correlated them with various types of FBs toxicity, indicating that oxidative stress plays critical roles in the toxicity of FBs. The major metabolic pathways of FBs are hydrolysis, acylation and transamination. Ceramide synthase, carboxylesterase FumD and aminotransferase FumI could degrade FB1 and FB2. The cecal microbiota of pigs and alkaline processing such as nixtamalization can also transform FB1 into metabolites. Most of the metabolites of FB1 were less toxic than FB1, except its partial (pHFB1) metabolites. Further understanding of the role of oxidative stress in FB-induced toxicity will throw new light on the use of antioxidants, scavengers of ROS, as well as on the blind spots of metabolism and the metabolizing enzymes of FBs. The present review might contribute to reveal the toxicity of FBs and help to protect against their oxidative damage."

Abundance and diversity of aflatoxin producing Aspergillus flavus account for accumulation of the toxins in crops, which has been a persistent threat for public health and economy in tropical developing countries. A study was conducted to investigate occurrence and level of A. flavus and relate them to aflatoxin level in maize in Kenya and Tanzania. A total of 786 maize samples were collected at harvesting in selected areas of the two countries for the analysis. Fungal abundance in the samples was expressed as amount of fungal DNA relative to maize DNA. The fungal DNA was quantified by qPCR, targeting internal transcribed space (ITS) gene whereas in maize DNA was quantified through alpha-tubulin gene. The two genes are known to be conserved. Aflatoxins were quantified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography, coupled to ultra-high sensitivity, ultra-fast triple quadrupole, tandem-mass spectrophotometer. A flavus was detected in 88.5% of 786 tested samples and average fungal load for the samples (log host/pathogen ratio) was 5.53. Aflatoxin occurrence was positive in 31.9% of the samples at an average level of 2.3 ± 0.643 ppb. There was a positive relationship between occurrence and level if the aflatoxin B 1 and presence and biomass of A. flavus was proved statistically. The findings of this study intensify the need to give substantial attention on preharvest control of A. flavus in cereal fields as an effort of controlling accumulation of aflatoxin B 1 in foods."

The resultant QBs, with approximately 2800 times brighter luminescence than the corresponding QDs, were explored as novel fluorescent probes in the immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for sensitive and quantitative detection of zearalenone (ZEN) in corns. Various parameters that influenced the sensitivity and stability of QB-based ICA (QB-ICA) were investigated and optimized. The optimal QB-ICA exhibits good dynamic linear detection for ZEN over the range of 0.125 ng/mL to 10 ng/mL with a median inhibitory concentration of 1.01±0.09 ng/mL (n=3). The detection limits for ZEN in a standard solution and real corn sample (dilution ratio of 1:30) are 0.0625 ng/mL and 3.6 µg/kg, respectively, which is much better than that of a previously reported gold nanoparticle-based ICA method. Forty-six natural corn samples are assayed using both QB-ICA and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The two methods show a highly significant correlation (R(2)=0.92). Nine ZEN-contaminated samples were further confirmed with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the QB-ICA results also exhibited good agreement with LC-MS/MS method. In brief, this work demonstrates that QB-ICA is capable of rapid, sensitive screening of toxins in food analysis, and shows great promise for point-of-care testing of other analytes."

At harvest, fungi were isolated from kernels and aflatoxin and fumonisin were quantified using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. Stemborer and FAW damage was significantly (p =.001) reduced by over 50% under the push–pull system. There was also a significant (p <.001) reduction in the incidence of Fusarium verticillioides (60%) and Aspergillus flavus (86%), which was reflected in a reduced incidence of ear rots (50%) with the push–pull system (p =.001).

This review compiles relevant information about mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium in raw material of artisanal beer, as well as updates information about the production and fate of mycotoxins during the beer brewing process. Findings highlight that malting conditions favor the production of mycotoxins by the fungi contaminating cereals. Therefore, good agricultural and postharvest mitigation strategies are the most effective options for preventing the growth of toxigenic fungi and the production of mycotoxins in cereals. However, the final concentration of mycotoxin in artisanal beer is difficult to predict as it depends on the initial concentration contained in the raw material and the processing conditions. The current lack of limits of mycotoxins in artisanal beer underestimates possible risks to human health. In addition, modified mycotoxins, not detected by conventional methods, may be formed in artisanal beers. Maximum tolerated limits for these contaminants must be urgently established based on scientific data about transfer of mycotoxins throughout the artisanal beer brewery process."

However, owing to recently introduced ""Horizontal Natural Product Transfer"" concept, concerns have been raised over how these common agricultural practices could potentially lead to toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), from decaying or burnt C. odorata residues, taken up by food crops and subsequently accumulate in the food chain. A field experiment was therefore conducted to analyze the PA contents in the tissues of maize (Zea mays L. ) plants grown on slash-and-burn and slash-and-mulch plots, previously dominated with Chromolaena odorata, using liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC-ESI-MS/MS). The results revealed, in general, trace amounts of PAs in the maize tissues (i. e. roots, leaves and grains) at maturity while significantly higher levels were detected in the surface soils sampled before sowing (for both plots), 45 days after sowing (slash-and-burn plot) and 90 days after sowing (slash-and-mulch plot). These findings demonstrate, for the first time, the leaching out of PAs from C. odorata residues (e. g. mulch and ash particles) and taken up by maize tissues. In spite of its air polluting and farmland degrading effects, slash-and-burn agricultural practices could lead, in the long term, to relatively lower accumulation of PAs in maize cultivated on PA-plant dominated fallow farmlands, hence smallholder farmers are encouraged to frequently employ this farming system."

Popcorn with the Ga1‐s allele accepts pollen only from Ga1‐s corn, allowing for field corn and popcorn to be nearby without isolation. Germplasm is being introduced to the United States to increase field corn diversity that unknowingly contains the Ga1‐m allele, which can overcome Ga1‐s selectivity and pollinate popcorn. The risk to the popcorn industry has been underassessed. Experiments were conducted to model the frequency of PMGF from Ga1‐m field corn to Ga1‐s popcorn under field conditions and to evaluate the role of wind speed and direction using a concentric donor–receptor design in 2017 and 2018 in Nebraska, USA. The PMGF to white popcorn was detected using a field corn pollen donor with yellow kernel color (dominate) and further confirmed with a molecular test. Popcorn kernels were harvested from cardinal and ordinal directions from 1 to 70 m. More than 7 million kernels were screened to detect the PMGF. Information‐theoretic criteria were used to select the best‐fit model. The greatest PMGF (1.6– 4.1%) was detected at 1 m and declined with distance. The PMGF was detected at 70 m, the maximum distance tested. Amplification of Ga1 followed by restriction enzyme digest confirmed that yellow kernelled progeny were hybrids from the result of PMGF. This is the first assessment of PMGF from field corn to popcorn, and the results are alarming for the popcorn industry and export market."

Molecular epidemiologic and genomic deep sequencing studies have affirmed that infection with hepatitis B virus as well as dietary exposure to aflatoxins through contamination of dietary staples such as corn, and to microcystins - blue-green algal toxins found in ditch and pond water - were likely important etiologic factors that account for the high incidence of liver cancer in this region. Public health initiatives to facilitate universal vaccination of newborns against HBV and to improve drinking water sources in this rural area, as well as economic and social mandates serendipitously facilitating dietary diversity, have led to precipitous declines in exposures to these etiologic factors, concomitantly driving substantive declines in the liver cancer incidence seen now in Qidong.

Studies have identified trichothecene production as a virulence factor in Fusarium graminearum and have linked DON resistance to the ability to form DON-3-O-glucoside in wheat. Here, the structures of a deoxynivalenol:UDP-glucosyltransferase (Os79) from Oryza sativa are reported in complex with UDP in an open conformation, in complex with UDP in a closed conformation, and in complex with UDP-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose and trichothecene at 1.8, 2.3, and 2.2 Å resolution, respectively. The active site of Os79 lies in a groove between the N-terminal acceptor and the C-terminal donor-binding domains. Structural alignments reveal that Os79 likely utilizes a catalytic mechanism similar to those of other plant UGTs, with His 27 activating the trichothecene O3 hydroxyl for nucleophilic attack at C1' of the UDP-glucose donor. Kinetic analysis of mutant Os79 revealed that Thr 291 plays a critical role in catalysis as a catalytic acid or to position the UDP moiety during the nucleophilic attack. Steady-state kinetic analysis demonstrated that Os79 conjugates multiple trichothecene substrates such as DON, nivalenol, isotrichodermol, and HT-2 toxin, but not T-2 toxin. These data establish a foundation for understanding substrate specificity and activity in this enzyme and can be used to guide future efforts to increase DON resistance in cereal crops."

Soil enzyme activities and low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs), as well as antioxidant and degradation enzyme activities in plant tissues were measured. The maximum accumulation of ametryn was found in shoots and roots of wheat and alfalfa. Ryegrass had the maximum ametryn translocation factor (TF) from roots to shoots, with more than three times over the other crops. The ametryn residue in ryegrass-planted soil was much lower than that in soil planted with others. The residual content of ametryn in crop-planted soils was ordered as rhizosphere soil<bulk soil<non-rhizosphere soil<control (without plants). Activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and laccase (LAC) in ametryn-exposed ryegrass were significant higher than those in non-ametryn exposed ryegrass. The maximum activities of CAT in ryegrass shoot and root were increased by 6.16- and 28.84-fold over the control, respectively.

The stimulation of PAH desorption from BB by low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) was gentle and did not significantly retard the adsorption of PAHs on BB700, indicating that BB700 reduced PAH bioavailability primarily via immobilization. The total and bioavailable concentrations of PAHs were both lower in the 2% CB300-treated soils than the control. LMWOAs facilitated PAH release from CB300-amended soils, thus increasing the bioavailability of immobilized PAHs. The relative abundances of the bacteria, functional genes, and methanogens involved in PAH anaerobic degradation were significantly higher in the 2% CB300 treatment than other treatments. Fast PAH dissipation in soil amended with 2% CB300 may be attributed to the increased bioavailability of immobilized PAHs and enhanced biodegradation, both of which were induced by LMWOAs and CB.

Three wireworm species, Agriotes brevis Candeze, A. sordidus Illiger and A. ustulatus Schäller, were identified as the dominant pest species in maize fields. Over the 29-year period surveyed, no yield reduction was observed when wireworm plant damage was below 15 % of the stand. A preliminary univariate analysis of risk assessment was applied to identify the main factors influencing the occurrence of damage. A multifactorial model was then applied by using the significant factors identified. This model allowed the research to highlight the strongest factors and to analyse how the main factors together influenced damage risk. The strongest factors were: A. brevis as prevalent damaging species, soil organic matter content >5 %, rotation including meadows and/or double crops, A. sordidus as prevalent damaging species, and surrounding landscape mainly meadows, uncultivated grass and double crops. The multifactorial model also showed how the simultaneous occurrence of two or more of the aforementioned risk factors can conspicuously increase the risk of wireworm damage to maize crops, while the probability of damage to a field with no-risk factors is always low (<1 %). These results make it possible to draw risk maps to identify low-risk and high-risk areas, a first step in implementing bespoke IPM procedures in an attempt to reduce the impact of soil insecticides significantly."

Excessive hormones in the soil from the pollutant discharge of intensive farming would pose a potential threat to the ecology and the human health. Vanadium oxide modified carbon nanotube (VOX-CNT) was synthesized and applied as persulfate (PDS) activator to reduce17β-estrogen (17β-E2) in soil. 86.06 % 17β-E2 could be degraded within 12 h. Process of materials exchange during oxidation was interfered by soil, resulting in insufficient degradation of 17β-E2, but the active species involved in 17β-E2 degradation would also be enriched by it. 17β-E2 was adsorbed on the VOX-CNT surface and directly degraded mainly by the active species generated on the catalyst surface, and •OH dominated the degradation of 17β-E2 in VOX-CNT/PDS system. CO, defective sites and vanadium oxides on the surface of VOX-CNT contributed to the generation of activate species. Oxidizer dosage, catalyst dosage, water-soil ratio and soil properties would affect the degradation of 17β-E2. The ecotoxicological impact on soil caused by VOX-CNT/PDS was acceptable, and would be weakened with time. Additionally, a rapid decrease in the concentration of 17β-E2 and the promotion of maize growth were observed with VOX-CNT/PDS in situ pilot-scale remediation. Those results reveal that VOX-CNT/PDS is a potential technology to remove excessive steroid hormone from soil around large-scale livestock and poultry farms."

This paper describes a field survey in the Netherlands in which information on soil, cultivar, green manure, tillage as well as sowing, emergence, flowering and harvest dates of silage maize were collected from 148 growers. A small number of these growers (42 in total) were visited to collect maize samples revealing that 50% of the samples were contaminated with Fusarium species and mycotoxins were detected in 25% of the samples. The Fusarium species that was most commonly found was F. crookwellense followed by F. graminearum, F. culmorum, F. sporotrichiodes and F. equiseti. In total 31 mycotoxins were analysed. The predominant mycotoxins present were (sum of 3 and 15)-acetyl-DON and nivalenol; other mycotoxins found were alternariol, beauvericin, deoxynivalenol, diacetoxyscirpenol, moniliformin and zearalenone.

Sensitive and reliable quantification of ZEN in food is critical to ensure food safety and safeguard agricultural production. Herein, by combining the metal-organic frameworks-based nanozyme (MOFzyme) and hyaluronic acid (HA)-DNA hydrogel, a well-designed colorimetric aptasensor was developed. The HA-DNA hydrogel was deposited on the surface of the bimetallic MOFzyme via strand-induced hybridization chain reaction (HCR). Relying on the ZEN-specific aptamer integrated in hydrogel structure, the disintegration of the hydrogel network and the concomitant exposure of the encapsulated MOFzyme could be specifically triggered by the introduction of ZEN molecules. Moreover, the magnitude of hydrogel disintegration was positively correlated with the amount of ZEN, by which the quantification of ZEN can be effortlessly achieved. Benefiting from the delicate design, the satisfactory catalytic performance and stability of bimetallic MOFzyme and the appealing stimuli-responsiveness of DNA hydrogel, the developed aptasensor demonstrated superior analytical performance and ease of use. Under optimal conditions, the linear range of the aptasensor fell between 0.001 and 200 ng mL-1 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.8 pg mL-1. Furthermore, the aptasensor was successfully applied for the quantitative detection of ZEN in corn and soybean samples with recoveries ranging from 94.0% to 109.0%.

The P-P method draws sampling values from distribution functions fitted to consumption and contamination datasets. Moreover, to quantify the accuracy and reliability of the statistical estimates, we built related confidence intervals using a Pseudo-Parametric bootstrap method.

Once identified, these contaminated kernels can be manually removed by the user. The device consists of a fluorescence excitation light source, a tablet for image acquisition, and detection/visualization software. Two experiments using maize kernels artificially infected with toxigenic Aspergillus flavus were implemented to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the device. The first experiment utilized highly contaminated kernels (71.18 ppb), while mildly contaminated kernels (1.22 ppb) were used for the second experiment. Evidently, the combined approach of detection and sorting was effective in reducing aflatoxin levels in maize kernels. With a maize rejection rate of 1.02% and 1.34% in the two experiments, aflatoxin reduction was achieved at 99.3% and 40.7%, respectively. This study demonstrated the potential of using this low-cost and non-invasive fluorescence detection technology, followed by manual sorting, to significantly reduce aflatoxin levels in maize samples.

The species composition and prevalence of Fusarium species differed among the areas investigated. Fusarium species composition was as many as eight and as few as four in some growing area. The majority of the maize samples (77 %) were found positive for fumonisin, with concentrations ranging from 25 μg kg⁻¹ to 4500 μg kg⁻¹ (mean: 348 μg kg⁻¹ and median: 258 μg kg⁻¹). Slight variation in fumonisin concentration was also observed among areas. Overall results indicate widespread occurrence of several Fusarium species and contamination by fumonisin mycotoxins. These findings are useful for intervention measures to reduce the impact of the main fungal species and their associated mycotoxins, by creating awareness and implementation of good agricultural practices."

Until recently, organic fertilizers and soil amendments have largely been based on the practices of returning crop residues, manures and related agricultural wastes back to crop production areas. One rapidly growing segment in commercial organic fertilizer development is the use of spent microbial biomass (SMB) from industrial fermentation processes. While SMB is widely accepted in many organic farming systems (OFS), little is known concerning the effectiveness, environmental impact, and influence on prokaryotic communities in soils receiving this treatment. In this study, a comparative analysis of bacterial communities associated with OFS and conventional farming systems was performed over a growing season for a field containing yellow dent corn (Zea mays). A statistically significant increase in microbial population α-diversity, along with a strong recruitment of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria populations, was observed in soils treated with SMB when compared to areas in the field that utilized conventional farmer practices. These phyla are members of the copiotrophic subgroup, and considered a signature for the use of traditional organic fertilizers. These results provide valuable new information that SMB functions similarly to traditional organic fertilizers in promoting a high level of functional prokaryotic diversity and plant growth-promoting bacteria, but in contrast do not contribute directly to viable microorganisms in the soil due to the sterilization of SMB prior to land application."

The results showed that drip irrigation had a longer persistence period than spraying, and there was a hysteresis in the absorption distribution of the agent in different parts of corn, which was gradually transferred to the leaves after absorption from the roots. The average TE1 (transfer efficiency) and TE2 were 0.230-0.261 and 1.749-1.851 for TCAP and 0.168-0.187 and 2.363-2.815 for CNAP, respectively.

We found no adverse effects on development and survival when H. axyridis larvae were fed S. frugiperda larvae that had fed on Cry1Ab maize tissue. Presence of Cry1Ab in H. axyridis decreased considerably after switching to another diet within 48 h. In a no-choice assay, H. axyridis larvae consumed more Bt-fed S. frugiperda than non-Bt-fed larvae. Preference for S. frugiperda feeding on Bt maize was confirmed in subsequent choice assays with H. axyridis predation on Bt-fed, 1-5-d-old S. frugiperda larvae. We suggest that H. axyridis preferred prey, not based on whether it had fed on Bt or non-Bt maize, but rather on larval mass, and they compensated for the nutritional deficiency of lighter larvae through increased consumption. Pest larvae with variable levels of resistance developing on Bt diet are often stunted versus sensitive larvae developing on non-Bt diet. It is possible that such larvae may be preferentially removed from local field populations. These results may have implications for insect resistance management and may be played out under field conditions where seed blends of Bt and non-Bt hybrids are planted."

Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) also compromises the health of millions of maize consumers in several regions of the world including large parts of sub-Saharan Africa. We investigated whether provitamin A (proVA) enriched maize can simultaneously contribute to alleviate both of these health concerns. We studied aflatoxin accumulation in grain of 120 maize hybrids formed by crossing 3 Aspergillus flavus resistant and three susceptible lines with 20 orange maize lines with low to high carotenoids concentrations. The hybrids were grown in replicated, artificially-inoculated field trials at five environments. Grain of hybrids with larger concentrations of beta-carotene (BC), beta-cryptoxanthin (BCX) and total proVA had significantly less aflatoxin contamination than hybrids with lower carotenoids concentrations. Aflatoxin contamination had negative genetic correlation with BCX (-0.28, p < 0.01), BC (-0.18, p < 0.05), and proVA (-0.23, p < 0.05). The relative ease of breeding for increased proVA carotenoid concentrations as compared to breeding for aflatoxin resistance in maize suggests using the former as a component of strategies to combat aflatoxin contamination problems for maize.

The Midwest region of the United States, which includes Nebraska, is one of the leading regions for high nitrate-N concentrations and agrochemicals, including atrazine, in surface waters. Therefore, the objective of this study was to provide a case study for completing an environmental risk analysis for the potential exposure of atrazine and nitrate-N to ecosystems and humans through interaction with surface waters using two approaches: (1) Identify watersheds across Nebraska that were at risk for exceeding atrazine and nitrate-N maximum contaminant limits (MCLs) in surface water; and (2) Determine the specific times of year where risks were greatest. Factors were then analyzed using Geographic Information System (GIS) software to identify areas of high risk. Impairments for both nitrate-N and atrazine in the surface water were found predominately during the early growing season in the southeastern region of Nebraska, in watershed areas with the highest amount of corn production and annual precipitation. Further, the methodology developed in this study has the potential for application in regions with higher dependency on surface water to determine multiple agrochemical load influxes from upstream regions and evaluate other surface water contaminants during the same time periods."

We studied how three agronomic factors (crop diversification, tillage system and nitrogen fertilization rate) can affect fungal and mycotoxin contamination (deoxynivalenol and fumonisins B1 and B2) in maize at harvest. In addition, changes in maize during a simulated harvest-till-drying period were studied. DON content at harvest was higher for maize under intensive tillage than using direct drilling (2695 and 474 μg kg-1, respectively). We found two reasons for this: (i) soil crusting in intensive tillage plots caused the formation of pools of water that created high air humidity conditions, favouring the development of DON-producing moulds; (ii) the population of Lumbricus terrestris, an earthworm that would indirectly minimize fungal infection and mycotoxin production on maize kernels, is reduced in intensive tillage plots. Therefore, direct drilling is a better approach than intensive tillage for both preventing DON contamination and preserving soil quality. Concerning the simulated harvest-till-drying period, DON significantly increased between storage days 0 and 5. Water activity dropped on the 4th day, below the threshold for DON production (around 0.91).

According to fungal physiological particularities, mycotoxins can contaminate crops before harvest or during storage. Among toxins that represent a real public health issue, those produced by Fusarium genus in cereals before harvest are of great importance since they are the most frequent in European productions. Among them, deoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisins (FUM) frequently contaminate maize. In recent years, numerous studies have investigated whether food processing techniques can be exploited to reduce the levels of these two mycotoxins, which would allow the identification and quantification of parameters affecting mycotoxin stability. The particularity of the popcorn process is that it associates heat treatment with a particular physical phenomenon (i. e. , expansion). Three methods exist to implement the popcorn transformation process: hot air, hot oil, and microwaves, all of which are tested in this study. The results show that all popping modes significantly reduce FUM contents in both Mushroom and Butterfly types of popcorn. The mean initial contamination of 1351 µg/kg was reduced by 91% on average after popping. For DON, the reduction was less important despite a lower initial contamination than for FUM (560 µg/kg). Only the hot oil popping for the Mushroom type significantly reduced the contamination up to 78% compared to unpopped controls. Hot oil popping appears to provide the most important reduction for the two considered mycotoxins for both types of popcorn (-98% and -58% average reduction for FUM and DON, respectively)."

Despite their acceptance in agriculture, these herbicides can be dangerous to the environment, depending on their toxicity, the degree of contamination, and the duration of exposure. Controlled release systems are increasingly used to mitigate problems of toxicity and minimize environmental impacts, and can also increase herbicide efficiency. The objective of this work was to prepare poly(epsilon-caprolactone) nanocapsules containing ametryn and atrazine, and evaluate their toxicity to aquatic organisms as well as in cytogenetic tests employing human lymphocyte cultures. The PCL nanocapsules were prepared according to the interfacial deposition of pre-formed polymer method. Ecotoxicological assays were performed with the alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the microcrustacean Daphnia similis. The cytogenetic tests consisted of observing mitotic index alterations after exposing lymphocyte cell cultures to different formulations. Encapsulation of the herbicides in the nanocapsules resulted in lower toxicity to the alga and higher toxicity to the microcrustacean, compared to the herbicides alone. The cytogenetic tests showed that formulations of nanocapsules containing the herbicides were less toxic than the herbicides alone. The findings indicate the potential of the nanocapsule formulations in agricultural applications, where they could help to reduce the quantities of herbicides used as well as impacts on the environment and human health."

Logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation was used to develop models to predict the risk of DON ≥1 ppm. The presence and severity of GER predicted DON risk with an accuracy of 0.81 and 0.87, respectively. Temperature, relative humidity, surface wetness, and rainfall were used to generate 37 weather-based predictor variables summarized over each of six 15-day windows relative to maize silking (R1). With these variables, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) followed by all-subsets variable selection and logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation were used to build single-window weather-based models, from which 11 with one or two predictors were selected based on performance metrics and simplicity. LASSO logistic regression was also used to build more complex multiwindow models with up to 22 predictors. The performance of the best single-window models was comparable to that of the best multiwindow models, with accuracy ranging from 0.81 to 0.83 for the former and 0.83 to 0.87 for the latter group of models. These results indicated that the risk of DON ≥1 ppm can be accurately predicted with simple models built using temperature- and moisture-based predictors from a single window.

There is limited documentation on the occurrence of mycotoxins in sub-Saharan African countries, leading to the exposure of their populations to a wide variety of mycotoxins through consumption of contaminated foods. This review aims at highlighting the current status of mycotoxin contamination of food products in Zimbabwe and recommended strategies of reducing this problem. Zimbabwe is one of the African countries with very little information with regards to mycotoxin contamination of its food commodities, both on the market and at household levels. Even though evidence of multitoxin occurrence in some food commodities such as maize and other staple foods exist, available published research focuses only on Aspergillus and Fusarium mycotoxins, namely aflatoxins, deoxynivalenol (DON), trichothecenes, fumonisins, and zearalenone (ZEA). Occurrence of mycotoxins in the food chain has been mainly associated with poor agricultural practices. Analysis of mycotoxins has been done mainly using chromatographic and immunological methods. Zimbabwe has adopted European standards, but the legislation is quite flexible, with testing for mycotoxin contamination in food commodities being done voluntarily or upon request. Therefore, the country needs to tighten its legislation as well as adopt stricter standards that will improve the food safety and security of the masses."

We explored potential consequences of both insect resistant (IR) and herbicide resistant (HR) transgenic maize. IR maize can produce pollen that is toxic to lepidopteran larvae, and this puts butterfly species at possible risk if the presence of young larvae coincides with maize flowering, during which large quantities of maize pollen can be deposited on vegetation. By considering the timing of maize flowering in Europe and the phenology of the protected Lepidoptera species, we found that 31 species had at least one generation where 50% of the larval stage overlapped with maize flowering, and 69 species for which first instar larvae were present during maize pollen shedding. HR maize allows high concentration herbicide treatments on fields without seasonal limitation, which can drastically reduce weed densities. In cases where such weed species are host plants for protected butterflies, reduced host plant/food availability can result, causing population decreases. By using published information, we first identified the important weed species in major maize-growing European countries. Subsequently, we checked whether the host plants of protected Lepidoptera included species that are common maize weeds. We identified 140 protected species having food plants that are common weeds in one or more of the major European maize-growing countries. If HR maize is grown in Europe, there is a potential hazard that their food plants will seriously decline, causing a subsequent decline of these protected species."

Moreover, the biological accumulation of Cd and Cu in the grains of rapeseed and corn significantly decreased after biochar application. Linear regression also confirmed the effective role of biochar in controlling the translocation and accumulation of Cd and Cu due to their inactive bioavailability. In addition, the sequential extraction indicated that exchangeable fraction (EXF) of Cu and Cd had decreased, while residual fraction (RSF) had increased under all biochar amendments. Contrarily, the oxidizable fraction (OXF) of Cd decreased while OXF of Cu increased under biochar treatments.

Crops expressing Cry toxins might affect Lepidoptera larvae living outside cultivated fields, through pollen deposition on wild plants, which constitute their food source. While pollen toxicity varies among different events, possible exposure of nontarget species depends on the agro-environmental conditions. This study was conducted in two protected areas in Italy, characterized by different climatic conditions, where many Lepidoptera species thrive in proximity to maize cultivations. To estimate the possible exposure in absence of the actual stressor (e. g. , Cry1-expressing maize plants), we conducted a two-year field survey of butterflies and weeds. Indicator species were selected-Aglais (Inachis) io in the Northern site and Vanessa cardui in the Southern site-and their phenology was investigated. Pollen dispersal from maize fields was measured by collection in Petri dishes. Duration and frequency of exposure was defined by the overlap between pollen emission and presence of larvae on host plants. Different risk scenarios are expected in the two regions: highest exposure is foreseen for A. io in the Northern site, while minimal exposure is estimated for V. cardui in the Southern site. In the latter case, locally grown maize cultivars flower in mid-summer in coincidence with an aestivation period for several butterfly species due to hot and dry conditions. Moreover, host plants of V. cardui are at the end of their life cycle thus limiting food availability."

Amplicons of 170, 750 and 490 bp respectively for the corresponding primer pairs were detected; thus amplicon length is diagnostic for the individual fungal genus. The sensitivity of the developed method was tested with genomic DNA obtained from mould pure cultures and artificially contaminated maize grain powder. The sensitivity result showed that spore concentrations in the contaminated maize grain powder of 102 spores/mL were detected without prior incubation. This result suggests that the developed mPCR assay would allow a rapid, specific and simultaneous detection of various mycotoxigenic potential fungi based on the occurrence and size of the amplification products and thus to estimate the multi-mycotoxins contamination potential in food and feedstuff."

Simulation results indicate that preserving crop stalks until land is prepared by zone tillage for the next year's crop in lieu of using them as a source of heating fuel or livestock fodder significantly reduces wind erosion by 60%. At the same time, grain and potato (Solanum tuberosum L. ) yields were maintained or improved. Significant reductions in erosion, 35 to 46%, also resulted from delaying stalk removal until late January through late April. Yearly wind erosion was concentrated in April and May, the windiest months. Additionally, the use of alternative crop rotations resulted in differences in wind erosion, largely due to a difference in residue stature and quality and differences in biomass produced. As a result, altering current crop rotation systems by expanding corn (Zea mays L. ), wheat (Triticum aestivum L. ), and millet [Sorghum bicolor (L. ) Moench] and reducing potato and pea (Pisum sativum L. ) production significantly reduced simulated wind erosion, thus diminishing the severity of dust and sand storms in northwestern China.

The levels of TMs were measured by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. The mean levels of Ni, Cu, Cd, Cr, As and Zn in all crops were below maximum permissible concentrations (MPCs), while those of Pb in pepper (0.109 mg/kg fw), eggplant (0.103 mg/kg fw) and green bean (0.177 mg/kg fw) slightly exceeded MPCs (0.1 mg/kg fw). Leafy vegetables had relatively higher concentrations of Al, As, Ba, Cr, Cu, Fe and Mn compared to fruiting vegetables and maize. The estimated daily intake value of each TM estimated for each crop was found to be below the tolerable daily intake value. The target hazard quotients of all TMs in all crops did not exceed the acceptable non-carcinogenic risk level. However, hazard index (HI) value (1.57) in tomato was found to be above the threshold value of 1, indicating non-carcinogenic risks for consumers due to the intake of combined TMs in tomato. The THQ values of As, Co and Pb contributed 46.4%, 24.5% and 16.4% of the HI value of tomato, respectively. High daily consumption amount of tomato likely resulted in high HI value. The findings obtained in this study reveal that even if the levels of TMs in vegetables are safe, more attention should be paid to non-carcinogenic risks associated with TMs as a result of high vegetable intake."

It is generally accepted that maternal prenatal folic acid supplementation (FA) may beneficially impact offspring development, but it has been recently shown that the father's exposures also influence the health of his offspring. Bone is an endocrine organ essential for whole-body homeostasis and is susceptible to toxicants. Herein, we tested the hypotheses that prenatal paternal exposure to POPs induces developmental bone disorders in fetuses across multiple generations and that FA supplementation attenuates these disorders. We used a four-generation rat model, in which F0 founder females were divided into four treatment groups. F0 females were gavaged with corn oil or an environmentally-relevant POPs mixture and fed either a control diet (2 mg FA/kg), or FA supplemented diet (6 mg FA/kg) before mating and until parturition (four treatments in total). After the birth of the F1 litters, all F0 females and subsequent generations received the FA control diet. Staining with alcian blue and alizarin red S of male and female fetal skeletons was performed at Gestational Day 19.5. Paternal direct and ancestral exposure to POPs delayed bone ossification and decreased the length of long limb bones in fetuses. Maternal FA supplementation did not counteract the POPs-associated delayed fetal ossification and reduced long bone length. In conclusion, prenatal paternal POPs exposure causes developmental bone abnormalities over multiple generations, which were not corrected by maternal FA supplementation."

A conceptual approach based on Geographic Information System (GIS) technology has been developed to identify areas that are vulnerable to nontarget chemical exposure. This GIS-based approach uses wind speed, frequency of those winds, pesticide application rates, and spatial location of agricultural crops to identify areas with the highest potential for pesticide exposure. A test scenario based on an incident in Idaho (USA) was used to identify the relative magnitude of risk from off-target movement of herbicides to plants in the conterminous United States. This analysis indicated that the western portion of the Corn Belt, the central California valley, southeastern Washington, the Willamette Valley of Oregon, and agricultural areas bordering the Great Lakes are among those areas in the United States that appear to have the greatest potential for off-target movement of herbicides via drift. Agricultural areas, such as the Mississippi River Valley and the southeastern United States, appears to have less potential, possibly due to lower average wind speeds.

We developed a network model of maize trade around the world. From maize import/export data for 217 nations from 2000-2009, we calculated basic statistics on volumes of trade; then examined how regulations of aflatoxin, a common contaminant of maize, are similar or different between pairs of nations engaging in significant amounts of maize trade. Globally, market segregation appears to occur among clusters of nations. The United States is at the center of one cluster; European countries make up another cluster with hardly any maize trade with the US; and Argentina, Brazil, and China export maize all over the world. Pairs of nations trading large amounts of maize have very similar aflatoxin regulations: nations with strict standards tend to trade maize with each other, while nations with more relaxed standards tend to trade maize with each other. Rarely among the top pairs of maize-trading nations do total aflatoxin standards (standards based on the sum of the levels of aflatoxins B(1), B(2), G(1), and G(2)) differ by more than 5 µg/kg.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of traditional harvest and post-harvest practices on the proliferation of F. verticillioides and fumonisins contamination in post-harvest maize of two ethnic groups: Ede and Kinh from the central highlands of Vietnam. In parallel with analysis, a survey on harvest and post-harvest practices of these farmers was conducted from late December 2017 to early January 2019. As a result, four effective post-harvest practices at mitigating the contamination were defined: (1) removal of damaged cobs at harvest, (2) transport of maize home after harvest, (3) shelling maize away from fields, and (4) drying maize on cement yards. These practices were better implemented by Kinh households than Ede households reducing the post-harvest contamination of maize with F. verticillioides and fumonisin B1 (FB1), FB2, and FB3. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement with respect to inadequate open-air drying method, poor storage infrastructure, and poor moisture content management as these correlated to the proliferation of F. verticillioides.

After 10d of oral exposure, NDL-PCBs in adipose tissue, liver and muscles were analyzed by GC-MS, after extraction and purification. Two distinct groups of treatments were found: on the one hand oil, SS and FA, on the other hand C and AC.

A highly reactive scFv antibody specific to soluble cell wall-bound proteins (SCWPs) of F. verticillioides was selected from an immunized chicken phagemid library by phage display. The antibody was verified to bind on the surface of ungerminated conidiospores and mycelia of F. verticillioides. The scFv-AP fusion was constructed, and soluble expression in bacteria was confirmed. Both the antibody properties and enzymatic activity were retained, and the antigen-binding capacity of the fusion was enhanced by the addition of a linker. Surface plasmon resonance measurements confirmed that the fusion displayed 4-fold higher affinity compared with the fusion's parental scFv antibody. Immunoblot analyses showed that the fusion had good binding capacity to the components from SCWPs of F. verticillioides, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed that the detection limit of the fungus was below 10(-2) μg mL(-1), superior to the scFv antibody.

There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between mean fumonisin (FB1 + FB2) levels in transgenic (1130 μg/kg) and non-transgenic (920 μg/kg) whole corn. However, in non-transgenic germ, endosperm and corn meal fraction fumonisin levels were higher (2940 μg/kg, 250 μg/kg and 190 μg/kg, respectively) than in transgenic fractions (2180 μg/kg, 130 μg/kg and 85.0 μg/kg, respectively). Furthermore, the highest percentages of fumonisins were distributed in the germ, corresponding to about 87 and 76% of the total fumonisins present in the whole corn from non-transgenic and transgenic hybrids, respectively. Concerning the endosperm from non-transgenic and transgenic corn, approximately, 23% and 13% of the total fumonisins were retained after the dry milling. Further processing in corn meal (300 to 420 μm particle size) and grits (590 to 1190 μm) decreased the percentages of remaining fumonisins to 4% and 2% (transgenic) and 10% and 3% (non-transgenic corn), respectively. These results suggested that fumonisin concentration was higher in outer and inner non-transgenic fractions when compared to transgenic ones and that the fate of fumonisins during the industrial dry milling could be affected by the transgenic status. However, it was not possible to conclude that the difference was exclusively due to this variable."

Our goal was to assess risk associated with transgenic corn debris entering streams. First, we show the input of corn tissue after harvest was extended over months in a stream. Second, using laboratory bioassays based on European corn borer [Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner)], we found no bioactivity of Cry1Ab protein in senesced corn tissue after 2 wk of exposure to terrestrial or aquatic environments. Third, we show that Bt near-isolines modify growth and survivorship of some species of invertebrates. Of the four nontarget invertebrate species fed Bt near-isolines, growth of two closely related trichopterans was not negatively affected, whereas a tipulid crane fly exhibited reduced growth rates, and an isopod exhibited reduced growth and survivorship on the Cry1Ab near-isoline but not on the stacked Cry1Ab + Cry3Bb1 near-isoline. Because of lack of evidence of bioactivity of Bt after 2 wk and because of lack of nontarget effects on the stacked near-isoline, we suggest that tissue-mediated differences, and not the presence of the Cry1Ab protein, caused the different responses among the species. Overall, our results provide evidence that adverse effects to aquatic nontarget shredders involve complex interactions arising from plant genetics and environment that cannot be ascribed to the presence of Cry1Ab proteins."

Fungal species misidentification can dramatically impact biodiversity assessment, ecological studies, management decisions, and, concerning toxigenic fungi, health risk assessment, since they can produce a wide range of toxic secondary metabolites, referred to as mycotoxins. Since each toxigenic fungal species can have its own mycotoxin profile, a correct species identification, hereby attempted with universal DNA barcoding approach, could have a key role in mycotoxins prevention strategies. Currently, identification of single marker for species resolution in fungi has not been achieved and the analysis of multiple genes is used, with the advantage of an accurate species identification and disadvantage of difficult setting up of PCR-based diagnostic assays.

Biochar, a potential green and cost-efficient amendment material, affects As mobility/phytoavailability in soil and As accumulation in rice plants to some extent, which remains unclear. Thus, three different biochars derived from rice straw, corn stalks, and bamboo were used to investigate the impacts of biochar amendments on As mobility/phytoavailability in As-contaminated soil using pot and microcosm experiments. The results showed a limited reduction (by 12-16%) in As accumulation in rice grains under a low-dose (0.5%, w/w) biochar amendment, although the three biochars displayed different physicochemical properties. In addition, the biochar amendments did not significantly decrease the As levels in the straw and roots, potentially because of the small changes in As mobility/phytoavailability in amended soil relative to the control. However, As levels in soil solution in the biochar treatment groups increased substantially, by 2.8-6.6 times, with increasing biochar doses (0.5-5%, w/w) in microcosm-based anaerobic incubation experiments, particularly at higher doses (3-5%, w/w). These results could be attributed to the biochar-enhancing activity of As(V)-/Fe(III)-reducing bacteria at a high biochar application rate. Our results suggested that applying high biochar doses may increase the release of As into the soil, resulting in As accumulation in rice plants. Therefore, to mitigate the health risk of As in As-contaminated paddy soils, the remediation technologies from biochar methods should be subjected to more evaluation."

However, Western societies rarely experience insects as a food source. To overcome initial resistance, researchers have suggested introducing insects into the market in a processed form so that those characteristics which are repellent to Western consumers are no longer readily visible. Thus far, the success of this strategy is untested. For the present experiment, we used two kinds of tortilla chips. One was made with a traditional corn flour recipe, while the other included cricket flour as an ingredient. People from the general population (N=104) were randomly assigned to consume either the traditional chips (control condition) or the cricket chips (experimental condition). After answering questions related to their eating behaviours, the participants tasted the chips. Both groups were informed prior to the tasting what kind of chips they would be sampling. After the tasting, the participants were questioned again to assess their willingness to eat unprocessed insects. Multiple linear regression showed that the experimental condition (β=.16) had a significant effect on willingness to eat unprocessed insects, while simultaneously controlling for the impact of previous insect consumption (β=.36), food neophobia (β=−.33) and animal-based food contamination disgust (β=−.17). People in the experimental condition reported a higher willingness to eat unprocessed insects than people in the control condition. The present experiment showed that exposure to processed insect products can increase consumers’ willingness to consume unprocessed insects."

To practically compare these two different types of analytical strategies, we applied them for the detection of (i) 97 organophosphate (OP) and carbamate (CM) pesticide residues in wheat flour and (ii) carbofuran (a carbamate insecticide) in wheat, rye and maize flour samples. Regarding high-end analysis, an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ-MS) method was developed and validated achieving low limits of quantification (LOQs, from 0.002 to 0.040 mg kg-1) and a short chromatographic run (12 min). In terms of bioanalytical methods, a fast (17 min) and cost-efficient (∼0.01€ per sample) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) microplate assay for carbofuran screening was utilized. Importantly, carbofuran was the strongest of the 11 OP and CM tested pesticides achieving a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.021 μM whilst the assay detectability was at the parts per billion level in all three cereal matrices.

To remove Cd from contaminated soil surrounding a coal gangue pile area, loofah, oak chips, and corn stalks were used as raw materials to prepare loofah hydrothermal carbon (LH), oak chip hydrothermal carbon (OH), corn stalk hydrothermal carbon (CH). Next, LH, OH, and CH were modified using multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to obtain loofah-, oak-chip-, and corn-stalk-MWCNTs hydrothermal carbon composites (LMH, OMH, and CMH). The loofah hydrothermal carbon with excellent pore structure, specific surface area and pore capacity was selected, and the loading of MWCNTs was varied to give it better adsorption performance. The N2 adsorption-desorption experiments showed that the specific surface area and pore volume of LMH, OMH and CMH were significantly higher than those of LH, OH and CH, respectively. The specific surface area and pore volume of LMH are 101.948 m2 g-1 and 6.226 cm3 g-1, respectively. By EDS analysis and infrared spectroscopy, it can be seen that LMH has more o-containing functional groups than OMH and CMH.

The human outbreak began during the same crop year as epizootics attributed to exposure to fumonisin, a mycotoxin that often contaminates corn. Because Mexican Americans in Texas consume large quantities of corn, primarily in the form of tortillas, they may be exposed to high levels of fumonisins. We examined whether or not maternal exposure to fumonisins increases the risk of NTDs in offspring using a population-based case-control study. We estimated fumonisin exposure from a postpartum sphinganine:sphingosine (sa:so) ratio, a biomarker for fumonisin exposure measured in maternal serum, and from maternal recall of periconceptional corn tortilla intake. After adjusting for confounders, moderate (301-400) compared with low (< or = 100) consumption of tortillas during the first trimester was associated with increased odds ratios (ORs) of having an NTD-affected pregnancy (OR = 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.3). No increased risks were observed at intakes higher than 400 tortillas (OR = 0.8 for 401-800, OR = 1.0 for > 800). Based on the postpartum sa:so ratio, increasing levels of fumonisin exposure were associated with increasing ORs for NTD occurrences, except for the highest exposure category (sa:so > 0.35). Our findings suggest that fumonisin exposure increases the risk of NTD, proportionate to dose, up to a threshold level, at which point fetal death may be more likely to occur. These results also call for population studies that can more directly measure individual fumonisin intakes and assess effects on the developing embryo."

To monitor the occurrence of mycotoxins in edible oils, it is important to develop analytical methods that can determine multiple mycotoxins in oil products. A stable isotope dilution LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous determination of 12 mycotoxins in five edible oil matrixes (canola, corn, olive, peanut, and soybean oil) was developed and validated. Methods: Prior to extraction, the oil samples were fortified with ¹³C uniformly labeled internal standards (¹³C-IS) for 12 target mycotoxins, followed by extraction and LC-MS/MS analysis. Quantitation was achieved using solvent-only calibration standards, relative response factors of ¹³C-IS, and target mycotoxins. Results: The majority of recoveries in oil for ochratoxin A and aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 fortified at 1, 10, and 100 ng/g as well as deoxynivalenol; fumonisins B1, B2, and B3; T-2 toxin; HT-2 toxin; and zearalenone fortified at 10, 100, and 1000 ng/g ranged from 80 to 120% with RSDs of <20%. The method LOQs ranged from 0.1 ng/g (aflatoxin B1) to 6.4 ng/g (zearalenone). Among 16 U. S. market samples, zearalenone was detected in three corn oil samples at 37, 185, and 317 ng/g, respectively. T-2 toxin was found in two corn oil samples at 7 and 10 ng/g, respectively. Conclusions: The method provides sufficient selectivity, sensitivity, accuracy, and repeatability to screen edible oils for regulated mycotoxins such as aflatoxins at low nanogram per gram concentrations without using conventional standard addition or matrix-matched calibration standards to correct for matrix effects."

However, lupine provokes allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. The presence of undeclared lupine residues in foods can pose a serious health risk to lupine-allergic individuals. Therefore, the objective of this research was to develop a sandwich-type ELISA for the detection of lupine residues in foods. Lupine flour derived from Lupinus albus was used to immunize 3 rabbits and a sheep. Pooled lupine-specific antibodies were partially purified from the sera by ammonium sulfate precipitation. A sandwich lupine ELISA with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1 ppm was developed by utilizing the rabbit antisera as the capture reagent and the sheep antiserum as the detector reagent. The binding of the antigen-antibody complex was visualized by the addition of commercial rabbit antisheep IgG antibody labeled with alkaline phosphatase with subsequent addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate to produce a colored product for quantification. Minor cross-reactivity was observed with soy (Glycine max) and black bean (Castanospermum australe). The performance of the lupine ELISA was evaluated in reference food standards (beef frankfurter and apple cinnamon muffin) and laboratory-prepared cooked frankfurters and corn muffins. The mean percent recovery for lupine spiked-frankfurters and corn muffins were 108.4%+/- 8.8% and 103.1%+/- 11.5%, respectively.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that benzenamine displayed strong inhibitory effects on the mycelial growth of A. flavus. In this study, we systematically investigated the inhibitory effects of benzenamine on the development, aflatoxin biosynthesis, and virulence in A. flavus, as well as the underlying mechanism. The results indicated that benzenamine exhibited great capacity to combat A. flavus at a concentration of 100 µL/L, leading to significantly decreased aflatoxin accumulation and colonization capacity in maize. The transcriptional profile revealed that 3589 genes show altered mRNA levels in the A. flavus after treatment with benzenamine, including 1890 down-regulated and 1699 up-regulated genes. Most of the differentially expressed genes participated in the biosynthesis and metabolism of amino acid, purine metabolism, and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. Additionally, the results brought us to a suggestion that benzenamine affects the development, aflatoxin biosynthesis, and pathogenicity of A. flavus via down-regulating related genes by depressing the expression of the global regulatory factor leaA. Overall, this study indicates that benzenamine have tremendous potential to act as a fumigant against pathogenic A. flavus. Furthermore, this work offers valuable information regarding the underlying antifungal mechanism of benzenamine against A. flavus at the level of transcription, and these potential targets may be conducive in developing new strategies for preventing aflatoxin contamination."

Analysis of milk using ELISA revealed high contamination with an overall average of 3164.5 ng of AFM1/L, and significant differences (p < 0.001) between cities. The milk sampled from Gilgit, in northern hilly areas, had an average AFM1 level of 92.5 ng/L. Milk from other cities had 3529.7 ng/L average contamination, with only 5.7% samples qualifying the maximum tolerable limit of 500 ng of AFM1/L. Heavy mean aflatoxin contamination was found in bakery waste (724.6 μg/kg), and cottonseed cake (600.8 μg/kg). Rest of the other feedstuffs had moderate to low mean aflatoxin contamination, ranging from 66.0 μg/kg in maize stover to 3.4 μg/kg in wheat bran. The mean aflatoxin level in commercial dairy concentrates was 32.7 µg/kg. About 80% of the total aflatoxin intake of dairy animals was contributed by cottonseed cake alone due to its high aflatoxin contamination and proportion in dairy rations. On-farm storage time of oilseed cakes varied (p < 0.01) in different cities but was not associated with aflatoxin contamination. The exceptionally high AFM1 contamination suggests that milk from peri-urban dairy farms is a serious public health threat in Pakistan.

Root dry weight, plant height and root length were significantly affected by Si addition. Root volume and average root diameter were significantly positively correlated with root Cd concentration, bioaccumulation and translocation factor, respectively, of two maize genotypes at the silking stage. Addition of Si significantly increased Cd concentration, content, bioconcentration and translocation factor in roots of Zhongke11, but reduced the values of these parameters in Shengrui9999 at both growth stages. Under Cd stress, grain Cd concentration in the Si treatment was decreased by 14.4% (Zhongke11) and 21.4% (Shengrui999) than that in non-Si treatment.

Production of a mixture of ENs was performed by culturing F. tricinctum ITEM 9496 on white corn as substrate. The solid culture components were dried and subsequently extracted with water/methanol (50/50 v/v, 0.5% NaCl), homogenised, filtered, extracted by ethyl acetate and analysed by liquid chromatography with diode array detection (LC-DAD). The crude extract was first separated by low pressure liquid chromatography (LPLC) and then further purified by liquid chromatography (LC), resulting in six compounds with a purity higher than 95% as calculated by (1)H NMR, and with a yield of 30-300mg per compound. The chemical structures of the ENs were determined by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The biological activity of the resulting ENs was determined using a mitochondrial respiration test. We discovered that all the ENs studied induced an increase in the mitochondrial respiration resulting in uncoupling of the oxidative phosphorylation. This effect was most likely due to flux of K(+) ions into the mitochondrial matrix. The order of potency of the ENs derivatives was: A1>B1>B>A>B4>J1.

The objective of this research was to determine the effect of amylose and resistant starch on fumonisin B1 (FB1) levels in extruded corn-based products as well as the toxin bioaccessibility upon digestion. Cornmeal contaminated with FB1 (1.5 µg/g) was extruded alone or combined with high-amylose corn starch (20%, w/w). FB1 was quantified both in the unextruded and extruded products by HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) fluorescence detector with pre-column derivatization. Samples were then subjected to an in vitro digestion model to evaluate the stability of the interaction between FB1 and the corn matrix extruded. The addition of high-amylose corn starch further reduced the detection of FB1 (74.9%), when compared with the effect of the extrusion alone (66.0%), confirming the binding of FB1 with the macromolecules or resistant starch. The bound fumonisin was stable upon simulated gastric digestion, and the duodenal bioaccessibility of free FB1 was lower than 35% when high-amylose corn starch ingredient was used in the product. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that high-amylose corn starch and resistant starch content influenced the reduction of FB1 and its duodenal bioaccessibility. This study for the first time shows that addition of high-amylose corn starch during extrusion is an innovative strategy to reduce FB1 release under digestive conditions, therefore useful in mitigating the exposure to this mycotoxin."

This review aimed to collect and synthesize the available evidence on geographical spread, scale of contamination, disease burden, economic impact, and mitigation measures for aflatoxins in Africa by way of a systematic literature review. This knowledge can enhance management strategies for the major challenges to combat aflatoxins. The search was conducted by applying a predefined search strategy, using bibliographic databases and websites, covering the period 2010 to 2018. Results showed that maize, peanuts, and animal feeds were the most studied commodities. For maize, all studies indicated mean AFB1 to exceed the European Union legal limit. From studies on contamination levels and biomarkers, it is clear that overall exposure is high, leading to a substantial increase in long-term disease burden. In addition, concentrations in food occasionally can reach very high levels, causing acute aflatoxicoses. The trade-related impact of aflatoxin contamination was mainly evaluated from the standpoint of aflatoxin regulation affecting products imported from Africa. There was a limited number of studies on health-related economic impacts, pointing out a gap in peer-reviewed literature. A number of mitigation measures have been developed, but proof of cost-effectiveness or even costs alone of the practices is often lacking. We recommend more emphasis to be put in peer-reviewed studies on evidence-based cost-effective mitigation strategies for aflatoxins, on the scale and spread of the problem and its impacts on public health and economics for use in evidence-based policies."

Heritability estimated on an entry mean basis was 0.75 for fumonisin concentration and 0.47 for ear rot resistance.

Correlations between fumonisin concentration and silking date were not significant in either population, and correlations between ear rot resistance and silking date were small (less than 0.30) in both populations. Moderate to high heritabilities and strong genetic correlations between ear rot and fumonisin concentration suggest that selection for reduced ear rot should frequently identify lines with reduced fumonisin concentration.

They are toxic to animals and at least one analogue, fumonisin B1, is carcinogenic to rodents. Their effect on human health is unclear, however, fumonisins are considered to be risk factors for cancer and possibly neural tube defects in some heavily exposed populations. It is therefore important to minimize exposures in these populations. Cleaning corn to remove damaged or moldy kernels reduces fumonisins in foods while milling increases their concentration in some and reduces their concentration in other products. Fumonisins are water-soluble and nixtamalization (cooking in alkaline water) lowers the fumonisin content of food products if the cooking liquid is discarded. Baking, frying, and extrusion cooking of corn at high temperatures ( > or = 190 degrees C) also reduces fumonisin concentrations in foods, with the amount of reduction achieved depending on cooking time, temperature, recipe, and other factors. However, the chemical fate of fumonisins in baked, fried, and extruded foods is not well understood and it is not known if the reduced concentrations result from thermal decomposition of fumonisins or from their binding to proteins, sugars or other compounds in food matrices. These possibilities might or might not be beneficial depending upon the bioavailability and inherent toxicity of decomposition products or the degree to which bound fumonisins are released in the gastrointestinal tract. In this review the affects of cooking and processing on the concentration and chemical structure of fumonisins as well as the toxicological consequences of known and likely fumonisin reaction products are discussed."

In this study, a peptide amphiphile (C14R5), composed of five arginine residues as the hydrophilic chain and myristic acid as the hydrophobic chain, inspired AuNPs to form monodispersed hollow raspberry-like AuNPs (rasAuNPs). rasAuNPs could captured and immobilized large amounts of aflatoxin antigens via the Au-S bonds, resulting in binding to more anti-aflatoxin antibodies. In the absence of aflatoxins, the enriched antigens bound to abundant antibodies, resulting in a low blank signal current. By contrast, in the presence of aflatoxins, enough antibodies could bind to the targets and less antibodies could recognize the antigens, increasing the detection signal intensity.

The model was applied to a case study where RWW (originating from a municipal wastewater treatment plant) is discharged into a water channel, with subsequent irrigation of silage maize, rice, wheat and ryegrass. Environmental and human health risks were assessed for 13 CECs, selected based on their chemical and hazard characteristics. Predicted CEC concentrations in the channel showed good agreement with available measurements, indicating potential ecotoxicity of some CECs (estrogens and biocides) due to their limited attenuation. Plant uptake predictions were in good agreement with existing literature data, indicating higher uptake in leaves and roots than fruits. Notably, high uncertainties were shown for weakly acidic CECs, possibly due to degradation in soil and pH variations inside plants.

In order to assess exposure to these mycotoxins in the Bizana (now known as Mbizana) and Centane magisterial areas of the former Transkei region of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, the actual maize consumption by different age groups in these communities was measured. In the groups 1-9 years (n = 215) and 10-17 (n = 240) years, mean consumption (+/-standard error) was 246 +/- 10.8 and 368 +/- 10.3 g per person day(-1), respectively, with no significant difference (p > 0.05) between the magisterial areas. For adults (18-65 years) mean maize consumption in Bizana (n = 229) and Centane (n = 178) were significantly different (p < 0.05) at 379 +/- 10.5 and 456 +/- 11.9 g per person day(-1), respectively. An exposure assessment was performed by combining the maize consumption distribution with previously determined levels of total fumonisin (fumonisins B(1) and B(2) combined) contamination in home-grown maize in these two areas. Assuming an individual adult body weight of 60 kg, fumonisin exposure in Bizana, an area of relatively low oesophageal cancer incidence, was 3.43 +/- 0.15 microg kg(-1) body weight day(-1), which was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that in Centane (8.67 +/- 0.18 microg kg(-1) body weight day(-1)), an area of high oesophageal cancer incidence.

Crop contamination with those highly toxic and carcinogenic compounds impacts both human and animal health, as well as the income of farmers and trade. In Nigeria, poultry productivity is hindered by high prevalence of aflatoxins in feeds. A practical solution to decrease crop aflatoxin content is to use aflatoxin biocontrol products based on non-toxin-producing strains of A. flavus. The biocontrol product Aflasafe® was registered in 2014 for use in maize and groundnut grown in Nigeria. Its use allows the production of aflatoxin-safe maize and groundnut. A portion of the maize treated with Aflasafe in Nigeria is being used to manufacture feeds used by the poultry industry, and productivity is improving. One of the conditions to register Aflasafe with the national regulator was to demonstrate both the safety of Aflasafe-treated maize to avian species and the impact of Aflasafe as a public good. Results presented here demonstrate that the use of maize colonized by an atoxigenic strain of Aflasafe resulted in superior (p < 0.05) broiler performance in all evaluated parameters in comparison to broilers fed with toxigenic maize. Use of an aflatoxin-sequestering agent (ASA) was not sufficient to counteract the harmful effects of aflatoxins. Both the safety and public good value of Aflasafe were demonstrated during our study. In Nigeria, the availability of aflatoxin-safe crops as a result of using Aflasafe allows poultry producers to improve their productivity, their income, and the health of consumers of poultry products."

Several laboratory and field trials have been conducted in Spain since the late 1990s to assess this issue. A consideration in the design of field trials is whether it is necessary to sample most NTAs living in the crop or only representative taxa that perform main ecological functions and have a good capacity to detect small changes in their abundance. Small changes in the field abundance of an effective representative taxon should be detectable using standard experimental protocols. The ability of a species to reveal differences across treatments may be analysed by examining the detectable treatment effects for surveyed non-target organisms. Analysis of data from several NTAs recorded in 14 field trials conducted over 10 years using complete block designs allowed us to select a number of representative taxa capable of detecting changes in the density or activity of arthropod herbivores, predators, parasitoids and decomposers in transgenic and non-transgenic maize varieties. The most suitable NTA as representative taxa (with detectable treatment effects below 50%) included leafhoppers among arthropod herbivores, Orius spp. , Araneae, and Carabidae among predators, chalcidids, particularly the family Mymaridae, among parasitoids and Chloropidae as decomposer. Details of sampling techniques for each sampled taxa and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. It is concluded that abundance of taxa is the most influential factor determining their capacity to detect changes caused by genetically modified varieties."

Endogenous signal peptides from L. reuteri were first screened to achieve high expression for efficient ZEN hydrolysis. For secretion expression, signal peptide from collagen-binding protein showed the best performance, while the one from fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase worked best for surface-display expression. Both of the engineered strains could completely hydrolyze 5.0 mg/L ZEN in 8 h without detrimental effects on bacterial growth. The acid and bile tolerance assay and anchoring experiment on Caco-2 cells indicated both of the abovementioned engineered strains could survive during digestion and colonize on intestinal tract, in which the surface-displayed strain had a better performance on ZEN hydrolysis. Biodetoxification of model ZEN-contaminated maize kernels showed the surface-displayed L. reuteri strain could completely hydrolyze 2.5 mg/kg ZEN within 4 h under low water condition. The strain could also efficiently detoxify natural ZEN-contaminated corn flour in the in vitro digestion model system. The colonized property, survival capacity, and the efficient hydrolysis performance as well as probiotic functionality make L. reuteri strain an ideal host for detoxifying residual ZEN in vivo, which shows a great potential for application in feed industry."

In addition, the farmers' level of knowledge of the causes and consequences of contamination and the measures for prevention were also examined by administering questionnaires to a cross section of 150 farmers. The results showed the presence of aflatoxins in all samples, with levels ranging from 1.6 to 2,270 μg/kg. In 68% of all samples, total aflatoxin contamination was above 4 μg/kg, the maximum tolerable level set by the European Union. Farmers ranked high humidity, improper storage practices, and poor soils as potential causes of aflatoxin contamination and changes in color, smell, and taste, and difficulty in selling crops as consequences. They identified crop management practices as the most effective way to control contamination. The results also revealed that most farmers apply preharvest crop management practices as a means of controlling contamination. More educated households were more knowledgeable about aflatoxins. Female-headed and married households were less likely to be willing to pay for aflatoxin control. About 28% of farmers claimed to be willing to allocate resources to seed intervention while a smaller proportion agreed to pay for training and information services.

To employ portable readers in food safety, Pt-catalysis has attracted increasing attention due to its portability and reliability. In this study, we developed a sensitive point-of-care aflatoxin detection (POCAD) method via a portable handheld barometer. We synthesized and characterized Au@PtNPs and Au@PtNPs conjugated with a second antibody (Au@PtNPs-IgG). A competitive immunoassay was established based on the homemade monoclonal antibody against aflatoxins. Au@PtNPs-IgG was used to catalyze the production of O2 from H2O2 in a sealed vessel. The pressure of O2 was then recorded by a handheld barometer. The aflatoxin concentration was inversely proportional to the pressure recorded via the barometer reading. After optimization, a limit of detection of 0.03 ng/mL and a linear range from 0.09 to 16.0 ng/mL were achieved. Recovery was recorded as 83.1%-112.0% along with satisfactory results regarding inner- and inter-assay precision (relative standard deviation, RSD < 6.4%). Little cross-reaction was observed. Additionally, the POCAD was validated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by using peanut and corn samples.

Inoculation with this bioactive actinomycete strain decreased arsenic root and shoot bioaccumulation in both C3 and C4 crop species namely barley and maize. Upon arsenate treatment, N. lucentensis S5 stimulated root citric acid production and the plant's innate detoxification capacity in a species-specific manner. In addition, this specific strain promoted biomass gain, despite substantial tissue arsenic levels. Detoxification (metallothionein, phytochelatin, glutathione-S-transferase levels) was upregulated in arsenate-exposed shoot and roots, and this response was further enhanced upon S5 supplementation, particularly in barley and maize roots. Compared to barley, maize plants were more tolerant to arsenate-induced oxidative stress (less H2O2 and lipid peroxidation levels). However, barley plants invested more in antioxidative capacity induction (ascorbate-glutathione turnover) to mitigate arsenic oxidative stress, which was strongly enhanced by S5. We quantify and mechanistically discuss the physiological and biochemical basis of N. lucentensis-mediated plant biomass recovery on arsenate polluted soils.

Here, we quantitatively assess the impact of both Bt maize hybrids on pest feeding damage, crop yield and food safety throughout China's maize belt. Without a need to resort to synthetic insecticides, Bt maize could mitigate lepidopteran pest pressure by 61.9-97.3%, avoid yield loss by 16.4-21.3% (range -11.9-99.2%) and lower mycotoxin contamination by 85.5-95.5% as compared to the prevailing non-Bt hybrids. Yield loss avoidance varied considerably between experimental sites and years, as mediated by on-site infestation pressure and pest identity. For either seed mixtures or block refuge arrangements, pest pressure was kept below established thresholds at 90% Bt maize coverage in Yunnan (where S. frugiperda was the dominant species) and 70% Bt maize coverage in other sites dominated by Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) and Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenée). Drawing on experiences from other crop/pest systems, Bt maize in se can provide area-wide pest management and thus, contribute to a progressive phase-down of chemical pesticide use.

Ingestion of FB(1)-contaminated food is associated with increased risk for neural tube defects (NTDs). FB(1) induces NTDs in inbred LM/Bc mice. FB(1) inhibits ceramide synthase in de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis, resulting in accumulation of sphinganine and sphinganine-1-phosphate (Sa1P). Sa1P functions as a ligand for a family of G protein-coupled S1P receptors. Pregnant SWV and LM/Bc mice were treated with FB(1) (20 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally on embryonic day (ED) 7.5-8.5) or the known S1P receptor agonist FTY720 (10 mg/kg/day oral gavage on ED 6.5-8.5). LC/MS was used to detect sphingoid base-1-phosphates in maternal blood spots, plasma, and embryonic tissue. Strain-specific SWV and LM/Bc mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and serum free mouse embryo (SFME) neural progenitor cells were treated with FB(1) (40 μM for 24 hr) and LC/MS was used to detect sphingoid base-1-phosphates. FTY720 induced NTDs in both the SWV and the LM/Bc strains of mice. Sphinganine-1-P (Sa1P) and FTY720-P were elevated in the blood spots and plasma of mice treated with FB(1) or FTY720, respectively. FTY720-P was elevated in ED 9.5 exencephalic embryos. Sa1P was elevated in SFME and MEF cells treated with FB(1), and Sa1P was higher in MEFs generated from the FB(1)-NTD-susceptible LM/Bc strain. Elevated sphingoid base-1-P after FB(1) or FTY720 suggest a potential role for these bioactive lipid ligands and activation of S1P receptor signaling pathways in the failure of neural tube closure after FB(1) or FTY720.

Mycotoxins, natural contaminants produced by fungi, are among the most important of such hazards. Aflatoxins, which have the highest acute and chronic toxicity of all mycotoxins, assume particular importance. A recent study predicted aflatoxin contamination in maize and wheat crops in Europe within the next 100 years and aflatoxin B1 is predicted to become a food safety issue in Europe, especially in the most probable scenario of climate change (+2°C). This review discusses the potential influence of climate change on the health risk associated to aflatoxins dietary exposure of Portuguese population. We estimated the burden of disease associated to the current aflatoxin exposure for Portuguese population in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). It is expected that in the future the number of DALYs and the associated cases of hepatocellular carcinoma due to aflatoxins exposure will increase due to climate change. The topics highlighted through this review, including the potential impact on health of the Portuguese population through the dietary exposure to aflatoxins, should represent an alert for the potential consequences of an incompletely explored perspective of climate change. Politics and decision-makers should be involved and committed to implement effective measures to deal with climate change issues and to reduce its possible consequences. This review constitutes a contribution for the prioritisation of strategies to face the unequal burden of effects of weather-related hazards in Portugal and across Europe."

The objectives of this study were to determine the current status of incidence of ear rot causing fungi, which are associated with mycotoxin contamination, in southern African maize hybrids, and to check whether or not mycotoxin resistance genes can be stacked in a single product. The 327 hybrids were evaluated under natural conditions in replicated trials over two seasons at Cedara Research Station, which is hot spot site for ear rot diseases. Concurrently, aflatoxin and fumonisin resistant tropical maize inbred lines were crossed with South African adapted inbred lines. The resultant 72 single crosses were evaluated for fumonisin contamination, while 44 three-way crosses and their progenies (146 S₂:₃ families) were evaluated for both aflatoxin and fumonisin contamination under artificial inoculation. The Fusarium verticillioides was the most prevalent ear rot causing fungus, followed by Stenocarpella maydis, F. graminearum and Aspergillus flavus. The late maturing hybrids were more susceptible to ear rots contamination than their earlier counterparts. Stacking of mycotoxin contamination resistance genes was successful because five experimental single cross hybrids consistently accumulated low fumonisin levels (<4 ppm), both in the greenhouse and field trials. Three 3-way crosses displayed low contamination levels for both aflatoxins (<5 ppb) and fumonisins. Four S₂:₃ families accumulated low levels of both aflatoxins and fumonisins below the legal limits of 5 ppb and 4 ppm, respectively.

This global public health threat can be managed by breeding maize varieties that are resistant to colonization by F. verticillioides and by sorting grain after harvest to reduce fumonisin levels in food systems. Here, we employed two F. verticillioides inoculation techniques representing distinct infection pathways to dissect ear symptomatology and morphological resistance mechanisms in a diverse panel of maize inbred lines. The ""point"" method involved penetrating the ear with a spore-coated toothpick and the ""inundative"" method introduced a liquid spore suspension under the husk of the ear. We evaluated quantitative and qualitative indicators of external and internal symptom severity as low-cost proxies for fumonisin contamination, and found that kernel bulk density was predictive of fumonisin levels (78 to 84% sensitivity; 97 to 99% specificity). Inundative inoculation resulted in greater disease severity and fumonisin contamination than point inoculation. We also found that the two inoculation methods implicated different ear tissues in defense, with cob morphology being a more important component of resistance under point inoculation. Across both inoculation methods, traits related to cob size were positively associated with disease severity and fumonisin content. Our work demonstrates that (i) the use of diverse modes of inoculation is necessary for combining complementary mechanisms of genetic resistance, (ii) kernel bulk density can be used effectively as a proxy for fumonisin levels, and (iii) trade-offs may exist between yield potential and resistance to fumonisin contamination."

Comparison of vertical Hg soil profiles with As, Cu, Ni and Zn (which were not emitted by the plant) support Hg enrichment in surface horizons due to atmospheric Hg inputs from the chlor-alkali plant. Based on chemical extractions and elemental correlations, Hg was found to be weakly leachable and bio-available for plants, and most probably strongly bound to organic matter. In contrast, other trace elements were probably associated with phyllosilicates, iron oxides or with primary minerals. Hg stocks in the surface horizon of a forested soil (1255 mg Hg m(-3)) were two-fold higher than in an agricultural soil (636 mg Hg m(-3)) at a similar distance to the plant. The difference was attributed to the interception of atmospheric Hg by the canopy (most likely gaseous elemental Hg and reactive gaseous Hg) and subsequent litterfall incorporation. Some differences in the ability to trap atmospheric Hg were observed between tree species. The characterization of the litter showed an increasing Hg concentration in the plant material proportional to their degradation stage. In agricultural soils, very low Hg concentrations found in corn leaves and grains suggested a limited uptake via both the foliar and root pathways. Thus, the short-term risk of Hg transfer to agricultural crops and higher levels of the trophic chain appeared limited.

Among Fusarium toxins, deoxynivalenol (DON) is considered the most important contaminant in wheat due to its widespread occurrence. In the last years the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Commission have frequently expressed opinions on Fusarium toxins, setting limits, regulations and guidelines in order to reduce their levels in raw materials and food commodities. In particular, European legislation (Reg. 1881/2006) sets the maximum limit for DON in flour and bread as 750 and 500 microg kg(-1) respectively. Relatively few studies have taken into account the loss of trichothecenes during processing, focusing on how processing factors may influence their degradation. In particular, the description of DON behaviour during bread-making is very difficult, since complex physico-chemical modifications occur during the transformation of the raw ingredients into the final product. In the present study, we studied how DON concentration may be influenced by modifying bread-making parameters, with a special emphasis on the fermentation and baking stages, starting from a naturally contaminated flour at both pilot and industrial scales. Exploiting the power of a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach to consider the great complexity of the studied system, the obtained model shows satisfying goodness-of-fit and prediction, suggesting that the baking step (time/temperature ranges) is crucial for minimizing native DON level in bread."

AMF can reduce the toxicity of ZnO NPs, but the benefits of AMF to host plants highly vary with soil available P. We hypothesize that organic P may help AMF to alleviate ZnO NP phytotoxicity. Here, we investigated the effects of inoculation with Funneliformis mosseae on plant growth and Zn accumulation, using maize grown in soil-sand mix substrates spiked with ZnO NPs (0 or 500 mg kg-1) under different organic P supply levels (0, 20, or 50 mg kg-1). The results showed addition of ZnO NPs inhibited root colonization rate, increased the shoot/root P concentration ratio, and led to significant Zn accumulation in soil and plants. As predicted, AM effects on maize plants all varied with P supply levels, both with or without ZnO NP additions. Organic P interacted synergistically with AMF to promote plant growth and acquisition of P, N, K, Fe, and Cu. AM inoculation reduced the bioavailable Zn released from ZnO NPs and decreased the concentrations and translocation of Zn to maize shoots. In conclusion, ZnO NPs caused excess Zn in soil and plants, posing potential environmental risks.

The xylanolytic enzyme produced from B. firmus K-1 effectively degraded xylan in corn cob, which was examined by chemical composition, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). After cultivation, the xylan contained in the corn cob residue was decreased (as biological pretreatment), causing morphological and structural changes, including creating porosity and increasing the surface area and the exposure of cellulose of pretreated corn cob.

Here, we performed a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of two maize inbred lines with contrasting resistance to A. flavus infection. The pairwise comparisons between mock and infected kernels in each line during the first 6 h post inoculation (hpi) showed that maize resistance to A. flavus infection was specific to the genotype and infection stage, and defense pathways were strengthened in the resistant line. Further comparison of the two maize lines revealed that the infection-induced up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the resistant line might underlie the enhanced resistance. Gene co-expression network analysis by WGCNA (weighted gene co-expression network analysis) identified 7 modules that were significantly associated with different infection stages, and 110 hub genes of these modules.

The availability forms of Cd and Pb decreased by 1.07-10.0% and 2.92-8.35%, respectively. While the improvement on the status of the HMs accumulated by crops was disappointing. The contents of HMs accumulated by crops increased to varying degrees (e. g. , Pb and Zn in root, Cu and Pb in grain, and Cd in stems and leaves). Moreover, the concentrations of HMs in seeds of crops were higher than the limited levels given by the Chinese directive. Considering the results of the study and food safety, it is suggested to change the nature of the land around the smelter into woodland or construction land to prohibit the cultivation of food crops in this area."

Dietary exposure to aflatoxins is considered a major public health concern, especially for subsistence farming communities in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where dietary staple food crops such as groundnuts and maize are often highly contaminated with aflatoxin due to hot and humid climates and poor storage, together with low awareness of risk and lack of enforcement of regulatory limits. Biomarkers have been developed and applied in many epidemiological studies assessing aflatoxin exposure and the associated health effects in these high-risk population groups. This review discusses the recent epidemiological evidence for aflatoxin exposure, co-exposure with other mycotoxins and associated health effects in order to provide evidence on risk assessment, and highlight areas where further research is necessary. Aflatoxin exposure can occur at any stage of life and is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma, especially when hepatitis B infection is present. Recent evidence suggests that aflatoxin may be an underlying determinant of stunted child growth, and may lower cell-mediated immunity, thereby increasing disease susceptibility. However, a causal relationship between aflatoxin exposure and these latter adverse health outcomes has not been established, and the biological mechanisms for these have not been elucidated, prompting further research. Furthermore, there is a dearth of information regarding the health effects of co-exposure to aflatoxin with other mycotoxins. Recent developments of biomarkers provide opportunities for important future research in this area."

We sought to determine a noncarcinogenic tolerable daily intake (TDI) of aflatoxin, based on the existing data surrounding aflatoxin and biomarkers of immune suppression. To conduct the dose response assessment, mammalian studies were assessed for appropriateness of doses (relevant to potential human exposures) as well as goodness of data, and two appropriate mouse studies that examined decreases in leukocyte counts were selected to generate dose response curves. From these, we determined benchmark dose lower confidence limits (BMDL) as points of departure to estimate a range of TDIs for aflatoxin-related immune impairment: 0.017-0.082 μg/kg bw/day.

Challenges during the development of single kernel near infrared (SK-NIR) spectroscopy applications are modifications of existing NIR technology to present single kernels for scanning as well as modifying reference methods for the trait of interest. Numerous applications have been developed, and cover almost all cereals although most have been for key traits including moisture, protein, starch and oil in the globally important food grains, i. e. maize, wheat, rice and barley. An additional benefit in developing SK-NIR applications has been to demonstrate the value in sorting grain infected with a fungus or mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol, fumonisins and aflatoxins. However, there is still a need to develop cost-effective technologies for high-speed sorting which can be used for small grain samples such as those from breeding programmes or commercial sorting; capable of sorting tonnes per hour. Development of SK-NIR technologies also includes standardisation of SK reference methods to analyse single kernels. For protein content, the use of the Dumas method would require minimal standardisation; for starch or oil content, considerable development would be required. SK-NIR, including the use of hyperspectral imaging, will improve our understanding of grain quality and the inherent variation in the range of a trait. In the area of food safety, this technology will benefit farmers, industry and consumers if it enables contaminated grain to be removed from the human food chain."

Improving N fertilizer utilization efficiency and plant uptake is an alternative for N fertilizers overuses. Enterobacter cloacae is an opportunistic pathogen, also used as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), has been widely presented in the fields of bioremediation and bioprotection. Here we developed a new N fixation-release model by combining biochar with E. cloacae. The efficiency of the model was evaluated using a greenhouse pot experiment with maize (Zea mays L. ) as the test crop. The results showed that biochar combined with E. cloacae significantly increased the N content. The application of biochar combined with E. cloacae increased total N in soil by 33% compared with that of N fertilizers application. The N-uptake and utilization efficiency (NUE) in plant was increased 17.03% and 14.18%, respectively. The activities of urease, dehydrogenase and fluorescein diacetate hydrolase (FDA) was improved, the catalase (CAT) activity decreased. Analysis of the microbial community diversity revealed the abundance of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Gemmatimonadetes were significantly improved. The mechanism under the model is that E. cloacae acted as N-fixation by capturing N2 from air. Biochar served as carrier, supporting better living environment for E. cloacae, also as adsorbent adsorbing N from fertilizer and from fixed N by E. cloacae, the adsorption in turn slower the N release. Altogether, the model promotes N utilization by plants, improves the soil environment, and reduces N pollution."

Pesticides, by nature are poisonous and exposure of humans to their residues may cause health hazards which include neurotoxicity and carcinogenicity among others. Evaluation of pesticide residues in food is therefore of public health importance and would help to ensure that levels are kept within safety limits. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and quantity of organochlorine pesticide residues in maize samples collected from various markets in Lagos State and compare values obtained with established safety values in order to highlight possible health hazards. In this study, samples of white maize (Zea mays L. ) purchased from different markets in Lagos State were analyzed for residues of organochlorine pesticides using gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric detector (GC-MS) after careful extraction and cleanup. The results showed that 96% of the maize samples contained residues of one or more organochlorine pesticides. Mean concentrations ranged from 7.9-52.0 microg/kg and maximum residue limits (MRLs) of some pesticides were exceeded in up to 7% of samples. The estimated total diet intakes (ETDIs) for aldrin and dieldrin exceeded their maximum permissible intakes. It is concluded that residues of organochlorine pesticides are present in maize in Lagos markets. Some exceed safety levels with possible adverse effects on human health.

The safety of consumption of the products tested was also assessed. The contents of As, Cd and Pb were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). To measure Hg, an atomic absorption spectrometry method (AAS) with the amalgamation technique was applied. To assess the level of consumption of the tested products, an online survey was conducted. To estimate health risk, three indicators were used: the target hazard quotient (THQ), cancer risk (CR) and hazard index (HI). The research material obtained 242 different samples without replications. The highest average content of As, Cd, Pb and Hg were observed for the following groups of products: oat (10.19 µg/kg), buckwheat (48.35 µg/kg), millet (74.52 µg/kg) and buckwheat (1.37 µg/kg), respectively. For six samples, exceedance of established limits was found-three in the case of Cd and three of Pb. Due to the lack of established limits, As and Hg content of the tested products was not compared.

Results of the study indicated that, concentrations of protein, fat, ash, Ca, Fe, Zn and Cu were significantly (p <or= 0.05) increased when plain corn and sorghum gruels were enriched with SUA-90 beans, peanut paste and/or ground sardines. Soaking and germinating the SUA-90 beans and dehulling the sorghum reduced the concentration of tannins in the gruels significantly (p <or= 0.05). The corn and sorghum-based composite gruels had short shelf lives when stored under ambient temperatures (28.6C) ranging between four and six hours, with gruels containing ground sardines showing a tendency to spoil faster. All composite products except those containing germinated SUA-90 beans were liked and highly accepted by consumers (p <or= 0.05) similar to the traditional plain corn and sorghum gruels.

Rice is an important staple food consumed widely and consists of a major part of the diets for half of the world population. Human exposure to these mycotoxins is a serious problem especially in developing countries where hot and humid climates favor the fungal growth and where food storage conditions are poor and lack of regulatory limits enforcement. The recent developments of biomarkers have provided opportunities in assessing aflatoxins exposure and related health effects in the high-risk population groups. This review describes the worldwide occurrence of aflatoxins in rice during the period from 1990 to 2015 and biomarkers-based evidence for human exposure to aflatoxins and their adverse health effects. Aflatoxin is a potent hepatocarcinogen and humans may expose to it at any stage of life. Epidemiological studies reported an association between aflatoxin intake and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in some sub-Saharan and Asian countries. Even daily high intake of rice with a low level of contamination is of health concern. Thus, it is necessary to implement effective strategies to prevent contamination and fungal growth in rice. A good agricultural and manufacturing practice should be applied during handling, storage and distribution of rice to ensure that aflatoxins contamination level is lower in the final product. Moreover, a regular survey for aflatoxins occurrence in rice and biomarkers-based studies is recommended to prevent and reduce the adverse health effects in the world population."

Overall, none of the Italian samples and only one organic baby food sample from a Spanish market was above the maximum permitted levels established by European legislation. Fumonisins were found mostly in corn flour followed by cookies and cornflakes. Eleven samples from Spain and nine samples from Italy were organic products, being contaminated the 72% and 77% of the samples, respectively. Analysis of the results showed that levels of fumonisins in corn products were similar in Italy and Spain. The safety of fumonisin intake through corn products was demonstrated by the calculation of the estimated daily intake of both populations considering organic and conventional products separately, which ranged from 1.7 × 10(-3) to 0.72 µg kg(-1) bw day(-1) and comparing them with the provisional maximum total daily intake (PMTDI) of 2 µg kg(-1) bw day(-1) established by the European Union."

The effects of Bt maize on F. tenuicornis were assessed by measuring life-table parameters when reared on Bt and non-Bt maize. The content of Cry1Ab toxin in different stages of F. tenuicornis reared on Bt maize and the persistence of the toxin in adults where determined in order to evaluate the possible exposure of predators when feeding on thrips. In addition, Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) was used as a model predator to assess how the behaviour of prey and predator may influence the exposure of a natural enemy to the Bt toxin. Life-table parameter results showed that F. tenuicornis was not affected when it was reared on Bt maize. This indicates that the potential for prey quality-mediated effects on predators is low. Bt content was highest in thrips larvae and adults, and negligible in the non-feeding prepupal and pupal stages. The persistence of the Cry1Ab toxin in adult F. tenuicornis was short, resulting in a decrease of 97% within the first 24 h. Predation success by young C. carnea larvae varied among the thrips stages, indicating that exposure of predators to Bt toxin can additionally depend on the prey stage. When combining the current knowledge of the susceptibility of major thrips predators with our findings showing no potential for prey quality-mediated effects, relatively low toxin content in thrips as well as short persistence, it can be concluded that the risks for predators when feeding on thrips in or next to Bt maize fields are negligible."

Although high incidences of positive aflatoxins samples have widely been detected, few samples were detected as exceeding the national's maximum residue limit (10 μg/kg). Limited information is available on risk assessment of human health hazards of mycotoxins in rice, children should be paid more attention to due to their having the highest mycotoxins exposure level, although the risks are generally at low levels from rice. Mycotoxins are mainly distributed in the outer layer of the paddy rice (also called rough rice, referring to whole rice grain with the hulls), and the AFB1 content in bran is 8.4 times greater than that in brown rice (hulled rice). Further investigation should focus on isolation and identification of mycotoxins-producing fungal strains, especially unknown mycotoxigenic fungal strains determination. Infection resistant rice breeding of mycotoxigenic fungal species may be a fundamental approach to guaranteeing rice safety in China."

The toxins frequently co-occur in maize. Where these commodities are dietary staples, for example, in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, the contamination translates to high-level chronic exposure. This is particularly true in subsistence farming communities where regulations to control exposure are either non-existent or practically unenforceable. Aflatoxins are hepatocarcinogenic in humans, particularly in conjunction with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, and cause aflatoxicosis in episodic poisoning outbreaks. In animals, these toxins also impair growth and are immunosuppressive; the latter effects are of increasing interest in human populations. FB have been reported to induce liver and kidney tumours in rodents and are classified as Group 2B 'possibly carcinogenic to humans', with ecological studies implying a possible link to increased oesophageal cancer. Recent studies also suggest that the FB may cause neural tube defects in some maize-consuming populations. There is a plausible mechanism for this effect via a disruption of ceramide synthase and sphingolipid biosynthesis. Notwithstanding the need for a better evidence-base on mycotoxins and human health, supported by better biomarkers of exposure and effect in epidemiological studies, the existing data are sufficient to prioritize exposure reduction in vulnerable populations. For both toxins, there are a number of practical primary and secondary prevention strategies which could be beneficial if the political will and financial investment can be applied to what remains a largely and rather shamefully ignored global health issue."

Differences between the two regions were analyzed using the Chi-square test, Fisher exact test, and two-sample t-test. The median quantity of maize harvested by farmers in the two regions after shelling was 585 kg. A median of 20 kg of maize was put aside as a result of rotting before shelling, and there was a significant mean difference in maize set aside as a result of rotting between the two regions (107.88 kg vs. 31.96 kg; t (306.25) = 5.707, P value <0.001).

Various parameters including mortality, development time, oviposition rate were measured. Spider mites were used as a prey for N. cucumeris, since these herbivores are known to contain similar levels of Cry1Ab toxin, when reared on Bt maize, as those found in the transgenic leaf material. In contrast, toxin levels in pollen of this transgenic cultivar are very low.

Pollen was shown to be a less suitable food source for this predator as compared to spider mites. Moreover, subtle effects on female N. cucumeris (9% longer development time and 17% reduced fecundity) were measured when fed with pollen originating from Bt maize as compared to non-Bt maize pollen. Our findings indicate that the predatory mite N. cucumeris is not sensitive to the Cry1Ab toxin as no effects could be detected when offered Bt-containing spider mites, and that the effects found when fed with Bt maize pollen can be assigned to differences in nutritional quality of Bt and non-Bt maize pollen.

Because OPEs are normally present alongside heavy metals in soils, the effects of interactions between OPEs and heavy metals on plant uptake of OPEs need to be determined. In this study, we investigated the effects of OPEs chemical structure, plant cultivar and copper (Cu) on the uptake and translocation of OPEs by plants. The bioaccumulation of OPEs varied among plant cultivars. They were preferentially enriched in carrot, with the lowest concentrations observed in maize. OPEs with electron-ring substituents (ER-OPEs) exhibited a higher potential for root uptake than did OPEs with open-chain substituents (OC-OPEs), which could be attributed to the higher sorption of ER-OPEs onto root charged surfaces. This was explained by the stronger noncovalent interactions with the electron-rich structure of ER-OPEs. The presence of Cu slightly reduced the distinct difference in the ability of roots to take up OC-OPEs and ER-OPEs. This was explained by the interactions of Cu ions with the electron-rich structure of ER-OPEs, which suppressed the sorption of ER-OPEs on the root surface. A negative relationship between the logarithms of the translocation factor and octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) was observed in treatments with either OPEs only or OPEs + Cu, implying the significant role of hydrophobicity in the OPEs acropetal translocation. The results will improve our understanding of the uptake and translocation of OPEs by plant cultivars as well as how the process is affected by the chemical structure of OPEs and Cu, leading to improvements in the ecological risk assessment of OPEs in the food chain."

A low-cost sorter prototype (the 'DropSort' device) that separated maize grain based on KBD and HKW was more effective in reducing FUM than AF. We then evaluated the effectiveness of DropSorting when combined with either size or visual sorting. Size sorting followed by DropSorting was the fastest method for reducing FUM to under 2 ppm, but was not effective in reducing AF levels in maize grain to under 20 ppb, especially for heavily AF-contaminated grain. Analysis of individual kernels showed that high -AF maize kernels had lower weight, volume, density, length, and width and higher sphericity than those with low AF. Single kernel weight was the most significant predictor of AF concentration. The DropSort excluded kernels with lower single kernel weight, volume, width, depth, and sphericity. We also found that visual sorting and bright greenish-yellow fluorescence sorting of maize single kernels were successful in separating kernels based on AF levels.

In the indirect bioassay, parasitism rate, cocoon weight and the number of M. cingulum progeny produced per host were significantly reduced when M. cingulum-parasitized Cry1Ac-susceptible Ostrinia furnacalis were fed a diet containing purified Cry1Ac; however, life-table parameters of M. cingulum were not adversely affected when the same assay was performed with Cry1Ac-resistant O. furnacalis. These results indicated that the detrimental effects detected with a Cry1Ac-susceptible host were mediated by poor host quality. In a direct bioassay, no difference in life-table parameters were detected when M. cingulum adults were directly fed a 20% honey solution with or without Cry1Ac; however, survival and longevity were significantly reduced when M. cingulum adults were fed a honey solution containing potassium arsenate, which was used as a positive control. The stability and bioactivity of Cry1Ac toxin in the food sources and Cry1Ac toxin uptake by the host insect and parasitoid were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and sensitive-insect bioassays. Our results demonstrate that M. cingulum is not sensitive to Cry1Ac toxin at concentrations exceeding those encountered in Bacillus thuringiensis maize fields. This study also demonstrates the power of using resistant hosts when assessing the risk of genetically modified plants on non-target organisms and will be useful for assessing other non-target impacts."

Most DBP toxicity studies have focused on high supraphysiological exposure levels; thus, very little is known about exposures occurring at environmentally relevant levels. CD-1 female mice (80 days old) were treated with tocopherol-stripped corn oil (vehicle control) or DBP dissolved in oil at environmentally relevant (10 and 100 μg/kg/day) or higher (1000 μg/kg/day) levels for 30 days to evaluate effects on DNA damage response (DDR) pathway genes and folliculogenesis. DBP exposure caused dose-dependent effects on folliculogenesis and gene expression. Specifically, animals exposed to the high dose of DBP had more atretic follicles in their ovaries, while in those treated with environmentally relevant doses, follicle numbers were no different from vehicle-treated controls. DBP exposure significantly reduced the expression of DDR genes including those involved in homologous recombination (Atm, Brca1, Mre11a, Rad50), mismatch repair (Msh3, Msh6), and nucleotide excision repair (Xpc, Pcna) in a dose-specific manner. Interestingly, staining for the DNA damage marker, γH2AX, was similar between treatments. DBP exposure did not result in differential DNA methylation in the Brca1 promoter but significantly reduced transcript levels for the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt1, in the ovary. Collectively, these findings show that oral exposure to environmentally relevant levels of DBP for 30 days does not significantly impact folliculogenesis in adult mice but leads to aberrant ovarian expression of DDR genes."

Grab samples were collected under baseflow and runoff conditions at 21 hydrologic monitoring stations between April 15 and July 15 from 1996 to 1999.

Estimates of herbicide load and relative losses were computed for each watershed. Median parent herbicide losses, as a percentage of applied, ranged from 0.33 to 3.9%; loss rates that were considerably higher than other areas of the United States. Watershed vulnerability to herbicide transport, measured as herbicide load per treated area, showed that the runoff potential of soils was a critical factor affecting herbicide transport. Herbicide transport from these watersheds contributed a disproportionately high amount of the herbicide load to both the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. Based on these results, this region of the Corn Belt is highly vulnerable to transport of herbicides from fields to streams, and it should be targeted for implementation of management practices designed to reduce herbicide losses in surface runoff."

On the one hand, dairy production constitutes an important part of the human diet, but it is also responsible for significant emissions of potent greenhouse gases and other pollutants. In this study, the environmental aspects of pasteurized milk production in Iran were investigated using a life-cycle approach. Three sub-systems, namely feed production, dairy farm and dairy factory, were taken into account to determine how and where Iranian pasteurized milk production might be made more environmentally friendly and energy efficient. The results clearly demonstrate that the feed production stage was the hot spot in pasteurized milk production in terms of energy consumption, environmental burdens and economic costs. The largest share of the total production costs belonged to animal feeds (43%), which were part of the feed production stage. The largest consumers of energy in the production of raw milk were alfalfa (30.3%), concentrate (24%), straw (17.8%) and maize (10.9%) for cows, followed by diesel fuel (6.6%) and electricity (5.6%). The global warming potential for the production of 1000kg of raw milk at the dairy-farm gate was estimated at 457kg CO2,eq.

The four selected PAHs achieved equilibrium between the air and the two living crop leaf surfaces over the 15-day monitoring period. Inter-species and inter-chemical variability existed in terms of the time required to achieve equilibrium, mass transfer coefficients (kAL) and the equilibrated adsorption capacity (EAC), which was mainly attributed to the different lg KOA values among the four PAHs and the variable leaf-wax content between the soybean and corn species. Compared with when the PAHs existed singly, the time required to achieve adsorption equilibrium was longer while the EAC was reduced for each of the four PAHs in a mixture, which was attributed to competitive adsorption among the coexisting components. These findings prove that the novel analytical method provides a novel platform for the in situ characterization of the environmental behaviors of multiple PAHs, with their spectra overlapping, between the air and plant skin. The coexistence of multiple PAHs in the air inhibits their individual uptake capacity by crop leaf skin, but increases the total adsorption of PAHs, potentially reducing crop security and increasing human health risk via the terrestrial food web."

Exposure to common foodborne toxins is associated with diverse conditions such as cancer, immunotoxicity, growth impairment, and neurological deficits. Interventions focused solely on reducing toxin levels have proven difficult to sustain. Using case studies of two foodborne toxins, aflatoxin and cassava cyanide, this article addresses the heightened risk of particular diseases from eating monotonous diets based in maize, groundnuts, and cassava: common in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. We also discuss the potential role of increased dietary diversity in counteracting these diseases. Increased dietary diversity can reduce consumption of toxins and increase intake of nutrients that could counteract the toxicity of such chemicals. In Qidong, China, a population that previously consumed a monotonous maize-based diet and increased dietary diversity since the 1980s has experienced a dramatic reduction in liver cancer mortalities. That liver cancer decreased as dietary diversity increased is the catalyst for the hypothesis that dietary diversity could have a direct impact on reducing health effects of foodborne toxins. Future research, agricultural development, and food policy reforms should take into consideration the multifaceted benefits associated with improved dietary diversity.

In doing so, many have discovered that the direct impacts of their owned operations are dwarfed by those upstream in the supply chain, requiring transparency and knowledge about environmental impacts along the supply chains. Life cycle assessments (LCAs) have been used to identify hotspots of environmental impacts at national levels, yet these provide little subnational information necessary for guiding firms' specific supply networks. In this paper, our Food System Supply-Chain Sustainability (FoodS3) model connects spatial, firm-specific demand of corn purchasers with upstream corn production in the United States through a cost minimization transport model. This provides a means to link county-level corn production in the United States to firm-specific demand locations associated with downstream processing facilities. Our model substantially improves current LCA assessment efforts that are confined to broad national or state level impacts.

The clover cover crop and wheat-fallow increased inorganic N in both nutrient managements.

Afngg1 gene deletion markedly decreased lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation modification of histones H4K5 and H4K8 compared with the control strain. Additionally, Afngg1 deletion inhibited mycelial growth of A. flavus, and the number of conidia and hydrophobicity were significantly decreased.

Furthermore, the pathogenicity of the ΔAfngg1 strain infecting peanut and corn grains was also diminished, including reduced spore production and aflatoxin biosynthesis compared with A. flavus control and Afngg1 complementation strains.

A small amount of virginiamycin residue was found in 24 corn DDGS, 1 corn wet distillers grain with solubles, and 2 sorghum DDGS samples out of 242 samples in total. One sorghum DDGS sample out of 168 DG samples was contaminated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, but the transmission route of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy agent could not be clearly defined. The concentrations of aflatoxin and fumonisin DG by-products averaged 3.4 μg/kg and 0.7 mg/kg, respectively. Among contaminated corn DG samples, five DDGS samples for aflatoxin contained a higher concentration than the U. S.

Ecological risk is operationally defined as a function of exposure and adverse effects. Information on the environmental fate of RNA-based plant-incorporated protectants is essential to define routes and duration of exposure to potentially sensitive nontarget organisms. Providing these details in problem formulation helps focus the ecological risk assessment on the relevant species of concern. Postharvest plant residue is often considered to be the most significant route of exposure for genetically modified crops to adjacent aquatic environments. Previous studies have shown that DvSnf7 RNA from SmartStax PRO maize dissipates rapidly in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Although these studies suggest that direct exposure to DvSnf7 RNA is likely to be low, little is known regarding the fate of DvSnf7 RNA produced in plants after entering an aquatic environment. This exposure scenario is relevant to detritivorous aquatic invertebrates that process conditioned maize tissues that enter aquatic environments. To assess potential exposure to shredders, dissipation of DvSnf7 RNA expressed maize tissue was evaluated following immersion in microcosms containing sediment and water. Concentrations of DvSnf7 RNA in the tissue were measured over a duration of 21 d. The DvSnf7 RNA dissipated rapidly from immersed maize tissue and was undetectable in the tissues after 3 d. Concentrations of DvSnf7 RNA found in tissue as well as calculated water column concentrations were below levels known to elicit effects in a highly sensitive surrogate species, supporting the conclusion of minimal risk to aquatic nontarget organisms.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances persist in treated wastewater and are inadvertently introduced into the environment when treated wastewater is reused as an irrigation source. The Pennsylvania State University (PSU) has been spray-irrigating its wastewater at a 2.45 km2 mixed-use agricultural and forested site known as the ""Living Filter"" since the 1960s. To understand the spatiotemporal patterns of 20 PFAS at the Living Filter, water samples were collected bimonthly from fall 2019 through winter 2021 from the PSU's wastewater effluent and from each of the site's 13 monitoring wells. Crop tissue was collected at the time of harvest to assess PFAS presence in corn silage and tall fescue grown at the study site. Total measured PFAS concentrations in the monitoring wells ranged from nondectable to 155 ng L-1 , with concentrations increasing with the direction of groundwater flow. Concentrations within each well exhibited little temporal variability across sampling events, with mixed relationships between PFAS and groundwater elevation observed between wells. Further, >84% of the PFAS present in livestock feed crops were short-chain compounds, with PFAS consumed annually by livestock fed crops harvested from the site estimated to be 2.46-7.67 mg animal-1 yr-1.

It is making use of 65-nm gold nanorods (AuNRs), 20-nm upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), fluorescence dyes, and DNA sequences. In the absence of ZEN and FB1, the UCNPs and AuNRs associate through DNA sequences. Due to IFE effect, weak fluorescence signals are collected. In the presence of ZEN or FB1, UCNPs and AuNRs become unstable and partially separate from each other. This results in the recovery of fluorescence signals.

Agricultural biotechnology offers the promise to produce crops with improved agronomic characteristics (eg, insect resistance, herbicide tolerance, disease resistance, and climatic tolerance) and enhanced consumer benefits (eg, better taste and texture, longer shelf life, and more nutritious). Certainly, the products of agricultural biotechnology should be subjected to a careful and complete safety assessment before commercialization. Because the genetic modification ultimately results in the introduction of new proteins into the food plant, the safety, including the potential allergenicity, of the newly introduced proteins must be assessed. Although most allergens are proteins, only a few of the many proteins found in foods are allergenic under the typical circumstances of exposure. The potential allergenicity of the introduced proteins can be evaluated by focusing on the source of the gene, the sequence homology of the newly introduced protein to known allergens, the expression level of the novel protein in the modified crop, the functional classification of the novel protein, the reactivity of the novel protein with IgE from the serum of individuals with known allergies to the source of the transferred genetic material, and various physicochemical properties of the newly introduced protein, such as heat stability and digestive stability. Few products of agricultural biotechnology (and none of the current products) will involve the transfer of genes from known allergenic sources.

Schmidt et al. , Arch Environ Contam Toxicol 56:221-228 (2009) recently reported that Cry1Ab and Cry3Bb were toxic to larvae of Adalia bipunctata in direct feeding studies. This study was quoted, among others, to justify the ban of Bt maize (MON 810) in Germany. The study has subsequently been criticized because of methodological shortcomings that make it questionable whether the observed effects were due to direct toxicity of the two Cry proteins. We therefore conducted tritrophic studies assessing whether an effect of the two proteins on A. bipunctata could be detected under more realistic routes of exposure. Spider mites that had fed on Bt maize (events MON810 and MON88017) were used as carriers to expose young A. bipunctata larvae to high doses of biologically active Cry1Ab and Cry3Bb1. Ingestion of the two Cry proteins by A. bipunctata did not affect larval mortality, weight, or development time. These results were confirmed in a subsequent experiment in which A. bipunctata were directly fed with a sucrose solution containing dissolved purified proteins at concentrations approximately 10 times higher than measured in Bt maize-fed spider mites. Hence, our study does not provide any evidence that larvae of A. bipunctata are sensitive to Cry1Ab and Cry3Bb1 or that Bt maize expressing these proteins would adversely affect this predator. The results suggest that the apparent harmful effects of Cry1Ab and Cry3Bb1 reported by Schmidt et al. , Arch Environ Contam Toxicol 56:221-228 (2009) were artifacts of poor study design and procedures. It is thus important that decision-makers evaluate the quality of individual scientific studies and do not view all as equally rigorous and relevant."

It exists in several oxidation states. In soil, depending on its oxidation-reduction potential, it can occur in bivalent, trivalent or hexavalent forms. Hexavalent chromium compounds are cancerogenic to humans. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Cr(VI) on the structure of bacteria and fungi in soil, to find out how this effect is modified by humic acids and to determine the response of Zea mays to this form of chromium. A pot experiment was conducted to answer the above questions. Zea mays was sown in natural soil and soil polluted with Cr(VI) in an amount of 60 mg kg-1 d. m. Both soils were treated with humic acids in the form of HumiAgra preparation. The ecophysiological and genetic diversity of bacteria and fungi was assayed in soil under maize (not sown with Zea mays). In addition, the following were determined: yield of maize, greenness index, index of tolerance to chromium, translocation index and accumulation of chromium in the plant. It has been determined that Cr(VI) significantly distorts the growth and development of Zea mays, while humic acids completely neutralize its toxic effect on the plant. This element had an adverse effect on the development of bacteria of the genera Cellulosimicrobium, Kaistobacter, Rhodanobacter, Rhodoplanes and Nocardioides and fungi of the genera Chaetomium and Humicola. Soil contamination with Cr(VI) significantly diminished the genetic diversity and richness of bacteria and the ecophysiological diversity of fungi. The negative impact of Cr(VI) on the diversity of bacteria and fungi was mollified by Zea mays and the application of humic acids."

Teff is gluten-free in nature, has high iron and fiber content, and many other health benefits make this crop interesting to many consumers. Since no insect pests are attacking the teff grains, farmers do not apply pesticides on it, unlike maize and other grains. Nevertheless, residues of organochlorine pesticides have been detected at an alarming level that could pose a consumer risk. Teff is often consumed as injera which is a fermented flat pancake. The main aim of the present study is, therefore, to investigate the effect of household food processing (doughing and baking) on the reduction of pesticide residues from teff. Pesticide residues previously detected in teff grain such as permethrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos ethyl, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDT, and p,p'-DDT were spiked and extracted followed by the subsequent household processing which are generally doughing (dough making followed by fermentation) and baking. From the findings of this study, doughing decrease the pesticide residues in the range of 59.9-86.4% and baking in the range of 63.2-90.2%. Kruskal-Wallis analysis indicates that the reduction of pesticide residues by baking is significantly different from doughing (p-value < 0.0001). There is also a significant difference between non-fermented and fermented dough (p-value = 0.012). The processing factor for doughing and baking was less than one (PF < 1 = reduction factor) which indicates the reduction of pesticides due to teff processing. The cumulative effect of these processing methods is important to evaluate the risks associated with the ingestion of pesticides, particularly in teff grain."

One of the main concerns of this application of biochar is its potential contamination with heavy metals (HMs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The aim of this research was to access the environmental risk of biochar used as a soil amendment on soil mesofauna (mites and springtails). We conducted both field and laboratory experiments with the use of wood-chip biochar from low-temperature (300 °C) flash pyrolysis. Biochar was free from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and the concentration of all tested toxic compounds was very low or even under the level of detection. Both the results of field and laboratory studies show no toxic effects on soil mesofauna. In the field studies, the biochar application of 50 t/ha in maize and oilseed rape crops significantly increased the mean number of mesofauna. This change probably resulted from improved soil chemical properties (in particular organic carbon content and cation exchange capacity) upon biochar addition. The results of the avoidance test with the use of springtail species Folsomia candida showed the possible short-term toxicity risk from a dose of 5%. The results of the reproduction test indicate the negative response of F. candida from the rate of 25% (higher than the field dose, which corresponds to 10% in laboratory tests). The reason for the short-term toxicity might be the considerable increase in soil pH after biochar addition. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has looked so widely into the effect of biochar on soil mesofauna. We encourage further studies into the risk assessment of biochar on soil organisms in both a controlled laboratory environment and in the open field."

Negative impact of O3 on some common crops such as wheat and soybeans has been widely recognized, but there is relatively little information about maize, the typical C4 plant and third most important crop worldwide. To partly compensate this knowledge gap, the maize cultivar (Zhengdan 958, ZD958) with maximum planting area in China was exposed to a range of chronic ozone (O3) exposures in open top chambers (OTCs). The O3 effects on this highly important crop were estimated in relation to two O3 metrics, AOT40 (accumulated hourly O3 concentration over a threshold of 40 ppb during daylight hours) and POD6 (Phytotoxic O3 Dose above a threshold flux of 6 nmol O3 m-2 s-1 during a specified period). We found that (1) the reduced light-saturated net photosynthetic rate (Asat) mainly caused by non-stomatal limitations across heading and grain filling stages, but the stomatal limitations at the former stage were stronger than those at the latter stage; (2) impact of O3 on water use efficiency (WUE) of maize was significantly dependent on developmental stage; (3) yield loss induced by O3 was mainly due to a reduction in kernels weight rather than in the number of kernels; (4) the performance of AOT40 and POD6 was similar, according to their determination coefficients (R2); (5) the order of O3 sensitivity among different parameters was photosynthetic parameters > biomass parameters > yield-related parameters; (6) Responses of Asat to O3 between heading and gran filling stages were significantly different based on AOT40 metric, but not POD6.

At baseline home-grown maize, maize-based porridge, and first-void urine samples were collected from female participants (n=22), following their traditional food practices in Centane, South Africa. During intervention the participants were trained to recognize and remove visibly infected kernels, and to wash the remaining kernels. Participants consumed the porridge prepared from the sorted and washed maize on each day of the two-day intervention. Porridge, maize, and urine samples were collected for FB1 analyses. The geometric mean (95% confidence interval) for FB1 exposure based on porridge (dry weight) consumption at baseline and following intervention was 4.84 (2.87-8.14) and 1.87 (1.40-2.51) μg FB1/kg body weight/day, respectively, (62% reduction, P<0.05).

To assess parent and alkylated PAHs accumulation accurately, the uptake of individual 7-isopropyl-1-methylphenanthrene (Retene), 3-methyl-phenanthrene (3-MP) and phenanthrene (Phe) by living maize, soybean and potato leaf surfaces, as well as the effects of cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTMAB) and anionic sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS), were examined in situ using fiber-optic fluorimetry. For each of three PAH chemicals, the uptake achieved equilibrium between the air and living crop leaf surfaces within the 120-h monitoring period. There is inter-chemical and inter-species variability in terms of both the time required reaching equilibrium, the equilibrated adsorption concentration (EAC) and the overall air-surfaces mass transfer coefficient (kAS). The EAC of the three PAHs for each of the three crops' leaf surfaces increased with the number of alkyl substitutions on the aromatic ring. For any given PAHs, the EAC values followed the sequence of potato > soybean > maize, which was dominantly controlled by their leaf surface polarity index ((O+N)/C). The presence of CTMAB and SDBS increased the EAC of PAHs in the three crops' leaf surfaces by 6.5-17.1%, due to the plasticizing effect induced by the surface-sorbed surfactants, and the enhancement degree was closely associated with leaf-wax content and lg KOW values of PAHs. In addition, the two surfactants promoted the kAS values of the three chemicals by 7.7-23.3%. These results demonstrated that surfactants promoted the uptake of PAHs onto the crop leaf surfaces, potentially threatening the agricultural product safety."

Epidemiological evidence suggests a relationship between the Fusarium load in corn, exposure to fumonisins, and esophageal cancer. However, mechanisms of actions of fumonisins are not yet fully resolved and epidemiological studies suffer from various confounding factors. Correspondingly, the most relevant congener of the fumonisin family (fumonisin B1 ) has been classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans and maximum limits have been set for corn and corn-based products. However, many non-corn-based products are also susceptible to fumonisin contamination. Indeed, some of them contain very high amounts of fumonisins, but enter the market legally. Furthermore, fumonisin exposure of consumers is probably consistently being underestimated because only a fraction of fumonisins can be detected by routine analysis. The bioavailability and toxicity of most nondetectable (cryptic) forms has not been resolved. In this work, we review the developments of cancer research into fumonisins since their discovery in 1988 until today and provide an overview of the contributions of various foodstuffs to fumonisin exposure, including those products that have been largely neglected in the past. In conclusion, (1) corn remains the principal source of fumonisin ingestion, but fumonisins in non-corn-based commodities require continuous monitoring; (2) cryptic fumonisins should be included in risk assessment studies; and (3) certain population groups (for example children) may suffer from enhanced exposure and could face increased health risks."

Contamination of crops at levels of 20 ng g(-1) or higher (as regulated by the USFDA) by this toxin and potent carcinogen makes the crop unsalable, resulting in a significant economic burden on the producer. This review focuses on elimination of this contamination in corn which is a major US crop and the basis of many products. Corn is also ""nature's example"" of a crop containing heritable resistance to aflatoxin contamination, thereby serving as a model for achieving resistance to aflatoxin contamination in other crops as well. This crop is the largest production grain crop worldwide, providing food for billions of people and livestock and critical feedstock for production of biofuels. In 2011, the economic value of the US corn crop was US$76 billion, with US growers producing an estimated 12 billion bushels, more than one-third of the world's supply. Thus, the economics and significance of corn as a food crop and the threat to food safety due to aflatoxin contamination of this major food crop have prompted the many research efforts in many parts of the world to identify resistance in corn to aflatoxin contamination. Plant breeding and varietal selection has been used as a tool to develop varieties resistance to disease. This methodology has been employed in defining a few corn lines that show resistance to A. flavus invasion; however, no commercial lines have been marketed. With the new tools of proteomics and genomics, identification of resistance mechanisms, and rapid resistance marker selection methodologies, there is an increasing possibility of finding significant resistance in corn, and in understanding the mechanism of this resistance."

Resistance and toxin data of the hybrids are mostly not given, so farmers are not informed about the food safety risks of their grown hybrids. According to the findings aflatoxin regularly occurs at preharvest in Hungary and possibly other countries in the region can be jeopardized. We tested, with an improved methodology (two isolates, three pathogens, and a toxin control), 18 commercial hybrids (2017-2020) for kernel resistance (%), and for toxin contamination separately by two-two isolates of F. graminearum, F. verticillioides (mg/kg), and A. flavus (μg/kg). The preharvest toxin contamination was measured in the controls. Highly significant kernel resistance and toxin content differences were identified between hybrids to the different fungi. Extreme high toxin production was found for each toxic species. Only about 10-15% of the hybrids showed higher resistance to the fungal species tested and lower contamination level of their toxins. The lacking correlations between resistance to different fungi and toxins suggest that resistance to different fungi and response to toxin contamination inherits independently, so a toxin analysis is necessary. For safety risk estimation, separated artificial and natural kernel infection and toxin data are needed against all pathogens. Higher resistance to A. flavus and F. verticillioides stabilizes or improves feed safety in hot and dry summers, balancing the harmful effect of climate changes. Resistance and toxin tests during variety registration is an utmost necessity. The exclusion of susceptible or highly susceptible hybrids from commercial production results in reduced toxin contamination."

Aspergillus section Flavi species like A. flavus and A. parasiticus produce aflatoxins, while section Circumdati species like A. ochraceus and A. sclerotiorum produce ochratoxin A. Mitigating these toxins in food and feed is a critical and ongoing worldwide effort. We have previously investigated biosynthetic gene clusters in Aspergillus flavus that are linked to fungal virulence in corn. We found that one such cluster, asa, is responsible for the production of aspergillic acid, an iron-binding, hydroxamic acid-containing pyrazinone metabolite. Furthermore, we found that the asa gene cluster is present in many other aflatoxin- and ochratoxin-producing aspergilli. The core gene in the asa cluster encodes the small nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like (NRPS-like) protein AsaC. We have swapped the asaC ortholog from A. sclerotiorum into A. flavus, replacing its native copy, and have also cloned both asaC orthologs into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that AsaC orthologs in section Flavi and section Circumdati, while only containing adenylation-thiolation-reductase (ATR) domains, can selectively biosynthesize distinct pyrazinone natural products: deoxyaspergillic acid and flavacol, respectively. Because pyrazinone natural products and the gene clusters responsible for their production are implicated in a variety of important microbe-host interactions, uncovering the function and selectivity of the enzymes involved could lead to strategies that ultimately benefit human health."

The use of treated wastewater in irrigation systems improves soil health and enhances crop growth and productivity. However, it has been characterized as a source of heavy metals. The unknown is how heavy metals' movements would be impacted under an intercropping system when irrigated with treated wastewater. Understanding the dynamic of heavy metals in soil-plant systems is essential for environmental risk assessment and sustainable agriculture. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to explore the effects of treated wastewater irrigation on plant growth, soil chemical properties, and the movements of Zn, Cu, Pb, and Cd from soil to plants in monoculture and intercropping systems. Maize and soybean were selected as the test crops and groundwater and treated livestock wastewater as the water sources. This study found that treated wastewater irrigation and intercropping systems synergically increased the soil nutrient content and crop growth. The concentrations of Zn, Pb, and Cd were significantly higher in leaves compared to other plant parts contrastingly to Cu, which was higher in roots. In addition, treated wastewater irrigation increased grain nutrient content in mono- and intercropping systems while the concentration of heavy metals was in the acceptable range for human consumption. The enrichment degree of Cu and Pb due to treated livestock wastewater irrigation relative to groundwater irrigation was higher in uncultivated soil compared with cultivated soil. This study showed that the intercropping system facilitated heavy metals' transfer from soil to plant except for Cd. These findings provide guidelines for a safe utilization of treated wastewater in agricultural systems and to reduce freshwater use pressure."

A sensitive and specific method for detecting Bt proteins in GM crops is of great significance for environment and food risk assessment. In this study, using Cry1Ab as a model Bt protein, an ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for Cry1Ab protein has been developed based on phage displayed peptide. Phage displayed peptides against Cry1Ab protein were obtained from a phage displayed peptide library without animal immunization process through biopanning-elution strategy. After modification of electrode with gold nanoparticles, selected phage displayed peptide was applied to electrochemical immunosensor for Cry1Ab. Under the optimized conditions, the peptide-based immunosensor showed a dynamic range of 0.01-100ng/mL and a limit detection of 7pg/mL. Specific measurement of this established method was conducted by testing cross-reactivity of Cry1Ac (88% amino acid sequence homology to Cry1Ab protein), and the result showed that peptide-based immunosensor has negligible cross-reactivity with analogue. In addition, the accuracy and reproducibility of this established immunosensor was evaluated by testing the recovery of spiked samples and assay coefficients of variation, respectively. The results showed that the average recovery of corn and wheat sample was 90-120% and 86.7-120%, respectively; the intra-assay coefficient of variation was 7.4% (n = 6), and the inter-assay coefficient of variation was 6.9% (n = 6) at 1ng/mL Cry1Ab solution. Furthermore, the novel concept of peptide-based immunosensor may provide a potential application in general method for the ultrasensitive detection of various Bt proteins."

Therefore, it is of interest to reduce the contamination of crops by aflatoxins in the field and post-harvest. Among the current technologies being developed is the deployment of non-aflatoxigenic strains of Aspergillus species to competitively exclude aflatoxigenic conspecifics from crops in the field thereby curtailing aflatoxin production by the former. The success in this endeavor makes the non-aflatoxigenic fungi good candidates for biological control programs. However, the current techniques for segregating non-aflatoxigenic from aflatoxigenic fungi suffer two main drawbacks: they are based on morphological and chemical tests with a combination of visual color changes detected in a culture plate which suffer some degree of inaccuracy. Secondly, the existing methods are incapable of accurately quantifying aflatoxin production by fungi in culture. We developed a culture system for inducing aflatoxin production by Aspergillus using maize kernels as growth substrate followed by quantification using ELISA. The method was compared to the Dichlorvos-Ammonia (DV-AM) method for determining aflatoxigenicity. Our findings encapsulate a method more robust than the currently used DV-AM approach because, for the first time, we are able to assess aflatoxigenicity and aflatoxigenic variability among Aspergillus species earlier classified as non-aflatoxigenic by the DV-AM method. Furthermore, the new method presents an opportunity to attribute toxin production by actively growing fungal cultures.

Phytoremediation of cadmium pollution is an environmentally friendly and inexpensive remediation method. In this study, maize (Zea mays L. ) was selected as the phytoremediation crop by a potted method, and the bioavailability of cadmium was investigated by adding exogenous elemental sulfur. The relationships among the sulfur content, maize growth, cadmium accumulation, and soil parameters were systematically studied. The results showed that, with the supplement of sulfur, the soil pH and activities of soil enzymes (urease, catalase, and sucrase) decreased gradually, and the available heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Zn, and Cu) in soil showed an upward trend. The optimal cadmium enrichment was achieved under T2 by increasing both the biomass of the maize plant and the cadmium concentration in roots and stems. However, T3 and T4 significantly inhibited the growth of maize roots and shoots, leading to a much lower plant biomass compared with that of CK (sulfur-free treatment) and T2. In addition, the cumulative cadmium was not increased because of the low accumulation of cadmium in some parts of the plant. Correlation analyses showed that the sulfur content was negatively correlated with soil pH and maize biomass (P < 0.01), and the cadmium content of whole maize was positively correlated with the dry weight of maize (P < 0.05) and the cadmium content in roots and stems (P < 0.01).

The EC20 and EC50 values (the As concentration for 20% or 50% of effect relative to control treatment) based on total As concentration were more variable among different soils than the corresponding EC20 and EC50 values based on extractable (phytoavailable) As concentration. From the studied species, common bean was the most sensitive and maize was the least sensitive to As. Those species were the ones that accumulated the lowest As levels in shoot tissues. Arsenic concentrations measured in plant tissues and estimated bioaccumulation factors were not related to relative As toxicity among species. Data obtained suggest that the current Brazilian prevention value for arsenic is adequate for soils with high arsenic adsorption capacity."

Corn straw-derived biochar pyrolyzed at 300°C (CB300) or bamboo-derived biochar pyrolyzed at 700°C (BB700) was amended into PAH-contaminated soil planted with carrot (Daucus carota L. ). After 150days, 2% CB300 or 2% BB700 amendments significantly reduced the bioaccumulation of PAHs in carrot root (p<0.05), especially for high-molecular-weight PAHs. In the non-rhizosphere, either CB300 or BB700 suppressed PAH dissipation and decreased the bioavailability via adsorption processes. Compared to the control, the total concentration of PAHs in the rhizosphere was higher in the 2% BB700 treatment but the bioavailable concentration was lower. This indicates that BB700 decreased the bioavailability of PAHs primarily via immobilization (adsorption processes). By contrast, the total and bioavailable PAH concentrations were both lower in the 2% CB300 treatment than those in the control. The abundance of bacteria such as Arthrobacter and Flavobacterium and the total number of genes playing important roles in microbial PAH degradation processes increased significantly (p<0.05), which were likely responsible for the rapid dissipation of PAHs in the 2% CB300 treatment in the rhizosphere. These results indicate that CB300 decreased the PAH bioavailability primarily via increasing degradation of PAHs by indigenous microorganisms. The two biochars both showed better effectiveness at reducing the bioavailability of high-molecular-weight PAHs than the low-molecular-weight PAHs in the rhizosphere. Therefore, the mechanisms on how biochar reduces the PAH uptake into carrot are dependent on the type of biochar (e. g. , pyrolysis temperature and feedstock) and root presence."

The maximum biosorption capacity of biochar for 4-bromodiphengl ether was determined to be 50.23 mg/L under an initial concentration of 800 mg/L at pH 7.0 and 40 °C. The data obtained from the biosorption studies were fitted successfully with the pseudo-first-order kinetic and Freundlich isotherm models. The Weber-Morris model analysis indicated that intraparticle diffusion was the limiting step in the biosorption of 4-bromodiphengl ether onto the biosorbent. The values of thermodynamic parameters △G0 were calculated as -24.61 kJ/mol (20 °C), -24.35 kJ/mol (30 °C), and -23.98 kJ/mol (40 °C), △S(0) was -8.45 kJ/mol/K, and △H(0) was 21.36 kJ/mol. The artificial neural network analysis indicated that the initial concentration appeared to be the most influential parameter on the biosorption processes. The removal rate of 4-bromodiphengl ether achieved using the biochar-microorganism system was increased by 63 and 83% compared with the rates obtained with biochar and the strain individually, respectively. The morphology of the biochar and immobilized strain was determined using a scanning electron microscope, and information of the surface functional groups of biochar was obtained through an infrared spectra study."

The feed intake rate (FIR) was estimated experimentally as 4.895 g/day per bird, representing 12.43% of bw.

Based on spill data values available in the literature, it was calculated that, for most crops, a baywing would have to forage an area of field corresponding to less than 60 m2 to obtain the number of seeds required to reach the LD50. It was also shown that this number of seeds is coherent with the amount of seeds ingested in a bout. In a pilot study, all grayish baywings fed with millet seeds treated with 3 g IMI/kg died within three to five days of exposure. In Tier I risk assessment, the trigger value was achieved for all crops except soybean and a weight-of-evidence risk assessment was performed.

The paper performs health-based cost-effectiveness analyses of two potential aflatoxin control strategies in Africa: (1) pre-harvest biocontrol, using atoxigenic strains of Aspergillus flavus competitively to exclude toxigenic strains from colonizing maize in Nigeria; and (2) post-harvest interventions in a package to reduce aflatoxin accumulation in groundnuts in Guinea. It is described how health benefits gained from each intervention, in terms of fewer aflatoxin-induced hepatocellular carcinoma cases, can be compared with the costs of implementing the interventions. It is found that both interventions would be extremely cost-effective if applied widely in African agriculture. That is, the monetized value of lives saved and quality of life gained by reducing aflatoxin-induced hepatocellular carcinoma far exceeds the cost of either biocontrol or the post-harvest intervention package to achieve those health benefits. The estimated cost-effectiveness ratio (CER; gross domestic product multiplied by disability-adjusted life years saved per unit cost) for biocontrol in Nigerian maize ranged from 5.10 to 24.8; while the estimated CER for the post-harvest intervention package in Guinean groundnuts ranged from 0.21 to 2.08. Any intervention with a CER > 1 is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be 'very cost-effective', while an intervention with a CER > 0.33 is considered 'cost-effective'.

Using geographically weighted (GW) models, we predicted grain yield for both environments. The relationship between measured phenotypic traits derived from imagery and grain yield was highly correlated (r = 0.74 and r = 0.46 [p < 0.001] for drought and irrigated environments, respectively). Residuals from GW models were lower and less spatially dependent than methods using principal component regression, suggesting the superiority of spatially corrected models. These results show that vegetation indices collected from high‐throughput UAS imagery can be used to predict grain and for selection decisions, as well as to enhance genomic selection models."

We conducted a case-control study to identify risk factors for contamination of implicated maize and, for the first time, quantitated biomarkers associated with acute aflatoxicosis. We administered questionnaires regarding maize storage and consumption and obtained maize and blood samples from participants. We recruited 40 case-patients with aflatoxicosis and 80 randomly selected controls to participate in this study. We analyzed maize for total aflatoxins and serum for aflatoxin B1-lysine albumin adducts and hepatitis B surface antigen. We used regression and survival analyses to explore the relationship between aflatoxins, maize consumption, hepatitis B surface antigen, and case status. Homegrown (not commercial) maize kernels from case households had higher concentrations of aflatoxins than did kernels from control households [geometric mean (GM) = 354.53 ppb vs. 44.14 ppb; p = 0.04]. Serum adduct concentrations were associated with time from jaundice to death [adjusted hazard ratio = 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-1.6]. Case patients had positive hepatitis B titers [odds ratio (OR) = 9.8; 95% CI, 1.5-63.1] more often than controls. Case patients stored wet maize (OR = 3.5; 95% CI, 1.2-10.3) inside their homes (OR = 12.0; 95% CI, 1.5-95.7) rather than in granaries more often than did controls. Aflatoxin concentrations in maize, serum aflatoxin B1-lysine adduct concentrations, and positive hepatitis B surface antigen titers were all associated with case status.

Given that the use of such pesticides on the farm is largely governed by voluntary behavior, it is important to understand what drives farmer behavior. Health belief models in public health and social psychology argue that persons who have adverse health experiences are likely to undertake preventive behavior. An analogous hypothesis set was tested here: farmers who believe they have had adverse health experiences from pesticides are likely to have heightened concerns about pesticides and are more likely to take greater precautions in dealing with pesticides. This work is based on an original survey of a population of 2700 corn and soybean growers in Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania using the U. S. Department of Agriculture data base. It was designed as a mail survey with telephone follow-up, and resulted in a 60 percent response rate. Farm operators report experiencing adverse health problems they believe are associated with pesticides that is equivalent to an incidence rate that is higher than the reported incidence of occupational pesticide poisonings, but similar to the reported incidence of all pesticide poisonings. Farmers who report experiencing such problems have more heightened concerns about water pollution from fertilizers and pesticides, and illness and injury from mixing, loading, and applying pesticides than farmers who have not experienced such problems. Farmers who report experiencing such problems also are more likely to report using alternative pest management practices than farmers who do not report having such problems. This implies that farmers who have had such experiences do care about the effects of application and do engage in alternative means of pest management, which at least involve the reduction in pesticide use."

Nematode communities from soil planted with the Bt-maize were compared to those from soil planted with the near-isogenic cultivar (with and without chemical insecticide treatment) and two conventional maize cultivars. The experimental field consisted of 40 plots in a completely randomized block design (eight plots for each treatment), which were monitored over two growing seasons (2008 and 2009) at six sampling dates for nematode diversity at the genus level in the rhizosphere soil. Physicochemical soil properties and Cry protein concentrations were also analyzed. Nematodes showed very high abundances, as well as a high diversity of taxa and functional guilds, indicating the relevance of maize fields as their habitat. Neither Bt-maize cultivation, nor insecticide treatment adversely affected abundance or community structure of nematode assemblages in field plots compared to several non-Bt cultivars including a near-isogenic cultivar.

The MON88017 event was therefore evaluated under field conditions in Southern Bohemia in 2009-2011, to detect possible impacts on the above-ground arthropod species. The study compared MON88017, its near-isogenic non-Bt hybrid DK315 (treated or not treated with the soil insecticide Dursban 10G) and two non-Bt reference hybrids (KIPOUS and PR38N86). Each hybrid was grown on five 0.5 ha plots distributed in a 14-ha field with a Latin square design. Semiquantitative ELISA was used to verify Cry3Bb1 toxin levels in the Bt maize. The species spectrum of non-target invertebrates changed during seasons and was affected by weather conditions. The thrips Frankliniella occidentalis was the most abundant species in all three successive years. The next most common species were aphids Rhopalosiphum padi and Metopolophium dirhodum. Frequently observed predators included Orius spp. and several species within the Coccinellidae. Throughout the three-year study, analysis of variance indicated some significant differences (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that the abundance and diversity of plant dwelling insects was similar in maize with the same genetic background, for both Bt (MON88017) and non-Bt (DK315) untreated or insecticide treated.

Linear relationships were identified between the chemical concentrations in the plant parts and the tested hydroponic concentrations. Root concentration factors were positively correlated with the specific lipophilicity (i. e. , logKow) of the tested FRs and were determined to be higher for the NBFRs than the OPFRs. The NBFRs had a higher root uptake rate than the OPFRs, and this trend was more significant with the increasing treatment concentrations. Shoot/root concentration factors were found to be lower than the unity value for 10 of the 11 tested compounds.

We collected 72 and 40 pairs of rice and maize grain samples, respectively, along with their rhizosphere soil samples and 6176 topsoil samples. The results showed that compared with the CA, the Cd pollution was more severe in the cultivated soil and crop grains around TMA. Furthermore, rice has a strong ability to transport Cd from soil to grains, whereas maize has a poor Cd uptake ability. The total organic carbon, CaO, pH, and Mn in soil play key roles in the transfer of Cd from soil to crop grains. Using these parameters and Cd concentration in soil, two sets of accurate Cd prediction models were developed for maize and rice. Based on the Cd concentration in the topsoil and predicted Cd concentration in crop grains, the safe utilization scheme of farmland was proposed. The proportions of priority protection, safe exploitation, planting adjustment, and strict control were 72.59%, 22.77%, 3.16%, and 1.48% in the TMA, respectively. The values reached 80.51% (priority protection), 19.12% (safe exploitation), 0.37% (planting adjustment), and 0% (strict control) in the CA.

Although regional differences were recognized, there was consensus about many of the priorities for research and effective management strategies. For preharvest management, genetic resistance and selecting adapted maize genotypes, along with insect management, were among the most fruitful strategies identified across the mycotoxin groups. For postharvest management, the most important practices included timely harvest, rapid grain drying, grain cleaning, and carefully managed storage conditions. Remediation practices such as optical sorting, density separation, milling, and chemical detoxification were also suggested. Future research and communication priorities included advanced breeding technologies, development of risk assessment tools, and the development and dissemination of regionally relevant management guidelines."

This study informs that endeavor by a risk assessment and economic analysis of two important mycotoxins: fumonisins and aflatoxins. The goals are to identify the nations that would be most heavily impacted by tighter mycotoxin regulations, examine costs and benefits as a function of regulatory stringency, and address risk-risk tradeoffs between health benefits and economic losses from compliance with those regulations. Among industrial nations, the United States would experience the heaviest economic losses from more precautionary mycotoxin standards. Environmental conditions in the developing world, however, are more conducive to mycotoxin accumulation in crops. Contrary to concerns expressed among policymakers, the less developed countries that would likely experience the greatest loss from tighter mycotoxin standards are not sub-Saharan African nations, but China and Argentina. If a fumonisin standard of 0.5 mg/kg were adopted worldwide, total export losses from fumonisins in corn may exceed 300 million dollars annually: 3-fold higher than if the less stringent U.

Likewise, export losses from aflatoxins in peanuts may exceed 450 million dollars under the current EU regulatory standard of 4 microg/kg: almost 5-fold higher than if the U.

In developing nations such as China where hepatitis B and C are prevalent, tighter aflatoxin standards may increase health risks until improved control methods for aflatoxins are found, as high-quality crops may be exported instead of being consumed domestically."

We determined dietary aflatoxin exposure of 170 lactating mothers breastfeeding children aged 6 months and below in a descriptive cross-sectional study involving aflatoxin analysis of maize-based cooked food samples (n = 48). Their socioeconomic characteristics, food consumption patterns and postharvest handling of maize were determined. Aflatoxins were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Statistical analysis was conducted using Statistical Package Software for Social Sciences (SPSS version 27) and Palisade's @Risk software. About 46% of the mothers were from low-income households, and 48.2% had not attained the basic level of education. A generally low dietary diversity was reported among 54.1% of lactating mothers. Food consumption pattern was skewed towards starchy staples. Approximately 50% never treated their maize, and at least 20% stored their maize in containers that promote aflatoxin contamination. Aflatoxin was detected in 85.4% of food samples. The mean of total aflatoxin was 97.8 μg/kg (standard deviation [SD], 57.7), while aflatoxin B1 was 9.0 μg/kg (SD, 7.7). The mean dietary intake of total aflatoxin and aflatoxin B1 was 7.6 μg/kg/b. w. t/day (SD, 7.5) and 0.6 (SD, 0.6), respectively. Dietary aflatoxin exposure of lactating mothers was high (margin of exposure < 10,000). Sociodemographic characteristics, food consumption patterns and postharvest handling of maize variably influenced dietary aflatoxin exposure of the mothers. The high prevalence and presence of aflatoxin in foods of lactating mothers are a public health concern and calls for the need to devise easy-to-use household food safety and monitoring measures in the study area."

The diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) technique and the traditional chemical extraction methods, including seven single-step extraction procedures and a five-step sequential extraction were used to predict the bioaccumulation of Se in plant. The result verified the presence of 50% of total Se in the form of residual Se fraction, followed by organic-bound and Fe-Mn oxide-bound Se fractions in soil. In addition, Se6+, Se4+, and Se2- were all detected in the solution extracted by H2O, KCl, phosphate-buffered solution (PBS), NaHCO3, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-2Na (EDTA-2Na) and ammonium bicarbonate-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (AB-DTPA), but Se6+ was not extracted by NaOH. The Se extracted by single-step extraction methods was weakly correlated with the Se uptake by plants with relatively high Se concentration (>3 mg·kg-1). The abilities of the tested methods to predict Se bioavailability in naturally Se-enriched soils declined in the following order: DGT > soil solution > PBS > KCl > H2O > NaHCO3 > EDTA > DTPA > NaOH. The ratio of CDGT to soil solution Se (Csoln) totaled 0.13, indicating an extremely low Se supply from the soil solid phase to the soil solution. Se measured by DGT was mainly derived from the soluble and exchangeable Se fractions that can accurately reflect the plant-absorbed Se pool. Therefore, the DGT technique is highly applicable in the simultaneous prediction of Se bioavailability in naturally Se-enriched soils."

Single and multiplex PCR assays indicated that strains belonging to F. meridionale (87/112) had a NIV genotype. The remainder strains (25/112), which belonged to F. boothii, had a DON genotype (based on single PCR assays) or 15ADON genotype (based on multiplex PCR assays). No strains tested were incorrectly diagnosed with a DON/NIV genotype. Chemical analysis indicated that the F. meridionale strains were NIV producers only (44/87), major NIV producers with unexpected high DON/NIV ratios (36/87), or unexpected major DON producers with minor NIV production (7/87). Strains with atypical DON/NIV production seem to be new phenotypes under a putative NIV genotype, since PCR assays do not provide evidences of a new trichothecene genotype. DON production and absence of its acetylated forms were shown for strains of F. boothii. The inconsistencies between genetic and chemical data highlight the risk of inferring the trichothecenes potentially contaminating food and feedstuffs based only on PCR assays.

Adults were fed pollen from Bt maize varieties or their corresponding near isolines together with sucrose solution for 28 days. Survival, pre-oviposition period, fecundity, fertility and dry weight were not different between Bt or non-Bt maize pollen treatments. In order to ensure that adults of C. carnea are not sensitive to the tested toxins independent from the plant background and to add certainty to the hazard assessment, adult C. carnea were fed with artificial diet containing purified Cry3Bb1 or Cry1Ab at about a 10 times higher concentration than in maize pollen. Artificial diet containing Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) was included as a positive control. No differences were found in any life-table parameter between Cry protein containing diet treatments and control diet. However, the pre-oviposition period, daily and total fecundity and dry weight of C. carnea were significantly negatively affected by GNA-feeding. In both feeding assays, the stability and bioactivity of Cry proteins in the food sources as well as the uptake by C. carnea was confirmed.

For situ measuring the bioavailability of heavy metals, the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) is superior to other traditional methods. It is also important to find a method for predicting heavy metal enrichment in maize based on the DGT method. In this study, field surveys were conducted in the main maize producing areas of Tianjin, China. Heavy metal concentrations in maize grains were predicted by coupling DGT with traditional extraction methods. The results show that coupling DGT with soil solution can significantly improve prediction accuracy (Cd-R2 = 0.908, Ni-R2 = 0.903, and Zn-R2 = 0.904). This indicated that DGT and soil solution were feasible predictors of heavy metal concentration in maize. The DGT induced fluxes in soil/sediment (DIFS) model was used to simulate the uptake process of heavy metals by DGT, and better reveal the desorption processes of heavy metals in soils. DIFS-based desorption processes were employed to characterize the resupply ability of heavy metals in soils. The coupling of DGT and DIFS parameters provided the best prediction accuracy in this study (Cd-R2 = 0.920, Ni-R2 = 0.928, and Zn-R2 = 0.908). Predictions are slightly weaker for Zn than for Cd and Ni (Cd-P < 0.01, Ni-P < 0.01, and Zn-P < 0.05). The reason is that the average resupply type of Cd and Ni in soil is partially sustained while Zn is resupplied via diffusion only. The desorption rate k-1 can excellently improve the prediction accuracy of DGT, which avoids the disadvantage that soil solution does not consider desorption. The coupling of DGT and DIFS parameters provides an accurate and reliable method for predicting heavy metal enrichment in maize."

In oxidizing environments, (99)Tc is expected to occur as pertechnetate ((99)TcO(4)(-)). Due to its high mobility, leaching of this element in the field might be important, potentially affecting the reliability of estimated transfer parameters of (99)Tc as measured in closed experimental systems such as hydroponics or pot experiments. The aim of this experiment was to measure the leaching of (99)Tc in undisturbed irrigated soil cores under cultivation as well as plant uptake and to study the possible competition between the two transfer pathways. Undisturbed soil cores (50 x 50 cm) were sampled from a Rendzic Leptosol (R), a colluvial Fluvic Cambisol (F) and a Dystric Cambisol (D) using PVC tubes (three cores sampled per soil type). Each core was equipped with a leachate collector at the bottom, allowing the monitoring of (99)Tc leaching through the cores. Cores were placed in a greenhouse and maize (Zea mays L. , cv. DEA, Pioneer) was sown. After 135 d, maize was harvested and radioactivity determined in both plant and water samples. Results showed that during the growing period, leaching of (99)Tc was limited, due to the high evapotranspiration rate of maize. After harvest, leaching of (99)Tc went on because of the absence of evapotranspiration. Effective uptake (EU) of (99)Tc in leaves and grains was calculated. EU reached 70% of the input in the leaves and was not significantly different among soils. These results confirmed those obtained from pot experiments, even though leaching was allowed to occur in close-to-reality hydraulical conditions. As a consequence, it was concluded that pot experiments are an adequate surrogate for more complex ""close-to-reality"" experimental systems for measuring transfer factors."

To this end, global proteomic analysis employing LC-MS/MS of gluten-enriched extracts derived from 12 barley cultivars was undertaken, providing a foundation for the development of MS-based quantitative methodologies that would enable the detection of barley contamination in foods. Subsequently, a number of candidate barley-specific peptide markers were evaluated by multiple-reaction monitoring MS. From an initial panel of 26, 9 peptide markers were unique to barley, yet present in a wide range of barley varieties. The analytical method was then used to examine a range of breakfast cereals and was able to detect barley in a barley-based breakfast cereal and a muesli, but additionally allowed detection of contamination of cereals that were comprised of ancient grains and in commercially-sourced flours, including amaranth, chia, buckwheat, millet, rice, corn, oats, rye, spelt and green wheat (0.01-0.08%). LC-MS/MS provides an alternative to ELISA approaches to monitor food safety and the identification of robust and sensitive cereal-specific peptide markers is the first step toward the adoption of this technology. Coeliac disease is a serious health issue affecting up to 70million people globally for which there is no cure. The only treatment is a life-long gluten-free diet. Contamination of foods can occur at many stages of food production from farm to fork. As such, accurate quantification and identification of the source (i. e. cereal) and type (e. g. gluten) of contamination is critical to the health and well-being of a subset of the population, including those affected by coeliac disease and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity."

The geometric mean concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were 22.3 and 11.9 ng/g in peanut and 16.6 and 13.6 ng/g in corn, respectively. Decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE, 6.07 ng/g) and dechlorane plus (DPs, 6.22 ng/g) also showed significant concentrations in peanuts. The plant uptake was initiated from root absorption at the emergence stage but it was subsequently surpassed by leaves absorption from the air since the late seedling stage or early reproductive stage. There was a rapid uptake of lower halogenated HOCs at the early vegetative stages in both species. However, robust uptake of highly halogenated compounds at the reproductive stages suggests a delayed accumulation of them by the plants. PBDE and PCB congener profiles suggest more noticeable tendency for inter-compartment translocation in peanut than in corn during the plant development. The DP and HBCD isomeric compositions in peanut (enriched with syn-DP and γ-HBCD) were different from those in the rhizosphere soils and air, suggesting a more stereoisomer-selective uptake and/or biotransformation in this species compared to corn. The bioaccumulation factors for root-soil and stem-root of these HOCs in most cases were <1. The tissue-distributions demonstrated that leaves serve as a significant reservoir of absorbed HOCs under the field conditions, whereas the low concentrations in peanut and corn kernels indicated translocation of most HOCs into this compartment was significantly hindered (especially for highly halogenated compounds)."

Among the available methods for prevention and control of aflatoxin, the application of antifungal bacteria has gained favor in recent years. An endophytic bacterium MS455, isolated from soybean, exhibited broad-spectrum antifungal activity against economically important pathogens, including Aspergillus flavus. MS455 was identified as a strain of Burkholderia based on genomic analysis. Random and site-specific mutations were used in discovery of the genes that share high homology to the ocf gene cluster of Burkholderia contaminans strain MS14, which is responsible for production of the antifungal compound occidiofungin. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that ORF1, a homolog to the ambR1 LuxR-type regulatory gene, regulates occidiofungin biosynthesis in MS455. Additionally, 284 differentially expressed genes, including 138 upregulated and 146 downregulated genes, suggesting that, in addition to its role in occidiofungin production, ORF1 is involved in expression of multiple genes, especially those involved in ornibactin biosynthesis. Plate bioassays showed the growth of A. flavus was significantly inhibited by the wild-type strain MS455 as compared with the ORF1 mutant. Similarly, corn kernel assays showed that growth of A. flavus and aflatoxin production were reduced significantly by MS455 as compared with buffer control and the ORF1 mutant. Collectively, the results demonstrated that production of occidiofungin is essential for antifungal activity of the endophytic bacterium MS455.

Samples (n = 1549) were collected across six communities and six time points spanning a calendar year and were analyzed for mycotoxins using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. AFB1 and FB1 were common across surveyed villages, with moderate to high detection rates (45-75%) observed across commodities. AFB1 levels in maize and groundnuts and FB1 levels in maize and pearl millet frequently exceeded regulatory threshold levels of 15 μg/kg (AFB1) and 2 μg/g (FB1). DON was analyzed in wheat, with 3% of samples yielding detectable levels and none exceeding 1 μg/g. In rice, AFB1 levels were highest in the bran and husk and lower in the kernel. Commodity type significantly influenced AFB1 detection status, while commodity type, season, and visual quality influenced samples' legal status. Storage characteristics and household socioeconomic status indicators did not have significant effects on contamination. No significant effects of any variables on FB1 detection or legal status were observed. Data on mycotoxin contamination, combined with data on local dietary intake, were used to estimate spatiotemporal mycotoxin exposure profiles. Estimated seasonal per capita exposure levels for AFB1 (5.4-39.3 ng/kg body weight/day) and FB1 (~0-2.4 μg/kg body weight/day) exceeded provisional maximum tolerable daily intake levels (1 ng/kg body weight/day for AFB1 and 2 μg/kg body weight/day for FB1) in some seasons and locations.

Indirectly, climate change may influence such hazards (e. g. the occurrence of mycotoxins) due to geographic shifts in the distribution of major cereal cropping systems and the consequences this may have for crop rotations. This paper analyses the impact of climate on cropping shares of maize, oat and wheat on a 50-km square grid across Europe (45-65°N) and provides model-based estimates of the changes in cropping shares in response to changes in temperature and precipitation as projected for the time period around 2040 by two regional climate models (RCM) with a moderate and a strong climate change signal, respectively. The projected cropping shares are based on the output from the two RCMs and on algorithms derived for the relation between meteorological data and observed cropping shares of maize, oat and wheat. The observed cropping shares show a south-to-north gradient, where maize had its maximum at 45-55°N, oat had its maximum at 55-65°N, and wheat was more evenly distributed along the latitudes in Europe. Under the projected climate changes, there was a general increase in maize cropping shares, whereas for oat no areas showed distinct increases. For wheat, the projected changes indicated a tendency towards higher cropping shares in the northern parts and lower cropping shares in the southern parts of the study area. The present modelling approach represents a simplification of factors determining the distribution of cereal crops, and also some uncertainties in the data basis were apparent. A promising way of future model improvement could be through a systematic analysis and inclusion of other variables, such as key soil properties and socio-economic conditions, influencing the comparative advantages of specific crops."

Present study was undertaken to classify 240 maize kernels inoculated with six different concentrations (25, 40, 70, 200, 300 and 500 ppb) of aflatoxin-B1 by using Vis-NIR HSI. The reflectance spectral data were pre-processed (multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), standard normal variate (SNV), Savitsky-Golay smoothing and their combinations) and classified using partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and k-nearest neighbour (k-NN). PLS model was also developed to predict the concentration of aflatoxin-B1in naturally contaminated maize kernels inoculated with Aspergillus flavus. The potential wavelength (508 nm) was selected based on principal component analysis (PCA) loadings to distinguish between sterile and infected maize kernels. PCA score plots revealed a distinct separation of low contaminated samples (25, 40 and 70 ppb) from highly contaminated samples (200, 300 and 500 ppb) without any overlapping of data. The maximum classification accuracy of 94.7% was obtained using PLS-DA with SNV pre-processed data. Across all the combinations of pre-processing and classification models, the best efficiency (98.2%) was exhibited by k-NN model with raw data.

The relative infrequency of the A. flavus SBG strains, producing small sclerotia and high levels of both aflatoxins (B and G), suggests that long-term chronic exposure to this mycotoxin are a much higher health risk in West Africa than is the acute toxicity due to very highly contaminated maize in east Africa."

ARCIE can be used to assess whether a receptor location has capacity to accommodate additional source emissions while complying with regulatory limits. We present CF as a midpoint indicator of health impacts per unit mass of emitted pollutant. Source CF Ratio enables comparison of potential new-source locations based on human health impacts. The AHI Ratio estimates the health impacts of a pollutant in relation to the utilization of the source for each unit of product or service. These metrics can be applied to any pollutant, energy source sector (e. g. , agriculture, electricity), source type (point, line, area), and spatial modeling domain (nation, state, city, region).

Intermediate wheatgrass (IWG; Thinopyrum intermedium) is a perennial grass being domesticated to serve as the world’s first widely available perennial grain crop. Our objective was to measure water quality variables and crop yields in order to model NO₃-N leaching beneath IWG, maize, and switchgrass under three N fertilizer treatments; low N (0 kg N ha⁻¹), medium N (maize = 80, switchgrass and IWG = 40 kg N ha⁻¹), and high N (maize = 160, switchgrass and IWG = 120 or 160 kg N ha⁻¹). The switchgrass and IWG medium N treatments also included alfalfa as an intercrop. The NO₃-N concentration in soil solution 50 cm below the surface was one and two orders of magnitude lower in high N fertilized IWG compared to switchgrass and maize, respectively. Soil solution NO₃-N increased with N fertilizer in all crops. Soil water content was less at 50 and 100 cm depths in IWG compared to switchgrass and maize but was unaffected by N fertilizer treatment.

Despite consistent biomass yields through time, IWG grain yields decreased with stand age at all N fertilizer treatments. Alfalfa did not persist in the IWG and switchgrass medium N treatments, thus other legumes should be tested for intercropping with perennial grain crops. Intermediate wheatgrass has great potential to provide food-quality grain and biomass while preventing NO₃-N leaching."

India being a tropical country provides suitable conditions for fungal invasion to the cereals. In the absence of any regulatory limits for ZEA in India, the present study was carried out to analyze the contamination levels of ZEA in different cereal samples consumed by Indian population and its exposure assessment through intake. Out of 117 cereal samples comprising of wheat, rice, corn, and oats, 70 (84%) were found to be positive for ZEA contamination, among which 24 (33%) samples exceeded the permissible limits proposed by European Union when analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The positive samples were further validated by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS) analysis. Based on the quantitative estimation of ZEA contamination in cereals and their daily consumption values, the probable daily intake of ZEA was found to be 16.9- and 7.9-fold higher in rice and wheat samples, respectively, than the tolerable daily intake prescribed by European Food Safety Authority. The presence of ZEA at high levels indicates a higher exposure risk for Indian population as wheat and rice are staple foods in India. Thus, there is an immediate need to set the permissible levels of ZEA in India to safeguard the health of 1.34 billion people.

Another objective was to compare model predictions with observed data. Probabilistic exposure modeling for dietary As was conducted with the Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation Dietary (SHEDS-Dietary) model, based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The dose modeling was conducted by combining the SHEDS-Dietary model with the MENTOR-3P (Modeling ENvironment for TOtal Risk with Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling for Populations) system. Model evaluation was conducted via comparing exposure and dose-modeling predictions against duplicate diet data and biomarker measurements, respectively, for the same individuals. The mean modeled tAs exposure from food is 0.38 microg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times higher than the mean As exposures from the drinking water. The mean iAs exposure from food is 0.05 microg/kg/day (1.96 microg/day), which is approximately two times higher than the mean iAs exposures from the drinking water. The modeled exposure and dose estimates matched well with the duplicate diet data and measured As biomarkers. The major food contributors to iAs exposure were the following: vegetables (24%); fruit juices and fruits (18%); rice (17%); beer and wine (12%); and flour, corn, and wheat (11%). Approximately 10% of tAs exposure from foods is the toxic iAs form. The general U. S. population may be exposed to tAs and iAs more from eating some foods than from drinking water. In addition, this model evaluation effort provides more confidence in the exposure assessment tools used."

All samples were found to be contaminated with aflatoxin and zearalenone while ochratoxin was not detected in any sample. Bread showed the reduction in mycotoxins level for autumn and spring season as (55 and 51%) for aflatoxins (AFs) and (84 and 63% for zearalenone (ZEA) for autumn and spring season's samples.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The potential presence of mycotoxins in maize is a major health concern for the producers as well as consumers. Mycotoxins presence in food supply chain is result of poor storage condition favoring growth of mold. The mold produces secondary metabolites, mycotoxins. Mycotoxins once become part of maize will be carried out with supply chain. Therefore, monitoring of mycotoxins is necessary to assess their concentration so that food can be made safe for the consumer. Other than quantification of mycotoxins, analysis of mycotoxins behavior toward processing or heat have significant importance for the maize processing industry. This study provides quantification and fate of mycotoxins during processing of maize and nixtamalization.

Samples were collected for the determination of Fusarium infection and fumonisin (B1, B2 and B3) contamination. A previous paper reported Aspergillus infection and aflatoxin contamination of these samples. Fusarium infection levels, measured by per cent kernels infected, were modest with mean levels for the above cereals of 16% ± 11% (SD), 12% ± 7% and 13% ± 16%, respectively. However, the Fusarium species recovered from maize were predominantly the fumonisin producers F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum, together making an infection rate of 15% ± 10%, whereas these species were present to a limited extent only in the other two cereals, 1% ± 1% for pearl millet and 2% ± 6% for sorghum. Fumonisin contamination was variable but reflected the diversity of Fusarium producers in these three cereals. Mean levels were 228 ± 579 µg kg(-1) (range < 5-2860 µg kg(-1)) for maize, 18 ± 7 µg kg(-1) (range = 6-29 µg kg(-1)) for pearl millet and 131 ± 270 µg kg(-1) (range < 5-1340 µg kg(-1)) for sorghum. Together with previous results on aflatoxin, this study confirmed the co-occurrence of aflatoxins and fumonisins in maize as well as in the traditional African cereals, millet and sorghum (89% co-occurrence across all three cereals). The low fumonisin levels may be ascribed to the use of good agricultural practices. Of the Fusarium species present, those in maize consisted mainly of fumonisin producers, the opposite of what was observed in pearl millet and sorghum. It is concluded that replacement of maize by pearl millet and sorghum could improve food safety with regards to aflatoxin B and fumonisin B exposure."

The deleterious physiological effects of mycotoxins on humans are still a first-priority question. In food production and also in the case of acute and chronic poisoning, there are possibilities to set suitable food safety measures into operation to minimize the effects of mycotoxin contaminations.

Significantly, egg shell and java plum seed displayed the greatest As(III) elimination (78-87%) at 7 pH followed by water chestnut shell (75%), corn cob (67%), tea waste (74%) and pomegranate peel (65%). In contrast, 71% and 67% of As(V) was removed at pH 4.1 and 5.3 by egg shell and java plum seed, respectively. The maximum As(V) and As(III) sorption by all the biosorbents was obtained, notably for egg shell and java plum seed, after 2 h contact time. Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second order models best fitted the sorption data for both forms of As. The -OH, -COOH, -NH2 and sulfur-bearing surface functional groups were possibly involved for As(III) and As(V) removal by biosorbents. The scanning electron microscopy combined with the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) analysis showed that the heterogeneous surface of biosorbents, possessing rough and irregular areas, could have led to As sorption. Both As(V) and As(III) were successfully desorbed (up to 97%) from the biosorbents in four sorption/desorption (regeneration) cycles. This pilot-scale study highlights that egg shell and java plum seed have the greatest ability to remove both As species from As-contaminated drinking water.

Several disease incidence models have been commercialized for wheat, but only one toxin prediction model from Ontario, Canada, ""DONcast"", has been validated extensively and commercialized to date for wheat, and another has been proposed for maize. In the development of these predictive tools, the variation in toxin levels associated with year and agronomic effects was estimated from simple linear models using wheat and maize samples taken from farm fields. In wheat, environment effects accounted for 48% of the variation in deoxynivalenol (DON) across all fields, followed by variety (27%), and previous crop (14 to 28%). In maize, hybrid accounted for 25% of the variation of either DON or fumonisin, followed by environment (12%), and when combined 42% of the variability was accounted for. The robust site-specific, DON forecast model accounted for up to 80% of the variation in DON, and has been used commercially for 5 years in Canada. Forecasting DON and fumonisins in maize is more difficult, because of its greater exposure to infection, the role of wounding in infection, the more important role of hybrid susceptibility, and the vast array of uncharacterized hybrids available in the marketplace. Nevertheless, using data collected from controlled experiments conducted in Argentina and the Philippines, a model was developed to predict fumonisin concentration using insect damage and weather variables, accounting for 82% of the variability of fumonisins. Using mycotoxins as a measure of disease outcome, as opposed to disease symptoms, offers a more robust prediction of mycotoxin risk, and it accounts for mycotoxin accumulation that occurs frequently in the absence of any change in Fusarium symptoms."

Although previous studies suggest possible role of oxidative stress, the precise mechanisms of PCB-induced ROS production in liver still remain to be fully assessed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different doses of PCBs on the parameters of oxidative stress and to investigate whether these effects are dose dependent. Furthermore, a comparison between calculated benchmark doses (BMD) and estimated NOAEL values for investigated parameters, was made. Six groups of male albino Wistar rats (7 animals per group) were receiving Aroclor 1254 dissolved in corn oil in the doses of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 mg PCBs/kg b. w. /day by oral gavage during 28 days while control animals were receiving corn oil only.

Hepatic enzymes AST, ALT, ALP and protein albumin were also determined in serum as clinical parameters of liver function. Collected data on the investigated parameters were analyzed by the BMD method. The results of this study demonstrate that subacute exposure to PCBs causes induction of oxidative stress in liver with dose-dependent changes of the investigated parameters, although more pronounced adverse effects were observed on enzymatic than on non-enzymatic components of antioxidant protection.

To investigate the HMs concentrations in a soil-maize system, a total of 41 paired soil-maize samples were collected from a typical indigenous zinc-smelting area of northwestern Guizhou Province, China. Results showed that the concentrations of the targeted HMs in the soil were significantly higher than their corresponding background values of Guizhou Province. Results obtained of the geo-accumulation index (Igeo) and the potential ecological risk factor of an individual metal (E r i ) revealed that Cd and Pb were identified as the top-priority control HMs in the study area. The mean concentrations in maize grain decreased in the order of Zn > Pb > Cu > Cd. Bio-accumulation factor (BAF) indicated a strong ability for Cd to be accumulated in the maize root. Translocation factor (TF) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy revealed that the maize root played an important role in reducing the mobilization of HMs to stem, except for Zn. Kriging interpolation results illustrated that the spatial distribution patterns of HMs in the maize grain were generally similar to those in sampled soil, and the higher concentrations for the investigated HMs were partially overlapping between soil and maize grain. The average hazard quotient (HQ) of the investigated HMs for both children and adults were all lower than the threshold value (HQ = 1). The total hazard index (HI) was 5.51E-01 and 4.24E-01 for the two population groups, respectively, implying no potential non-carcinogenic risk for local maize-consumers. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the oral ingestion rate (IngR) of grain was the predominated contribution to the output of the risk assessment."

Hg concentrations in four Hg treatment groups were higher than the control group in dose-dependent manner. The deposition of 6 mg kg-1 Hg was the highest. Corn stover biochar decreased Hg migration from soil to leaching solution and spinach, and passivation effect of 7% concentration of corn stover biochar was the best. Besides, corn stover biochar relieved the increase of methyl Hg caused by Hg in soil. Moreover, Hg concentration in roots was the highest and Hg concentration in stems was the lowest in spinach. Furthermore, Hg absorbed by roots was more than the sum of Hg absorbed by stems and leaves. In addition, we also found that the measured soil Hg concentrations were coincided with the predicted soil Hg concentrations under 1, 2, and 4 mg kg-1 Hg concentrations, except 2 mg kg-1 Hg at 7% C.

Three benzo analogs, namely octyl gallate (OG), trans-cinnamaldehyde (CA), and 2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzaldehyde (2H5M), at 1 g L-1 (3.54 mmol), 1 mL L-1 (7.21 mmol), 1 mL L-1 (5.39 mmol), respectively, achieved ≥99.9% fungal death after 0.5, 2.5 or 24 h of treatments, respectively, in in vitro phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) bioassay. However, when OG, CA, and 2H5M were examined in commercial food matrices, organic apple, or grape juices, only CA maintained a similar level of antifungal activity, compared with a PBS bioassay. trans-Cinnamaldehyde showed higher antifungal activity at pH 3.5, equivalent to that of commercial fruit juices, than at pH 5.6. In soil sample tests, the application of 1 mL L-1 (7.21 mmol) CA to conventional maize / tomato soil samples (pH 6.8) for 2.5 h resulted in ≥99.9% fungal death, indicating CA could also eliminate fungal contaminants in soil. While the conventional fungicide thiabendazole exerted antifungal activity comparable to CA, thiabendazole enhanced the production of carcinogenic aflatoxins by Aspergillus flavus, an undesirable side effect. trans-Cinnamaldehyde could be developed as a potent antifungal agent in food processing or soil sanitation by reducing the time / cost necessary for fungal removal.

Dictionary: {}</s>",{'Glufosinate ammonium': ['phosphinothricin ammonium']}</s>,"Glufosinate ammonium (phosphinothricin ammonium) (GLA) is the active ingredient of Basta and several other herbicides used worldwide. It is produced as part of the tripeptide L-phosphinothricyl-L-alanyl-L-alanin, which was first isolated from Streptomyces viridichromogenes or Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Its structure is confirmed by degradation and synthesis. Several processes for the preparation of D,L- and L-phosphinothricin are described. Glufosinate is a structural analog of glutamate and inhibits the glutamine synthetase. The result is a rapid build-up of a high ammonia level and a concomitant depletion of glutamine and several other amino acids in the plant. These effects are accompanied by a rapid decline of photosynthetic CO2-fixation and are followed by chlorosis and desiccation. The results of numerous toxicological studies show that glufosinate ammonium and its commercial formulations are safe for users and consumers under the conditions of recommended use. The fast and complete degradation in soil and surface water prevents movement of residues into groundwater. The toxicological threshold levels for all the nontarget organisms tested are well above the potential exposure levels and therefore do not reflect any hazard for nontarget organisms in the ecosystem. Basta is a nonselective foliar applied herbicide for the control of undesirable mono- and dicotyledonous plants in orchards, vineyards, and plantations for minimum tillage, and as a harvest aid. A synthetic phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT) gene has been introduced via Agrobacterium tumefaciens into dicot crops, such as like tobacco, tomato, spring and winter rapeseed, alfalfa, and several horticultural crops. The PAT gene was also successfully introduced into maize protoplasts that could be regenerated into fertile plants. All transgenic crop plants tolerated a two- to threefold field dosage of Basta."

Plasma samples collected in 2002 and again in 2004 from 218 children attending two schools in neighboring villages were assayed for aflatoxin exposure using the aflatoxin-albumin adduct (AF-alb) biomarker. Data were previously examined for associations among hepatomegaly, malaria, and schistosomiasis. AF-alb levels were high in children from both schools, but the geometric mean (95% confidence interval) in year 2002 was significantly higher in Matangini [206.5 (175.5, 243.0) pg/mg albumin] than in Yumbuni [73.2 (61.6, 87.0) pg/mg; p < 0.001].

To this end, available models and input data were chained together in a modelling framework. As a case study, we focused on maize grown in Eastern Europe and imported to the Netherlands to be fed-as part of dairy cows' compound feed-to dairy cows in the Netherlands. Three different climate models, one aflatoxin B1 prediction model and five different carryover models were used. For this particular case study of East European maize, most of the calculations suggest an increase (up to 50%) of maximum mean aflatoxin M1 in milk by 2030, except for one climate (DMI) model suggesting a decrease. Results from all combinations of carryover and climate models suggest a similar or slight increase (up to 0.6%) of the chance of finding aflatoxin M1 in milk above the EC limit of 0.05 μg/kg by 2030. Results varied mainly with the climate model data and carryover model considered. The model framework infrastructure is flexible so that forecasting models for other mycotoxins or other food safety hazards as well as other production chains, together with necessary input databases, can easily be included as well. This modelling framework for the first time links datasets and models related to aflatoxin B1 in maize and related aflatoxin M1 the dairy production chain to obtain a unique predictive methodology based on Monte Carlo simulation. Such an integrated approach with scenario analysis provides possibilities for policy makers and risk managers to study the effects of changes in the beginning of the chain on the end product."

Two soils with different physicochemical properties, namely a calcareous soil and an acidic soil, were used. The total and available Zn in the soils were correlated with the Zn in the plants (roots and shoots) and the observed effects. In the calcareous soil, the available Zn was very low and the phytotoxicity was limited to a slight reduction in the biomass for wheat, cucumber, and beet at the highest concentration. Only beet showed an increase in photosynthetic pigments. The parameters related to oxidative stress were affected to different degrees depending on the crop, with the exceptions of maize, lettuce, pea, and beet. In the acidic soil, the available Zn was high, and the germination of bean, tomato, lettuce, and beet, and the growth of most of the crops were seriously affected. The calculated EC50 values (growth) in the acidic soil ranged from 110 to 520 mg Zn kg-1.

To test this hypothesis, a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial study was conducted. Rats were fed diets with adequate or marginal amounts of dietary Zn, Fe, or Ca. The basal diets contained 40% unenriched, milled rice fortified with 0.62 mg of Cd/kg as CdCl2 (0.25 mg of Cd/kg diet). Rat consumed the diets for 5 weeks and then were fed 1 g of a similar diet containing 10(9)Cd-labeled rice. After 2 weeks, whole-body (WB) retention of 109Cd was determine. Rats then were killed, and the organs were removed for total Cd determinations. Rats fed marginal concentrations of dietary Zn had slightly but significantly more WB retention of 109Cd than controls; however, rats fed marginal Fe or Ca had as much as 3-fold higher retention of the label. Rats fed marginal amounts of Zn, Fe, and Ca combined retained as much as 8 times more 109Cd than rats fed adequate minerals. The effects on Cd concentrations in liver and kidney were similar to the effects on 109Cd retention. These results support the hypothesis that populations exposed to dietary sources of Cd and subsisting on marginal mineral intakes could be at greater risk than well-nourished populations exposed to similar amounts of dietary Cd. Thus, different food crops can cause unequal Cd risk at equal Cd concentration if diets containing the food are not balanced to provide adequate interacting mineral concentrations."

An epidemiological investigation was conducted, including a review of the clinical records of the persons exposed, laboratory testing of the pathological specimens collected, environmental testing of the food samples and food preparation areas. A total of 164 children developed clinical symptoms of AGE following ingestion of processed maize meal, beans and vegetables. Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg (S. Heidelberg) was the causative agent for this AGE outbreak in 92.0% of the cases. The median duration of illness was 2 days with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.6%. The main food product that was contaminated was samp (processed maize meal) that had been poorly stored and prepared (53.4%). A timeously-initiated epidemiological, environmental and microbiological an investigation led to the conclusion that the etiologic agent of this outbreak was S. Heidelberg, and the most probable food vehicle of transmission was cooked samp served to learners within the NSNP."

The novel feature of this method is that the sample purification is carried out as a part of the assay, and a separate sample cleanup step is not required. The assay procedure involves the sequential addition of standard or sample, cleaning solutions, and aflatoxin B1-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (AFB1-HRP) over antibody-spotted zones of a membrane, and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine was used as the substrate for visualization. We have determined that trifluoroacetic acid and propionic acids at concentrations of 100 mM are highly effective for cleaning groundnut, wheat, corn, and poultry feed samples and that NaHCO3 (100 mM) is successful in cleaning processed soybean. In all cases, subsequent washing was performed with phosphate-buffered saline solution to facilitate the removal of traces of adhering interfering substances. A batch of 12 samples can be analyzed within 8 min either by visual comparison of the color intensity (inversely related to the analyte concentration) of a sample spot with those of reference standards or, more precisely, by densitometry. The method was tested for the analysis of AFB1 in groundnut, wheat, corn, processed soybean, chili, and poultry feed. The detection limit obtained was 5 microg/kg, except for chili, where it was 10 microg/kg. The average recoveries from different noninfected food samples spiked with AFB1 at concentrations of 5 to 100 microg/kg were between 99 and 105%. The values obtained for infected corn and groundnut samples correlated well with the estimates obtained by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The absence of a sample extraction step reduces the cost and labor involved in the assay. The method may be potentially applicable to the assay of other mycotoxins and environmental pollutants."

Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) has been implicated in the etiology of acute and chronic disease in humans and animals, including growth stunting, liver cancer and death. Cost effective and culturally acceptable intervention strategies for the reduction of dietary AFB1 exposure are of critical need in populations at high risk for aflatoxicosis. Fermented gruels consisting of cornmeal are a common source for such exposure and are consumed by both children and adults in many countries with a history of frequent, high-level aflatoxin exposure. One proposed method to reduce aflatoxins in the diet is to include a selective enterosorbent, Uniform Particle Size NovaSil (UPSN), as a food additive in contaminated foods. For UPSN to be effective in this capacity, it must be stable in complex, acidic mixtures that are often exposed to heat during the process of fermented gruel preparation. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to test the ability of UPSN to sorb aflatoxin while common cooking conditions were applied. The influence of fermentation, heat treatment, acidity, and processing time were investigated with and without UPSN. Analyses were performed using the field-practical Vicam assay with HPLC verification of trends. Our findings demonstrated that UPSN significantly reduced aflatoxin levels (47-100%) in cornmeal, regardless of processing conditions. Upon comparison of each element tested, time appeared to be the primary factor influencing UPSN efficacy. The greatest decreases in AFB1 were reported in samples allowed to incubate (with or without fermentation) for 72 hrs. This data suggests that addition of UPSN to staple corn ingredients likely to contain aflatoxins would be a sustainable approach to reduce exposure."

The use of chemical control agents is more effective in the larval instar than for the adult insects, due to limited mobility of the larvae in water and their higher sensitivity. Besides, acting in the initial phase is preferable because the mosquito is not yet a vector of diseases. Ae. aegypti, however, developed resistance to common synthetic larvicides that furthermore have a negative impact on both the environment and human health. It is, therefore, necessary to search for new and eco-friendly replacements. Essential oils that are used as natural larvicides are often limited in their applicability as they are poorly water-soluble, degrade easily and volatilize when applied as free oil. These limitations can, however, be overcome using microencapsulation. Thyme essential oil (TEO) contains thymol, an active compound that has a range of biological activities (antioxidant, antimicrobial, insecticidal). The objective of this work was to develop a low-cost bio-degradable larvicide system for controlled release of TEO that is to be applied in small containers in and around households. The controlled release system was prepared by thermoplastic extrusion using corn starch as wall material. The TEO was chemically determined by gas-chromatography to contain 53% w/w of thymol, and its larvicidal activity was determined. The release of the thymol from the particles is demonstrated to correlate with the swelling of the matrix when immersed in water. The particles are effective against larvae from susceptible (Rockefeller) and resistant strains, reduce the required lethal concentration by a factor 3 as compared with the non-encapsulated TEO and significantly prolonged the residual effect, maintaining 100% of larvae mortality for 10 days more than non-encapsulated TEO."

The objectives of this research were thus to study the populations of Aspergillus section Flavi in six northern Italian regions and obtain information on the relative role of the key species, ability to produce sclerotia, production of the main toxic secondary metabolites, aflatoxins and cyclopiazonic acid, and tolerance of key environmental parameters. A total of 70 strains were isolated and they included the toxigenic species A. flavus and A. parasiticus. A. flavus was dominant in the populations studied, representing 93% of the strains. Seventy percent of strains of Aspergillus section Flavi produced AFs, with 50% of strains also producing cyclopiazonic acid. Sixty-two percent of A. flavus strains and 80% of A. parasiticus were able to produce sclerotia at 30 degrees C. Using 5/2 agar, only 1 strain developed S sclerotia and 19 L sclerotia. With regard to ecological studies, growth of Aspergillus section Flavi was optimal at between 25 and 30 degrees C, while AFB(1) production was optimal at 25 degrees C. Regarding water availability (water activity, a(w)), 0.99 a(w) was optimal for both growth and AFs production, while the only aflatoxin produced in the driest condition tested (0.83 a(w)) was AFB(1).

Therefore, as a possible treatment for the remediation of a HMs contaminated soil (sewage water irrigation for 20-years), the impact of biochar (BC) was investigated on the uptake of HMs by wheat (Triticum aestivum L. ) plants. The BC was produced from seven different feedstocks (cotton stalks (CSBC), rice straw (RSBC), poultry manure (PMBC), lawn grass (LGBC), vegetable peels (VPBC), maize straw (MSBC), and rice husks (RHBC)). Each BC was applied at 1.25% (dry weight basis, w/w) in contaminated soil and a control was maintained without BC addition and wheat was grown in potted soil and harvested at maturity. Results revealed that the properties of different biochars regulated their effects on soil nutrient and HMs mobility and uptake by plants. The maximum plant phosphorous and potassium uptake and translocation to grain (173.4% and 341%, respectively) was found in RSBC treatment over control. The RHBC, PMBC, and MSBC treatments showed a maximum decrease in grain Cd concentration (32.9%, 33.8%, and 34.1%, respectively) compared to the control. The grain Pb (-41% to -51%, with no significant differences among different treatments) and Ni (-63%) concentrations were also reduced significantly following BC treatments compared to control.

Element concentrates were determined by a portable X-ray fluorescence in situ and an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in the lab. Two sets of indexes, including geological accumulation index, contamination factor, and pollution load index, and hazard quotient and total carcinogenic risk were adopted to evaluate the pollution and health-risk of heavy metals. A scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to observe chromium occurrence and speciation. With an average of 6493.11 mg/kg, chromium contents in the lagoon soils reached up to 12971.19 mg/kg, 211-times higher than the threshold of Chinese soils (61.00 mg/kg). Elevated Cr contents resulted in significantly high pollution and noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks in the studied area. Chromium in most soils occurred predominately as Cr3+ (60-74%), and to a lesser extent, Cr6+. The mechanism responsible for decreasing Cr6+ percentages in soils with increasing depth was summarized: Cr6+ favors aqueous environment; soil moisture decreased with increasing depth; in soils especially in the lower portion, Cr6+ was reduced by Fe0 and Fe2, transforming into Cr3+ and Fe3+. In addition, the alkaline condition promoted Cr3+ to precipitate, resulting more Cr3+ absorbing in soils. The intimate association of Cr and Fe in soils (i. e. , Cr mainly occurred in Fe oxides and dolomite) further confirmed our assumptions. A combined application of microorganism (e. g. , Aeromonas hydrophila) and biochar (prepared from maize stalk or peanut shells) were recommended to alleviate Cr pollution in the soils."

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Fungal contamination of agricultural products poses a challenge to global food security. Mycotoxins, the toxigenic metabolites produced by some fungal species, are not completely destroyed by processing operations, and are carried over into processed food, through which they may cause harm to consumers. Routine tests on the mycological quality of consumer goods have therefore become pertinent. This study reports the isolation of live pathogenic fungi in commonly consumed food commodities, necessitating the need for regular routine checks to ensure the mycological safety of agricultural products offered for sale to consumers. As proliferation of these fungi is influenced by storage conditions, this study will also contribute to devising appropriate storage management techniques for these commodities."

This technology has gained rapid acceptance based on observations that activated carbon amendments predictably lower PCDD/F concentrations in water and bioaccumulation by simple aquatic organisms and earthworms; it has been assumed that bioavailability to mammals is similarly reduced, although this has been disproven for other sorbent materials. In the present study TCDD was absorbed to a microporous activated carbon (TCDD-AC) using the incipient wetness method. An aqueous suspension of TCDD-AC and an equivalent dosage of TCDD in corn oil were administered by oral gavage to B6C3F1 mice. The relative bioavailability of TCDD-AC was determined by quantifying and comparing the hepatic induction of cyp1A1 (messenger ribonucleic acid) and suppression of the immunoglobulin M antibody-forming cell immune response by the 2 forms of TCDD. A concentration-dependent response was observed for both assays when TCDD in corn oil was administered to mice. However, when equivalent masses of TCDD were administered as TCDD-AC, no induction of cyp1A1 or suppression of the immunoglobulin M antibody-forming cell response was observed. The absence of these 2 sensitive aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated responses in mice provides the first direct evidence that activated carbon can sequester TCDD in a form that eliminates its bioavailability to mammals. These results support the premise that activated carbon can be used to reduce the bioeffective dose of TCDD delivered to mammals and that activated carbon amendments may provide a low-cost alternative to traditional remediation technologies.

It has been addressed by the European Union with the Directives 2001/81/EC and 91/676/EEC to protect the environment and the human health. The disposal of manure has therefore become an economic and environmental challenge for farmers. Thus, the conversion of manure via anaerobic digestion in a biogas plant could be a sustainable solution, having the byproducts (solid and liquid digestates) the potential to be used as fertilizers for crops. This work aimed at characterizing and assessing the effect of digestates obtained from a local biogas plant (Biogas Wipptal, Gmbh), either in the form of liquid fraction or as a solid pellet on: (i) the fertility of the soils during an incubation experiment; (ii) the plant growth and nutritional status of different species (maize and cucumber). Moreover, an extensive characterization of the pellet was performed via X-ray microanalytical techniques. The data obtained showed that both digestates exhibit a fertilizing potential for crops, depending on the plant species and the fertilizer dose: the liquid fraction increases the shoot fresh weight at low dose in cucumber, conversely, the solid pellet increases the shoot fresh weight at high dose in maize. The liquid digestate may have the advantage to release nutrients (i. e. nitrogen) more rapidly to plants, but its storage represents the main constraint (i. e. ammonia volatilization). Indeed, pelleting the digestates could improve the storability of the fertilizer besides enhancing plant nutrient availability (i. e. phosphate and potassium), plant biomass and soil biochemical quality (i. e. microbial biomass and activity). The physical structure and chemical composition of pellet digestates allow nutrients to be easily mobilized over time, representing a possible source of mineral nutrients also in long-term applications."

After only 7 days of seedling growth, shoot biomass was decreased by all EDTA treatments compared with the zero-EDTA control. The amount of shoot biomass produced was highest with uncoated EDTA, intermediate with CCA, and lowest with the EDTA solution. Shoot Pb contents were highest with solid EDTA, intermediate with CCA, and lowest with EDTA solution, and they were always higher with EDTA treatments than in controls. In contrast, shoot Zn contents following EDTA treatments were lower than in the control. Levels of soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in aqueous soil extracts were much lower after CCA application than following treatments with solid EDTA and EDTA solution. After 17 days of plant growth, when most of the chelating agent had been released from the CCA, soil organic carbon levels remained relatively constant and similar to those in the control, indicating that a relatively low chelating agent concentration can be maintained for the plants to take up the metals. The distribution of Pb in the sequential extraction procedure showed that the Pb level in the exchangeable+carbonate-bound fraction with CCA was significantly lower than that with solid EDTA or EDTA solution, further indicating that slow release of CCA improves the bioavailability of metals in the soil to match plant uptake of those metals. The results suggest that CCA can enhance shoot content of Pb but not of Zn from the contaminated soil in the short term, and may also reduce the risk of metal leaching from the soil."

Therefore, knowledge concerning the nutritional and technological potential of non-traditional crops and their resistance to heat and drought is very interesting. Pearl millet is known to produce small nutritious cereal grains, which can endure both heat and dry conditions, and is one of the basic cereals of several African and Asian countries. Although this species has been cultivated in Brazil for at least 50 years it is only used as a cover crop and animal feed, but not for human consumption. Nonetheless, pearl millet grains have a high potential as food for humans because they are gluten-free, higher in dietary fiber content than rice, similar in lipid content to maize and higher content of essential amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and lysine) than other traditional cereals, such as wheat and rye. In addition, the crop is low cost and less susceptible to contamination by aflatoxins compared to corn, for example. Most grains, including pearl millet, can be milled, decorticated, germinated, fermented, cooked and extruded to obtain products such as flours, biscuits, snacks, pasta and non-dairy probiotic beverages. Pearl millet also has functional properties; it has a low glycemic index and therefore it can be used as an alternative food for weight control and to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as diabetes.

In particular, a potential hazard was identified for non-target lepidopteran larvae, if they consume Bt maize pollen on their host plants. Risk can be defined as a function of the effect of an event (hazard) and the likelihood of this event occurring. Although data on toxicity (hazard) are available from many lab and field studies, knowledge about the environmental exposure of European lepidopteran larvae is incomplete at the population level. Therefore we studied the distribution of small tortoiseshell caterpillars (Aglais urticae (L. )) and its host plant in an agricultural landscape in Germany, to estimate the potential population exposure to maize pollen. The results showed that larvae of the small tortoiseshell developed primarily on freshly sprouted nettle stands (Urtica dioica (L. )) in field margins, rather than adjacent to hedges and groves. However, the main distribution was at margins of cereal (non-maize) fields, where 70% of all larvae were found. This may be due the fact that cereals covered 54% of the survey area, while maize only covered 6.1%. On the other hand, maize fields seem so show higher food plant densities than cereal crops. The results must be interpreted carefully, as the data basis of the present study is very small, and the situation can vary between years due to crop rotation or other changes in agricultural practices. Therefore it is still questionable whether the small tortoiseshell is significantly exposed to maize pollen. For a conclusive risk assessment, more replications and surveys of larger areas in different intensively managed agricultural landscapes over several years are needed."

These indices maybe used for an evaluation before use of pesticides by farmers and advisers. The present approach was initially validated for herbicides in maize crops, but it can readily be applied to other PPPs and crops. PESTi index underline the physical and chemical characteristics as a whole, not considering the impact of other factors such as application rate or period of application. Hence, this index may underestimate the risk associated to a certain chemical. AGROi has a precautionary approach. The risk associated to a specific mixture derives from a combination of intrinsic characteristics of the chemicals, agronomic impacts, regulation restrictions and potential hazard to water compartment. The ECOi index is focused on the ecotoxicological impact against non-target organisms. The helpfulness of this index stands in its ability to easily discriminate the ecotoxicological impact of chemicals using indicators commonly available in literature and without making complex calculations. PRISW-1 Index discriminate active substances according to their risk against three representative non-target organisms. However, due to the intrinsic characteristics of each pesticide, a high PRISW-1 value could not always mean an easy movement of the chemical via runoff waters. The information deriving from Priority index may certainly help public authorities to select chemicals to be detected in water monitoring campaigns.

A field study was conducted on site, and exposure data from the literature were summarized to determine the matrices and exposure concentrations that nontarget species could typically experience within an agricultural ecosystem. To determine ecological effects on nontarget species, acute toxicity bioassays were conducted on earthworms (Eisenia fetida), amphipods (Hyalella azteca), and Elmid riffle beetle larvae (Ancyronyx spp. ) in which the test species were exposed to single insecticides as well as the mixture of the 3 insecticides. In the risk characterization section of the ERA, stressor-response profiles for each species tested were compared with field distributions of the insecticides, and a margin of safety at the 10th percentile (MOS10) was calculated to estimate risk. No acute toxicity was observed in any of the 3 nontarget species after exposure to senescent Bt corn leaf tissue. Large MOS10 values were calculated for clothianidin to the nontarget species. When bioassays were compared with tefluthrin field distributions, very low MOS10 values were calculated for earthworms (0.06) and H. azteca (0.08) because the environmental concentrations often exceeded the stressor-response profile. No increased toxicity was observed when nontarget species were exposed to a mixture of the 3 insecticides. In summary, the genetically modified corn insecticidal proteins and clothianidin were not found at environmental concentrations exceeding benchmark values for ecological effects, but tefluthrin was consistently detected in the environment at levels that could be causing toxicity to nontarget species, especially if this pyrethroid is able to travel off site."

In this study, a pot experiment was carried out, where Bidens pilosa L.

The mechanism of how biochars promoted B. pilosa Cd accumulation in Cd-contaminated farmland soil was explored. Results showed that the application of 5% wheat straw fine biochar (WF), wheat straw coarse biochar (WC), maize straw fine biochar (MF) and maize straw coarse biochar (MC) increased the total Cd accumulation of B. pilosa to 251.57%, 217.41%, 321.64% and 349.66%, respectively. Biochars amendment significantly promoted B. pilosa growth and increased Cd accumulation by improving soil physical properties, nutrient levels (available nitrogen, available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK) and organic matter (OM)) and microbial activity, and changing the nutrients distribution in B. pilosa organs although tissues although DTPA-Cd reduced to some extent. The effect of MF on AP increase was better than MC, while the effect of WF on AK increase was better than WC. Fine-particle was superior to coarse-particle in increasing B. pilosa biomass of aboveground, OM and microbial activity in soil. The changes of N, P and K concentrations in B. pilsosa roots, stems and leaves were closely related to the changes of AN, AP and AK in soil after biochars application.

The objectives of this study were to develop a 5' fluorogenic (Taqman) real-time PCR assay for group-specific detection of trichothecene- and fumonisin-producing Fusarium spp. and to identify Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium verticillioides in field-collected barley and corn samples. Primers and probes were designed from genes involved in mycotoxin biosynthesis (TRI6 and FUM1), and for a genus-specific internal positive control, primers and a probe were designed from Fusarium rDNA sequences. Real-time PCR conditions were optimized for amplification of the three products in a single reaction format. The specificity of the assay was confirmed by testing 9 Fusarium spp. and 33 non-Fusarium fungal species. With serial dilutions of purified genomic DNA from F. verticillioides, F. graminearum, or both as the template, the detection limit of the assay was 5 pg of genomic DNA per reaction. The three products were detectable over four orders of magnitude of template concentration (5 pg to 5 ng of genomic DNA per reaction); at 50 ng template per reaction, only the TRI6 and FUM1 PCR products were detected. Barley and corn samples were evaluated for the presence of Fusarium spp. with traditional microbiological methods and with the real-time PCR assay. The 20 barley samples and 1 corn sample that contained F. graminearum by traditional methods of analysis tested positive for the TRI6 and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) PCR products. The five corn samples that tested positive for F. verticillioides by traditional methods also were positive for the FUMI and ITS PCR products. These results indicate that the described multiplex real-time PCR assay provides sensitive and accurate differential detection of fumonisin- and trichothecene-producing groups of Fusarium spp. in complex matrices."

A validated microwave digestion/ICP-MS method was applied for determining the concentration of Cd. In this study, the concentration of Cd ranged 3.7-215.8 μg/kg fw in which carrot contained the lowest Cd while the fleshy prawn contained the highest Cd. There are no statistical differences of Cd content in microwave-cooked food and raw food except potato, lotus root, and eastern oyster. Cd in most of the cooked food materials was less bioaccessible than in raw food except sweet corn, potato, and kelp. The bioaccessibility of Cd was around 100 % in either raw or cooked potatoes. Microwave cooking caused the decreasing of bioaccessibility around 0-68 %, depending on different food matrix. Maximal decreasing of Cd bioaccessibility occurred in common carp. Thus, microwave cooking could be a feasible strategy for decreasing Cd bioaccessibility. In addition, the Cd dissolution in oral, gastric, and small intestine phase was different in different food matrix. For most of the investigated food items, Cd was largely migrated either into the oral phase (carrot, potato, white radish, lotus root, raw soybean, kelp, and common carp) or into the gastric phase (sweet corn, cooked soybean, rice, fleshy prawn, and eastern oyster).

Total geoavailable and bioaccessible concentrations in the gastric and intestinal phases were determined to evaluate lead availability and health risk. The soil was then washed with EDTA, and the geochemical fractionation (interchangeable, carbonates, Fe/Mn oxy-hydroxides, organic matter-sulfides, and residual) and impact on the mesophile bacteria and fungi/yeast populations were analyzed. The results showed total Pb concentrations up to 647 ± 3.50 mg/kg, a 46% bioaccessible fraction (297 ± 9.90 mg/kg) in the gastric phase and a 12.2% (80 ± 5 mg/kg) bioaccessible fraction in the intestinal phase, indicating a health and environmental risk. Meanwhile, the geochemical fractionation before washing showed a Pb fraction mainly consisting of Fe/Mn oxy-hydroxides (69.6%); this reducible fraction may progressively increase its bioaccessibility. Geochemical fractionation performed in the washed soil showed differences from that determined before the treatment; however, the iron and manganese fraction, at 42.4%, accounted for most of the Pb. The soil microbiology was also modified by EDTA, with an increase in aerobic bacteria and a decrease in fungi/yeast populations. Although 44% total lead removal was achieved, corresponding to a final concentration of 363.50 ± 43.50 mg/kg (below national and USEPA standards), washing with EDTA increased the soluble and interchangeable lead concentrations.

The European Commission (EC) has acted on this concern setting stricter standards for infants, 100 μg of inorganic arsenic per kg of food (100 μg/kg), as compared to adults (200 μg/kg), for rice based foods, a law that was brought into place in 1st January 2016. Here we investigate how this law has impacted on inorganic arsenic in baby food products in the UK market, and compare the findings to previous baby food surveys taken before and just after the law came into place. We find that for a wide range of UK infant products that the new regulations are being adhered to, with all samples surveyed, being under 100 μg/kg inorganic arsenic. The prevalence of pure rice products had decreased in the UK, and there appears to be careful sourcing of the rice used in these products to ensure conformity with regulations. There has been an increased presence of mixed cereal products, with rice and maize as the main ingredient, appearing on the UK market, with varying rice contents for infant porridges, cakes and mueslis, with the latter being a relatively innovative product for infant foods. There was a highly significant correlation (P<0.0001) between rice content and inorganic arsenic concentration across all infant foods. When UK infant rice cakes, breakfast cereals and porridges were compare to their general, i. e. not labelled specifically for being for infant consumption, equivalent it was found that the adult foods generally exceeded the 100 μg/kg inorganic arsenic standard for infant foods. Thus, infants should not be given rice products not specifically labelled as being for them if a lower inorganic arsenic diet is to be maintained."

Concentrations of neonicotinoids were higher in early spring, indicating that emission and drifting of contaminated dust during sowing raises contamination levels of puddles. Although the overall average acute risk of drinking water from puddles was relatively low, concentrations of neonicotinoids ranged from 0.01 to 63 µg/L and were sufficient to potentially elicit a wide array of sublethal effects in individuals and colony alike. Our results also suggest that risk assessment of honey bee water resources underestimates the foragers' exposure and consequently miscalculates the risk. In fact, our data shows that honey bees and native pollinators are facing unprecedented cumulative exposure to these insecticides from combined residues in pollen, nectar and water. These findings not only document the impact of this route of exposure for honey bees, they also have implications for the cultivation of a wide variety of crops for which the extensive use of neonicotinoids is currently promoted."

Department of Agriculture-Food Safety and Inspection Service. Cattle are the primary reservoir of these human pathogens. In this study, 59 Angus crossbred heifers were tested specifically for these seven STEC serogroups using a combination of standard culture, serological, PCR, and cell cytotoxicity methods to determine if comparable results would be obtained. At the time of fecal sampling, the animals were approximately 2 years old and weighed 1000-1200 lbs. The diet comprised of 37% ground alfalfa hay, 25% ground Sudan hay, and 38% ground corn supplemented with trace minerals and rumensin with ad libitum access to water. Non-O157 STEC were isolated from 25% (15/59) of the animals tested using a combination of EC broth, CHROMagar STECTM, and Rainbow Agar O157. Interestingly, the O157 serogroup was not isolated from any of the animals. Non-O157 STEC isolates were confirmed to be one of the six adulterant serogroups by serology and/or colony PCR in 10/15 animals with the predominant viable, serogroup being O103. PCR using DNA extracted from feces verified most of the colony PCR results but also identified additional virulence and O-antigen genes from samples with no correlating culture results. Shiga toxin- (Stx-) related cytopathic effects on Vero cells with fecal extracts from 55/59 animals could only be associated with the Stx gene profiles obtained by fecal DNA PCR and not culture results. The differences between culture versus fecal DNA PCR and cytotoxicity assay results suggest that the latter two assays reflect the presence of nonviable STEC or infection with STEC not belonging to the seven adulterant serogroups. This study further supports the use of combinatorial culture, serology, and PCR methods to isolate viable STEC that pose a greater food safety threat."

This study examined variation in toxicity of the herbicide atrazine to a representative green algal species Raphidocelis subcapitata (formerly Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) with changes in light intensity, water temperature, concentrations of nutrients or combinations of these three parameters. Conditions were chosen that could be representative of the intensive corn growing Midwestern region of the United States of America where atrazine is used extensively. Varying light intensity (4-58µmol/m(2)s) resulted in no observable trend in 96-h EC50 values for growth rate. EC50 values for PSII yield generally increased with decreasing light intensity but not significantly in all cases. The 96-h EC50 values for growth rate decreased with decreases in temperature (20-5°C) from standard conditions (25°C), but EC50 values for PSII yield at lower temperatures were not significantly different from standard conditions. Finally, there was no clear trend in 96-h EC50 values for both endpoints with increases in nitrogen (4.1-20mg/L) and phosphorus (0.24-1.2mg/L). The 96-h EC50 values for both endpoints under combinations of conditions mimicking aquatic systems in the Midwestern U.

This combination of decreased light intensity and temperature and increased nutrients relative to standard conditions does not appear to significantly affect the observed toxicity of atrazine to R. subcapitata.

The current study investigates the effect of dry milling on the reduction of fumonisins (FB), deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA) in maize. Five composite samples, constructed to represent different mycotoxin contamination levels were degermed yielding degermed maize and the germ. The degermed maize was milled under laboratory conditions and four major milling fractions (SPECIAL, SUPER, semolina (SEM) and milling hominy feed) collected. The whole maize, degermed maize and total hominy feed (germ+milling hominy feed) were reconstructed to ensure homogenous samples for mycotoxin analyses. For comparison, commercial dry milling fractions (whole maize, SPECIAL, SUPER and total hominy feed), collected from three South African industrial mills, were analysed for the same mycotoxins and hence a more accurate assessment of the distribution between the different milling fractions. The distribution of the mycotoxins during the experimental dry milling of the degermed maize differs, with FB mainly concentrated in the SPECIAL, DON in the SEM whereas ZEA was equally distributed between the two milling fractions. Distribution of mycotoxins between the fractions obtained during commercial dry milling generally provided similar results with the total hominy feed containing the highest and the SUPER milling fractions the lowest mycotoxin levels although variations existed. Although milling is an effective way to reduce mycotoxins in maize, kernel characteristics and resultant fungal colonisation may impact on the distribution of specific mycotoxins among the different milling fractions. Differences in industrial dry milling practices and problems encountered in sampling bulk maize remain a large problem in assessing mycotoxin contamination in milling fractions intended for human consumption."

Forecasting Fusarium infection and fumonisin synthesis could allow operators in the field to control contamination during the growing season and to make the best agronomic decisions for high quality yields while respecting the limits imposed by the European Union. A research project to develop a decision support system for the control of field-phase fumonisin contamination began in Italy in 2003. This paper presents a preliminary version of the engine of the decision support tool: FUMAgrain, a dynamic risk assessment model developed with data from the north of Italy. The structure of FUMAgrain is based on the pathosystem formed by maize, F. verticillioides and Ostrinia nubilalis (European Corn Borer). The elements of the pathosystem are simulated by three sub-models: (i) maize development, (ii) F. verticillioides infection and fumonisin synthesis, (iii) European Corn Borer wounding activity on maize grain. Inputs to the model are (i) planting date, (ii) hourly meteorological data including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and rain intensity, (iii) information on the phenological development of the hybrid planted (flowering and dry-down), and (iv) information about the chemical treatment against European Corn Borer. FUMAgrain gives an initial risk alert at the end of flowering based on the meteorological conditions during this phase. A second alert follows maturation when an assessment is made from (i) maize grain moisture, (ii) European Corn Borer damage to the ear, and (iii) fumonisin synthesis risk. Following calibration and validation with data FUMAgrain demonstrated its good capability to simulate fumonisin synthesis in maize grain in Italy (calibration: R^2=0.70; validation: R^2=0.71) and its usefulness for determining the optimal harvest date while respecting grain safety levels required by the international market and limiting moisture content, hence drying costs."

The experimental rats were divided into five groups. The rats of the first group were served as control. The experimental animals of the second group were exposed to diazinon (DZN). The animals of the third group were supplemented with grapeseed oil and treated with DZN. The rats of the fourth group were supplemented with grapeseed oil. The experimental rats of the fifth group were supplemented with corn oil. Hematobiochemical and histopathological evaluations were chosen as indicators of DZN toxicity and protective role of grapeseed oil. In rats exposed only to DZN, the levels of serum glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, creatinine, urea nitrogen, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were statistically increased, while the level of serum total protein was significantly decreased. Moreover, the histopathological evaluations of the liver, kidney and testis showed that DZN causes several severe alterations. Pretreatment with grapeseed oil exhibited a protective role against DZN toxicity which confirmed by the inhibition of hematobiochemical and histopathological changes due to DZN exposure.

In addition, the BAFs for PFAAs in greenhouse lettuce decreased approximately 0.3 log units per CF2 group. A limited-scale field study was conducted to verify greenhouse findings. The greatest accumulation was seen for PFBA and PFPeA in both field-grown lettuce and tomato; BAFs for PFBA were highest in both crops. PFAA levels measured in lettuce and tomato grown in field soil amended with only a single application of biosolids (at an agronomic rate for nitrogen) were predominantly below the limit of quantitation (LOQ).

Without a workable framework for conducting the ecological risk assessment (ERA) and a standardized ERA protocol, however, the utility of RNAi transgenic crops in pest management remains uncertain. The overall goal of this study is to assess the risks of RNAi-based GE crops on a non-target soil micro-arthropod, Sinella curviseta, which could be exposed to plant-protected dsRNAs deposited in crop residues. Based on the preliminary research, we hypothesized that insecticidal dsRNAs targeting at the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, a billion-dollar insect pest, has no adverse impacts on S. curviseta, a soil decomposer. Following a tiered approach, we tested this risk hypothesis using a well-designed dietary RNAi toxicity assay. To create the worst-case scenario, the full-length cDNA of v-ATPase subunit A from S. curviseta were cloned and a 400 bp fragment representing the highest sequence similarity between target pest and non-target arthropods was selected as the template to synthesize insecticidal dsRNAs. Specifically, 10-days-old S. curviseta larvae were subjected to artificial diets containing v-ATPase A dsRNAs from both D. v. virgifera (dsDVV) and S. curviseta (dsSC), respectively, a dsRNA control, β-glucuronidase, from plant (dsGUS), and a vehicle control, H2O. The endpoint measurements included gene expression profiles, survival, and life history traits, such as developmental time, fecundity, hatching rate, and body length. Although, S. curviseta larvae developed significantly faster under the treatments of dsDVV and dsSC than the vehicle control, the combined results from both temporal RNAi effect study and dietary RNAi toxicity assay support the risk hypothesis, suggesting that the impacts of ingested arthropod-active dsRNAs on this representative soil decomposer are negligible."

We studied the concentrations, migration, sources, and health risks through consumption of two main crops (corn and rice), six kinds of vegetables, and medicinal plants (Fengdan, Paeonia ostii) for six metal elements (Cu, Zn, Cr, Cd, Pb and Hg). Results revealed Cr and Cd in soils, and Cd, Cr, Pb, Cu and Zn in dustfall showed a relatively high contamination degree. The mean contents of Cr and Pb in corn kernels, as well as Cd, Cr and Pb in rice grains and all vegetables, and Cr in Fengdan cortex moutan exceeded the corresponding food safety limits in China. The transfer capability of Cr in corn kernels and rice grains, Pb in edible vegetables, and Cd in cortex moutan were the strongest, respectively. Health risk assessment results showed Cr had the greatest non-carcinogenic risk, followed by Pb and Cd. The results of pearson's correlation analysis (CA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and principal component analysis (PCA) indicated Zn-Cr, Pb and Cd-Cu-Hg in the plants might derive from different geochemical end-members. Source apportionment based on lead isotope showed that mining-smelting activities were the major source of Pb in atmospheric dustfall and agricultural soils, with the average contribution rates of 66% and 50%, respectively. Vehicle emissions from diesel fuels (50%-68%) and mining-smelting activities (16%-25%) contributed mainly to Pb accumulation in plants. Hence, our study suggested the accumulations of Pb in plants might be mainly from the direct foliar uptake of atmospheric Pb related to vehicle emissions and mining-smelting activities."

Principles of ecological risk assessment provide a means for assessing non-target risks when information regarding exposure to the toxin and species-specific effects are lacking. This is shown for the case of Bt Cry1F maize release in Japan, where off-field pollen dissemination and effect on butterfly species is of concern. The specific ecological entity of concern for the assessment of the non-target impact of Cry1F maize pollen was Yamato-shijimi (pale grass blue butterfly), Pseudozizeeria maha (Kollar), a commonly occurring, susceptible species. Yamato-shijimi is widely adapted in Japan where it occurs in both rural and metropolitan settings, corresponding to the distribution and habitat of katabami (Oxalis corniculata (L. )), the larval host plant. The northern extent of Yamato-shijimi habitat lies to the south of major maize production regions in Japan, but exposure may occur elsewhere where maize and Yamato-shijimi co-occur. Screening level assessment of potential adverse effects to Yamato-shijimi in the field environment considered the probability for spatial-temporal co-occurrence of the life stages of concern (1st and 2nd instars) and the stressor (Cry1F protein expressed in maize pollen) at environmentally relevant concentrations. In the event of exposure to maize pollen, early instars of Yamato-shijimi feed exclusively on the underside of katabami leaves, which further limits the portion of the butterfly population that would be exposed. Projected levels of exposure to Cry1F pollen are below the toxicity level of concern and, thus, indicate negligible risk. Most sensitive species characterization (intergenera sensitivity) similarly shows negligible risk to other Japanese butterfly species of concern when distributed beyond the maize field or field margin."

According to information from agricultural cooperatives of the Mondego valley (Figueira da Foz, Portugal), Primextra(®) Gold TZ is the most used herbicide in corn crop fields and one of the 20 best-selling herbicides in Portugal. Copper is mainly used in pesticide formulations. This study aims to determine the ecotoxicological and biochemical (namely fatty acid profiles) effects of the herbicide Primextra(®) Gold TZ and the metal copper on marine plankton. The organisms used in this study are three planktonic species: the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii, the estuarine copepod Acartia tonsa and nauplii of the marine brine shrimp Artemia franciscana. Fatty acids (FAs) are one of the most important molecules transferred across the plant-animal interface in aquatic food webs and can be used as good indicators of stress. The conducted lab incubations show that T. weissflogii is the most sensitive species to the herbicide followed by A. tonsa (EC50=0.0078mg/L and EC50=0.925mg/L, respectively), whereas the copepod was the most sensitive species to the metal followed by T. weissflogii (EC50=0.234mg/L and EC50=0.383mg/L, respectively). A. franciscana was the most tolerant organism both to the herbicide and to the metal (EC50=20.35mg/L and EC50=18.93mg/L, respectively). Changes in the FA profiles of primary producer and primary consumers were observed, with the increase of saturated FA and decrease of unsaturated FA contents, especially of highly unsaturated FAs that can be obtained mainly from food and therefore are referred to as 'essential FA'. The study suggests that discharges of Primextra(®) Gold TZ or other pesticides mainly composed by copper may be a threat to plankton populations causing changes in the FA contents and thus in their nutritive value, with severe repercussions for higher trophic levels and thus the entire food web."

Nisin-treated samples were most effective against L. monocytogenes in both PVC and vacuum-packaged fillets, with a total reduction of 3.5 log and 3.7 log, respectively over the length of the storage time. LG-treated samples reduced L. monocytogenes cell counts by 2.5 log in PVC and 1.7 log in vacuum-packaged samples. Only LG-treated samples packaged in PVC were found to inhibit the growth of spoilage organisms.

During the ignition phase, BC emissions were found to be low, while the later addition of fuel dramatically increased emissions, followed by a gradual decrease until the next fuel addition. The phased results show that the flaming phase had the highest BC emission rate, the fuel addition phase was associated with the highest BC EF. The BC emission rates and EFs for the ignition, fuel addition, flaming and smoldering phases ranged from 0.0014-0.014, 0.11-6.32, 0.18-2.24 and 0.03-0.32 mg s-1, and from 0.04-0.18, 0.38-9.53, 0.45-3.55 and 0.12-1.01 g kg-1, respectively.

The field trials involved four maize lines with contrasting levels of resistance to Aspergillus flavus. The resistant lines had 7 to 14-fold greater infested ears than the susceptible lines. Seed aflatoxin B1 (AF) levels, in mock- and A. flavus-inoculated ears were consistent with genotype resistance to A. flavus, in that the resistant lines showed low levels of AF (<30 ppb), whereas the susceptible lines had up to 500 ppb. On the other hand, CEW infestation showed a positive correlation with seed fumonisins (FUM) contamination by native Fusarium verticillioides strains. We inferred that the inverse trend in the correlation of AF and FUM with H. zea infestation may be due to a differential sensitivity of CEW to the two mycotoxins. This hypothesis was tested by toxin-feeding studies. H. zea larvae showed decreasing mass with increasing AF in the diet and incurred >30% lethality at 250 ppb. In contrast, CEW was tolerant to fumonisin with no significant loss in larval mass even at 100 ppm, implicating the low seed aflatoxin content as a predominant factor for the prevalence of CEW infestation and the associated fumonisin contamination in A. flavus resistant maize lines. Further, delayed flowering of the two resistant maize lines might have contributed to the pervasive H. zea damage of these lines by providing young silk for egg-laying. These results highlight the need for integrated strategies targeting mycotoxigenic fungi as well as their insect vectors for enhanced food safety."

The objectives of this paper were to review these studies, discuss their limitations and uncertainties and identify the most critical chemicals that may pose a health risk to Brazilian consumers. The studies have shown that the cumulative intake of organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides by high consumers of fruits and vegetables may represent a health concern (up to 169% of the ARfD), although the benefits of consuming large portions of those foods most probably overcome the risks. High consumers of maize products may also be at risk due to the presence of fumonisin (355% of the PMTDI), a mycotoxin present at high levels in Brazilian maize. The studies conducted in the Brazilian Amazon have shown that riparian fish consumers are exposed to unsafe levels of mercury. However, this is a more complex issue, as mercury levels in the region are naturally high and the health benefits of a fish-based diet are well known. Studies conducted both in Brazil and internationally on acrylamide have shown that the exposure to this genotoxic compound, mainly from the consumption of French fries and potato chips, is of health concern. Reducing the population dietary exposure to toxic chemicals is a challenge for government authorities and food producers in all countries. Management strategies aimed at decreasing exposure to the critical chemicals identified in this review involve limiting the use or eliminating highly toxic pesticides, implementing good agricultural practices to decrease maize contamination by fumonisins, educating local fish-eating communities toward a fish diet less contaminated by mercury, and changing dietary habits concerning the consumption of fried potatoes, the main processed food containing acrylamide."

Quantitative modelling was applied, considering both direct effects of changing climate on toxin contamination and indirect effects via shifts in crop phenology. Climate change projections for the IPCC A1B emission scenario were used for the scenario period 2031-2050 relative to the baseline period of 1975-1994. Climatic data from two different global and regional climate model combinations were used. A weather generator was applied for downscaling climate data to local conditions. Crop phenology models and prediction models for DON contamination used, each for winter wheat and grain maize. Results showed that flowering and full maturity of both wheat and maize will advance with future climate. Flowering advanced on average 5 and 11 days for wheat, and 7 and 14 days for maize (two climate model combinations). Full maturity was on average 10 and 17 days earlier for wheat, and 19 and 36 days earlier for maize. On the country level, contamination of wheat with deoxynivalenol decreased slightly, but not significantly. Variability between regions was large, and individual regions showed a significant increase in deoxynivalenol concentrations. For maize, an overall decrease in deoxynivalenol contamination was projected, which was significant for one climate model combination, but not significant for the other one. In general, results disagree with previous reported expectations of increased feed and food safety hazards under climate change.

With the widespread use of pesticides in crop production, and the frequent detection of these chemicals in groundwater, large-scale risk assessments would help water resource managers to identify areas that are more susceptible to contamination and implement practices to ameliorate the problem. This paper presents an integrated, visual and interactive system for predicting potential environmental risks associated with pesticide contamination at spatial scales ranging from fields to landscapes and regions. The interactive system extends the predictive ability of the Pesticide Root Zone Model Release 2.0 (PRZM-2) to a landscape and statewide scale through integration with a geographic information system (GIS), graphical user interface and environmental databases. Predictions of statewide (Iowa) vulnerability of groundwater from atrazine leaching below the unsaturated zone were made to demonstrate the utility of the system, and the results were used in risk assessment. In the example application, atrazine fate and transport were evaluated using long-term climatic data (1980--1989) in combination with several environmental databases (eg STATSGO soils database) and exposure risks were expressed in terms of the probability of the predicted pesticide concentrations exceeding the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for drinking water. The results indicate that the predicted pesticide concentrations were significantly lower than the EPA-established MCL. In addition to providing an interactive environment for landscape-level assessment of potential risks from pesticide leaching, the system significantly reduces the time and resources needed to organize and manipulate data for use with PRZM-2, and provides an analytical framework for evaluating groundwater-leaching impacts of pesticide management practices."

The uptake rate constants (k(s)) for each PFC to larvae differed with different CM amendments (p < 0.05), while elimination rate did not change significantly (p > 0.05). Decreasing PFC concentration in larvae (C(B)) was found with increasing CM concentration (f(CM)) in the sediments, and a linear positive correlation existed between 1/C(B) and f(CM) (p < 0.05). The effect of CMs on PFC bioaccumulation agreed well with the CM properties; MWCNT10 with the highest specific surface area resulted in the lowest k(s) values and biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAF), with a BSAF reduction of 66%-97% by a 1.5% amendment. The mechanism was explored by analyzing the aqueous phase concentrations of PFCs and the sorption of PFCs on sediments amended with CMs. The results suggested that the decreasing trend of PFCs in larvae was caused by the decreasing aqueous phase concentration with increasing CM concentration. In the studied conditions with low PFC concentrations, the bioaccumulation of PFCs was a linear partitioning between pore water and biota, and the sorption of PFCs to the sediment/CM mixtures was a two domain linear distribution. This study suggests that both the type and concentration of carbonaceous materials in sediment can affect the bioaccumulation of PFCs to benthic organisms through changing their aqueous phase concentrations."

The role of PAs in plant disease resistance depends on the relative abundance of higher PAs [spermidine (Spd), spermine (Spm)] vs. the diamine putrescine (Put) and PA catabolism. With respect to the pathogen, PAs are required to achieve successful pathogenesis of the host. Maize is an important food and feed crop, which is highly susceptible to Aspergillus flavus infection. Upon infection, the fungus produces carcinogenic aflatoxins and numerous other toxic secondary metabolites that adversely affect human health and crop value worldwide. To evaluate the role of PAs in aflatoxin resistance in maize, in vitro kernel infection assays were performed using maize lines that are susceptible (SC212) or resistant (TZAR102, MI82) to aflatoxin production. Results indicated significant induction of both PA biosynthetic and catabolic genes upon A. flavus infection. As compared to the susceptible line, the resistant maize lines showed higher basal expression of PA metabolism genes in mock-inoculated kernels that increased upon fungal infection. In general, increased biosynthesis and conversion of Put to Spd and Spm along with their increased catabolism was evident in the resistant lines vs. the susceptible line SC212. There were higher concentrations of amino acids such as glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in SC212. The resistant lines were significantly lower in fungal load and aflatoxin production as compared to the susceptible line. The data presented here demonstrate an important role of PA metabolism in the resistance of maize to A. flavus colonization and aflatoxin contamination. These results provide future direction for the manipulation of PA metabolism in susceptible maize genotypes to improve aflatoxin resistance and overall stress tolerance."

Fumonisin B1 (FB 1), FB 2 and FB 3 are the most common forms of fumonisins in feedstuffs and thus were included in the assessment. FB 1, FB 2 and FB 3 have the same mode of action and were considered as having similar toxicological profile and potencies. For fumonisins, the EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) identified no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) for cattle, pig, poultry (chicken, ducks and turkeys), horse, and lowest-observed-adverse-effect levels (LOAELs) for fish (extrapolated from carp) and rabbits. No reference points could be identified for sheep, goats, dogs, cats and mink. The dietary exposure was estimated on 18,140 feed samples on FB 1-3 representing most of the feed commodities with potential presence of fumonisins. Samples were collected between 2003 and 2016 from 19 different European countries, but most of them from four Member States. To take into account the possible occurrence of hidden forms, an additional factor of 1.6, derived from the literature, was applied to the occurrence data. Modified forms of fumonisins, for which no data were identified concerning both the occurrence and the toxicity, were not included in the assessment. Based on mean exposure estimates, the risk of adverse health effects of feeds containing FB 1-3 was considered very low for ruminants, low for poultry, horse, rabbits, fish and of potential concern for pigs.

In this study, phytoextraction with a local economic crop (corn) that allows simultaneous Cd contamination reduction and corn biomass utilization is proposed. Biosurfactants, rhamnolipid (RL) and saponin (SP), were introduced to enhance Cd phytoextraction. The optimum RL and SP dose was 4 mmol kg-1. Cd uptake and corn biomass were higher with biosurfactant addition than in the control (without biosurfactants addition), by 2.7 and 2.3-fold, respectively, on the 30th day of corn plantation. The optimum biosurfactant doses were applied to phytoextraction experiments with corn at different corn growth stages (7th, 45th, and 80th day). The highest Cd uptake levels were recorded on day 45, and the maximum uptake was achieved with RL addition (39.06 mg Cd kg-1). These results were confirmed by bioaccumulation factors, which indicated that RL enhanced soil Cd uptake by corn plants to the highest extent. However, Cd concentration in corn kernels from RL-assisted phytoextraction exceeded the standards for animal feed. On the other hand, although Cd uptake by corn plants in the presence of SP was lower, Cd content in the resulting corn kernels were within the allowable standard limit for animal feedstock. Moreover, compared to RL and control treatments, SP treatment resulted in higher Cd levels in the shoot than in the root, as confirmed by translocation factors. Meanwhile, SP could significantly promote soil Cd removal efficiency; Cd removal efficiencies on day 80 were in the order of SP (18.80%) > RL (11.33%) > control (4.59%). In addition, Cd leaching after addition of RL and SP was investigated. The two surfactants caused much lower Cd leaching from soil than ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).

This study was therefore initiated to assess the level of aflatoxin contamination of various foodstuffs sold in urban and semi-urban markets in Burkina Faso, and to evaluate the carcinogenic risk which the consuming population is exposed to. Two hundred and twelve foodstuff samples were collected in two large cities (Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso) and three semi urban localities (Cinkansé, Dakola and Niangoloko). Aflatoxins contents in foodstuffs were determined by immunoaffinity chromatography and human health risk assessment was performed by using the Monte Carlo algorithm. The aflatoxins contents determination showed that 41.50% of studied samples were contaminated with concentrations up to 182.28 μg/kg for AFB1 in peanuts. Chronic Daily Intake, calculated based on the consumption patterns assumed in this study, was estimated to be higher in large cities (CDI = 33.68 μg/kg bw in Ouagadougou and 10.18 μg/kg bw in Bobo Dioulasso) than in semi urban localities (CDI = 4.29 μg/kg bw in Cinkansé, CDI = 0.39 μg/kg bw in Dakola and CDI = 0.18 μg/kg bw in Niangoloko). The MOE determination showed that the sorghum meal and whole grain maize consumption was associated to the carcinogenic risk for public health in large cities (the percentile 95 of MOE = 3316 for rice, 4511 for peanuts, 3334 for sorghum meal and 4530 for whole grain maize). In semi urban localities, no carcinogenic risk was observed to public health. These results should inspire the country's sanitary and agricultural authorities to undertake actions to fight against the agricultural food products contamination by aflatoxins in order to safeguard the population's health."

Maize and three small grain cereals (sorghum, pearl millet, and finger millet) produced by smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe during 2016 and 2017 were examined for fungal community structure, and total aflatoxin (AF) and fumonisin (FM) content. A total of 800 maize and 180 small grain samples were collected at harvest and during storage from four agroecological zones. Fusarium spp. dominated the fungi associated with maize. Across crops, Aspergillusflavus constituted the main Aspergillus spp. Small grain cereals were less susceptible to both AF and FM. AF (52%) and FM (89%) prevalence was higher in maize than in small grains (13-25% for AF and 0-32% for FM). Less than 2% of small grain samples exceeded the EU regulatory limit for AF (4 µg/kg), while <10% exceeded the EU regulatory limit for FM (1000 µg/kg). For maize, 28% and 54% of samples exceeded AF and FM Codex guidance limits, respectively. Higher AF contamination occurred in the drier and hotter areas while more FM occurred in the wetter year. AF exposure risk assessment revealed that small grain consumption posed low health risks (≤0.02 liver cancer cases/100,000 persons/year) while maize consumption potentially caused higher liver cancer rates of up to 9.2 cases/100,000 persons/year depending on the locality. Additionally, FM hazard quotients from maize consumption among children and adults were high in both years, but more so in a wet year than a dry year. Adoption of AF and FM management practices throughout the maize value chain coupled with policies supporting dietary diversification are needed to protect maize consumers in Zimbabwe from AF- and FM-associated health effects. The higher risk of health burden from diseases associated with elevated concentration of mycotoxins in preferred maize during climate change events can be relieved by increased consumption of small grains."

Mycotoxins also induce mutagenic and carcinogenic effects after long exposure. Among mycotoxins that contaminate food are aflatoxins (AF) such as AFB1, which is the most powerful natural carcinogen. The AF poisoning results in symptoms of depression, anorexia, diarrhea, jaundice or anemia that can lead to death, but very few studies have explored the impact of AF on neuroendocrine regulations. To better understand the neurotoxic effects of AF related to anorexia, we explored in rat the impact of AFB1 on the major hypothalamic neuropeptides regulating feeding behavior, either orexigenic (NPY, Orexin, AgRP, MCH) or anorexigenic (α-MSH, CART, TRH). We also studied the effect of AFB1 on a novel neuropeptide, the secretogranin II (SgII)-derived peptide EM66, which has recently been linked to the control of food intake. For this, adult male rats were orally treated twice a week for 5 weeks with a low dose (150 μg/kg) or a high dose (300 μg/kg) of AFB1 dissolved in corn oil. Repeated exposure to AFB1 resulted in reduced body weight gain, which was highly significant for the high dose of AF. Immunocytochemical and quantitative PCR experiments revealed a dose-related decrease in the expression of all the hypothalamic neuropeptides studied in response to AFB1. Such orexigenic and anorexigenic alterations may underlie appetite disorders as they are correlated to a dose-dependent decrease in body weight gain of treated rats as compared to controls. We also found a decrease in the number of EM66-containing neurons in the arcuate nucleus of AFB1-treated animals, which was associated with a lower expression of its precursor SgII. These findings show for the first time that repeated consumption of AFB1 disrupts the hypothalamic regulation of neuropeptides involved in feeding behavior, which may contribute to the lower body weight gain associated to AF exposure."

Soils added with hay, maize straw or peat at 1% w/w were irrigated, at field capacity (FC) or saturated (S), with an aqueous solution of the anionic surfactant Aerosol 22 (A22), corresponding to an addition of 200 mgC/kgsoil/day.

Metal mobility increased for all treatments and soils (Pb>Cu>Cd≥Zn) compared to control assays. The increase was significantly correlated (p<0.05) with soil organic matter solubilisation for Cd (R=0.68), Cu (R=0.73) and Zn (R=0.86). Otherwise, Pb release was related to aluminium solubilisation (R=0.75), which suggests that Pb was originally co-precipitated with Al-DOC complexes in the solid phase. The effect of A22 in metal bioavailability, determined as free ion activities (FIA), was mainly controlled by soil moisture regime. For soil 3, metal bioavailability was up to 20 times lower for soil amended with hay, peat or maize compared to soil treated only with A22.

Model outputs for atrazine, bromoxynil, glyphosate, metolachlor, pendimethalin, sethoxydim, triflualin, and 2,4-D model output were used to predict the possible long-term implications that large-scale bioenergy crop expansion may have on the bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and humans. Threshold toxicity levels were obtained for the bluegill and for human consumption for all pesticides being evaluated through an extensive literature review. Model output was compared to each toxicity level for the suggested exposure time (96-hour for bluegill and 24-hour for humans). The results suggest that traditional intensive row crops such as canola, corn and sorghum may negatively impact aquatic life, and in most cases affect the safe drinking water availability. The continuous corn rotation, the most representative rotation for current agricultural practices for a starch-based ethanol economy, delivers the highest concentrations of glyphosate to the stream. In addition, continuous canola contributed to a concentration of 1.11 ppm of trifluralin, a highly toxic herbicide, which is 8.7 times the 96-hour ecotoxicity of bluegills and 21 times the safe drinking water level. Also during the period of study, continuous corn resulted in the impairment of 541,152 km of stream.

These results have clearly demonstrated how evaluations based on extractable metal concentrations may underestimate the risks of contaminated soils. Lettuce was the most sensitive species probably due to the great ability of this species in accumulating high concentrations of metals in their aboveground tissues. The highest bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) values were recorded for this species namely for Co (16.5), Cu (28.5), Ba (7.3), Sr (7.2) and Ni (6.1). Copper (9.0) and nickel (3.6) were the main elements bioaccumulated by maize. The dilution of mine soils with a local reference soil has proved to mitigate its toxicity in almost all the sites analysed."

However, the efficacy of transgenic Bt crops is put at risk by the adaptive resistance evolution of target pests. Previous studies indicate that resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1A and Cry1F toxins was genetically linked with mutations of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter subfamily C gene ABCC2 in at least seven lepidopteran insects. Several strains selected in the laboratory of the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis, a destructive pest of corn in Asian Western Pacific countries, developed high levels of resistance to Cry1A and Cry1F toxins. The causality between the O. furnacalisABCC2 (OfABCC2) gene and resistance to Cry1A and Cry1F toxins remains unknown. Here, we successfully generated a homozygous strain (OfC2-KO) of O. furnacalis with an 8-bp deletion mutation of ABCC2 by the CRISPR/Cas9 approach. The 8-bp deletion mutation results in a frame shift in the open reading frame of transcripts, which produced a predicted protein truncated in the TM4-TM5 loop region. The knockout strain OfC2-KO showed much more than a 300-fold resistance to Cry1Fa, and low levels of resistance to Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac (<10-fold), but no significant effects on the toxicities of Cry1Aa and two chemical insecticides (abamectin and chlorantraniliprole), compared to the background NJ-S strain. Furthermore, we found that the Cry1Fa resistance was autosomal, recessive, and significantly linked with the 8-bp deletion mutation of OfABCC2 in the OfC2-KO strain. In conclusion, in vivo functional investigation demonstrates the causality of the OfABCC2 truncating mutation with high-level resistance to the Cry1Fa toxin in O. furnacalis. Our results suggest that the OfABCC2 protein might be a functional receptor for Cry1Fa and reinforces the association of this gene to the mode of action of the Cry1Fa toxin."

Metals levels in water and soil samples were within the permissible limits except Cd in low-quality water samples. Levels of Pb in maize grains irrigated by low-quality water were above the permissible limits (0.20 mg kg-1), while Cd levels were within the permissible limits (0.1 mg kg-1) except Al-Nasiria samples. Levels of Pb and Cd in maize grains irrigated by low-quality water were 19-30 folds those of maize grains irrigated by freshwater. The risk assessment of Pb and Cd levels in maize grains was estimated by daily intake of metals (DIM) and health risk index (HRI).

In the case of genetically modified crops or crops treated with systemic pesticides, these materials may contain insecticidal Bt toxins or pesticides that potentially affect aquatic life. However, the particular exposure pattern of aquatic ecosystems (i. e. , via plant material) is not properly reflected in current risk assessment schemes, which primarily focus on waterborne toxicity and not on plant material as the route of uptake. To assist in risk assessment, the present study proposes a prioritization procedure of stream types based on the freshwater network and crop-specific cultivation data using maize in Germany as a model system. To identify stream types with a high probability of receiving crop materials, we developed a formalized, criteria-based and thus transparent procedure that considers the exposure-related parameters, ecological status--an estimate of the diversity and potential vulnerability of local communities towards anthropogenic stress--and availability of uncontaminated reference sections. By applying the procedure to maize, ten stream types out of 38 are expected to be the most relevant if the ecological effects from plant-incorporated pesticides need to be evaluated. This information is an important first step to identifying habitats within these stream types with a high probability of receiving crop plant material at a more local scale, including accumulation areas. Moreover, the prioritization procedure developed in the present study may support the selection of aquatic species for ecotoxicological testing based on their probability of occurrence in stream types having a higher chance of exposure. Finally, this procedure can be adapted to any geographical region or crop of interest and is, therefore, a valuable tool for a site-specific risk assessment of crop plants carrying systemic pesticides or novel proteins, such as insecticidal Bt toxins, expressed in genetically modified crops."

Our results showed that, at higher concentrations, both ME and TE extracts that contained varying amounts of aflatoxin caused a considerable decrease in Vero cell viability (up to 37%) after 4 h of exposure. Aflatoxins from ME induced greater oxidative damage by enhancing lipid peroxidation (up to 6.05 ± 0.14 μmol/mg protein) as compared to TE; however, TE also induced significant malondialdehyde formation in particular at the higher aflatoxin concentration tested (up to 2.7 ± 0.19 μmol/mg protein). The decrease in GSH level was also more pronounced in ME as compared to TE. Moreover, the Ames test results indicated that the mutagenic activity of TE was greatly reduced compared with that of ME based on his(-) → his(+) reversions in the Salmonella TA100 strain. According to these results, it is concluded that the microwave nixtamalization procedure reduced aflatoxins and their in vitro toxicity and mutagenic activity. In Mexico, aflatoxins are often found in maize destined for the tortilla industry; consequently, tortilla consumption invariably leads to an important intake of intact and/or modified aflatoxin molecules caused by the thermal-alkaline treatment used during production. Therefore, it is of the highest importance to check whether such intake has the potential to lead to higher risk for adverse human health effects. In view of these considerations, in vitro tests may thus be useful for predicting the potential cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of tortillas produced for human consumption using aflatoxin-contaminated maize."

The toxicity of purified Cry3Bb1 for the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was determined using a bioassay and gene expression analysis. In addition, a soil toxicity test was used to assess the effects on C. elegans of rhizosphere soil obtained from plots of an experimental field grown with Mon88017, the near-isogenic cultivar, or either of two conventional cultivars. Finally, the indigenous nematode communities from the experimental field site with Mon88017 and from the control cultivars were analyzed. The results showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of Cry3Bb1 on the growth and reproduction of C. elegans, with EC50 values of 22.3 mg l⁻¹ and 7.9 mg l⁻¹, respectively. Moreover, Cry-protein-specific defense genes were found to be up-regulated in the presence of either Cry1Ab or Cry3Bb1. However, C. elegans was not affected by rhizosphere soils from Mon88017 compared to the control plots, due to the very low Cry3Bb1 concentrations, as indicated by quantitative analyses (< 1 ng g⁻¹ soil). Nematode abundance and diversity were essentially the same between the various maize cultivars. At the last sampling date, nematode genus composition in Bt-maize plots differed significantly from that in two of the three non-Bt cultivars, including the near-isogenic maize, but the shift in genus composition did not influence the composition of functional guilds within the nematode communities. In conclusion, the risk to free-living soil nematodes posed by Mon88017 cultivation can be regarded as low, as long as Cry3Bb1 concentrations in soil remain four orders of magnitude below the toxicity threshold."

In this study, we explored the effects of three different food sources; corn litter (agriculture grain residuals), Mongolian oak litter (natural plant residuals), and yeast (common food for Collembola culture), on the microbiota of a winter-active Collembola species, Desoria ruseki. We found that microbial diversity and community composition of the Collembola were strongly altered after feeding with different food sources for 30 days. Collembola individuals fed on corn litter harbored the highest bacterial richness and were dominated by a representative of Microbacteriaceae. In contrast, those fed on yeast exhibited the lowest bacterial richness and were primarily colonized by Pseudomonas. The microbial communities associated with the winter-active Collembola differed significantly from those observed in the food. Collembola nutrient turnover also differed when cultured with different food sources, as indicated by the C and N stable isotopic signatures. Our study highlights microbial associations with stable isotopic enrichments of the host. Specifically, the Arthrobacter was positively correlated with δ13C enrichment in the host. Representatives of Microbacteriaceae, Micrococcaceae, TM7a, Devosia, and Rathayibacter were positively correlated with δ15N enrichment of the host.

As food and feed safety rankings depend on toxin contamination, including deoxynivalenol (DON), without toxins, nothing can be said about the risks involved in food and feed quality. Therefore, three susceptible, three medium-susceptible, and three medium-resistant mother lines were crossed with three testers with differing degrees of resistance and tested between 2017-2020. Two plot replicates and two fungal strains were used separately. The highest heterosis was found at the GER% with a 13% increase across 27 hybrids, including 7 hybrids showing negative heterosis (a higher hybrid performance above the parental mean), with a variance ranging between 63.5 and -55.4. For DON, the mean heterosis was negative at -35%, and only 10 of the 27 hybrids showed a positive heterosis. The mean heterosis for DON contamination, at 1% GER, was again negative (-19.6%, varying between 85% and 224%). Only 17 hybrids showed heterosis, while that of the other 17 was rated higher than the parental mean. A positive significant correlation was found only for GER% and DON; the other factors were not significant. Seven hybrids were identified with positive (2) or negative (5) heterosis for all traits, while the rest varied. For DON and GER, only 13 provided identical (positive or negative) heteroses. The majority of the hybrids appeared to diverge in the regulation of the three traits. The stability of GER and DON (variance across eight data sets) did not agree-only half of the genotypes responded similarly for the two traits. The genetic background for this trait is unknown, and there was no general agreement between traits. Thus, without toxin analyses, the evaluation of food safety is not possible. The variety in degrees of resistance to toxigenic fungi and resistance to toxin accumulation is an inevitable factor."

While improved nutrient management and conservation practices have been implemented to minimize leaching, nitrate levels in groundwater continue to increase in many long-term monitoring wells. To elucidate controls on leaching rates and N dynamics in agricultural soils across soil depths, and in response to seasonal and annual variation in management (e. g. , fertilizer input amount and summer irrigation), we intensively monitored the transport of water and nitrate every two weeks for four years through the vadose zone at three depths (0.8, 1.5, and 3.0 m) in a sweet corn (maize) field. Though nitrate leaching was highly variable among lysimeters at the same depth and across years, a strong pattern emerged: annual nitrate leaching significantly decreased with depth across the study, averaging ~104 kg N ha-1 yr-1 near the surface (0.8 m) versus ~56 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in the deep soil (3.0 m), a 54% reduction in leaching between the soil layers. Even though crops were irrigated in summer, most leaching (~72% below 3.0 m) occurred during the wet fall and winter. Based on steady state assumptions, a net equivalent of ~29% of surface N inputs leached below 3.0 m into the deeper soil and groundwater, while ~44% was removed in crop harvest, indicating considerable N retention in the soil (~27% of inputs or approximately 58 kg N ha-1 yr-1). The accumulation and long-term dynamics of deep soil N is a legacy of agricultural management that should be further studied to better manage and reduce nitrate loss to groundwater."

This paper systematically studied the distribution and transport of PFAAs in agricultural soil, irrigation water and precipitation, followed by crop bioaccumulation and finally human exposure of PFAAs within a 10km radius around a mega-fluorochemical industrial park (FIP). Hotspots of contamination by PFAAs were found near the FIP and downstream of the effluent discharge point with the maximum concentrations of 641ng/g in agricultural soil, 480ng/g in wheat grain, 58.8ng/g in maize grain and 4,862ng/L in precipitation. As the distance increased from the FIP, PFAAs concentrations in all media showed a sharp initial decrease followed by a moderate decline. Elevated PFAA concentrations in soil and grains were still present within a radius of 10 km of the FIP. The soil contamination was associated with the presence of PFAAs in irrigation water and precipitation, and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the dominant PFAA component in soil. However, due to bioaccumulation preference, short-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), especially perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), became the major PFAA contaminants in grains of wheat and maize. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for both grains showed a decrease with increasing chain length of PFAAs (approximately 0.5 log decrease per CF2 group). Compared to maize grain, wheat grain showed higher BAFs, possibly related to its higher protein content.

Specifically, maize grain had the highest proportion of samples contaminated above tolerable limits (80.3% and 71.1% for EU and EAC limits). Groundnut had 54.0% and 37.9% of samples above EU and EAC maximum tolerable limits.

Maize kernels may reach the soil by disintegration of cobs due to disease, using crushed maize cobs for game-feeding, left overs in manure dispersed during fertilisation or from transporting and handling of crushed cobs. The evidence of volunteer and feral maize in four Federal States in Austria (Burgenland, Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Styria) emphasises the necessity to consider these hitherto under-emphasised factors in an ecological risk assessment (ERA) of GM maize as a possible source for transgenes in non-agricultural habitats, because these plants could act as bridge for the spread of GM material into semi-natural habitats. In accordance with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which states that in principle maize has the potential to survive as a volunteer or feral plant also in regions with cold winters, the investigation of the frequency of their occurrence under Central European conditions should be part of future monitoring programmes in order to assess their potential for permitting transgene spread."

The risk of cadmium (Cd) contamination in a long-term (over 20 years) experimental field in North China with an annual crop rotation of winter wheat and summer maize was investigated. The long-term experiment had a complete randomized block design with seven fertilizer treatments and four replications. The seven fertilizer treatments were (1) organic compost (OM), (2) half organic compost plus half chemical fertilizer (OM + NPK), (3) NPK fertilizer (NPK), (4-6) chemical fertilizers without one of the major nutrients (NP, PK, and NK), and (7) an unamended control (CK). Soil samples from 0 to 20 cm were collected in 1989, 1999, and 2009 to characterize Cd and other soil properties. During the past 20 years, various extents of Cd accumulation were observed in the soil, and the accumulation was mainly affected by atmospheric dry and wet deposition and fertilization. In 2009, the average Cd concentration in the soil was 148 ± 15 μg kg(-1) and decreased in the order of NPK ≈ OM + NKP ≈ PK > NP ≈ NK > OM ≈ CK. Sequential extraction of Cd showed that the acid-soluble fraction (F1, 32 ± 7 %) and the residual fraction (F4, 31 ± 5 %) were the dominant fractions of Cd in the soil, followed by the reducible fraction (F2, 22 ± 5 %) and oxidizable fraction (F3, 15 ± 6 %). The acid-soluble Cd fraction in the soil and Cd accumulation in the crops increased with soil plant available K. Fraction F3 was increased by soil organic C (SOC) and crop yields, but SOC reduced the uptake of soil Cd by crops. The long-term P fertilization resulted in more Cd buildup in the soil than other treatments, but the uptake of Cd by crops was inhibited by the precipitation of Cd with phosphate in the soil. Although soil Cd was slightly increased over the 20 years of intensive crop production, both soil and grain/kernel Cd concentrations were still below the national standards for environmental and food safety."

The long-term goal of the research described herein is the application of biomarkers to the development of preventative interventions for use in human populations at high-risk for cancer. Several of the aflatoxin specific biomarkers have been validated in epidemiological studies and are now being used as intermediate biomarkers in prevention studies. The development of these aflatoxin biomarkers has been based upon the knowledge of the biochemistry and toxicology of aflatoxins gleaned from both experimental and human studies. These biomarkers have subsequently been utilised in experimental models to provide data on the modulation of these markers under different situations of disease risk.

Biocontrol efficacy and frequencies of the active ingredient genotypes decreased in the absence of annual treatment. Maize treated consecutively for 2 or 3 years had significantly (p < 0.05) less aflatoxin (92% less) in grain at harvest than untreated maize. Maize grain from treated fields subjected to simulated poor storage had significantly less (p < 0.05) aflatoxin than grain from untreated fields, regardless of application regimen. Active ingredients occurred at higher frequencies in soil and grain from treated fields than from untreated fields. The incidence of active ingredients recovered in soil was significantly correlated (r = 0.898; p < 0.001) with the incidence of active ingredients in grain, which in turn was also significantly correlated (r = -0.621, p = 0.02) with aflatoxin concentration.

Pharmacokinetic studies in rats treated with intragastric MTBE in corn oil gave an initial disposition T1/2 for MTBE of 0.32 h. The decline in the serum drug versus time curve for MTBE in rats was accompanied by a progressive increase in serum methanol concentrations to levels more than 50-200 times those of the parent compound. Repeated exposure of MTBE vapor by inhalation in rats resulted in dose-dependent increases in MTBE in the blood, brain, and adipose tissue compartments. Blood concentrations of TBA were also dose dependent and provided an estimate of the total amount of MTBE distributed to peripheral drug metabolizing compartments. Perirenal fat/blood MTBE concentration ratios ranged from 9.7 to 11.6 after 15 wk of intermittent exposure.

In the first instance, yeast grown in the laboratory showed a time-dependent increase in estradiol in the conditioned medium. However, the culture medium supplement Bacto-peptone was found to contain large amounts of estrone. When added to yeast cultures in the form of YPD medium (yeast extract, Bacto-peptone, and dextrose), S. cerevisiae converted the estrone to estradiol leading to the accumulation of estradiol over time. In the second instance, commercially purchased S. cerevisiae grown in a molasses medium exhibited substantial amounts of estradiol. However, corn and beet molasses contained sufficient estrone and estradiol to account for the findings. As in the first instance, the yeast converted the estrone into estradiol. In the third instance, autoclaving culture medium in polycarbonate plastic flasks was found to cause an estrogenic substance to be added to the medium, whether yeast were present or not. It was determined that the autoclaving process leached bisphenol-A (BPA) out of the polycarbonate plastic. BPA was shown to bind to estrogen receptors and to induce estrogenic activity, including stimulation of MCF-7 breast cancer-cell proliferation and induction of the expression of progesterone receptors.

At these low infection levels, correlations between visual symptoms and toxin contaminations were mostly non-significant, so it is not feasible to draw a conclusion about toxin contamination from ear rot coverage alone. The toxin contamination of hybrids for a percentage of visual infection is highly variable, and only toxin data can decide about food safety. Hybrids with no visual symptoms and high AFB1 contamination were also identified. Preharvest control, including breeding and variety registration, is therefore of the utmost importance to all three pathogens. Even natural ear rot and toxin data do not prove differences in resistance, so a high ear rot or toxin contamination level should be considered as a risk factor for hybrids. The toxin control of freshly harvested grain is vital for separating healthy and contaminated lots. In addition, proper growing and storage conditions must be ensured to protect the feed safety of the grain."

The emission factors (EFs) of anhydrosugars and some fatty acids showed slight variations between fresh and aged samples, indicating that these compounds are relatively stable. However, the EFs of n-alkanes, fatty alcohols, and parent-PAHs decreased 8-57% from fresh to aged samples, suggesting that they can undergo further oxidation to form other organic materials in the atmosphere. Phthalic acids, nitrophenols and isoprene-derived products were mainly secondarily formed by aging processes. Thus their EFs increased by 2-23 times from fresh to aged samples. Levoglucosan was the most abundant individual organic tracer, and its EF varied slightly between fresh and aged samples, proving its indicative role on BB emission. Moreover, the ratio of vanillic acid to levoglucosan and p-hydroxybenzoic acid to levoglucosan increased 2-13 times from fresh to aged samples.

Minor percentages were A. tamarii (6%), A. parasiticus (1%), and isolates with S strain morphology (3%). No A. bombycis or A. nomius isolates were detected. Phylogenetic analyses of partial sequences of the nitrate reductase gene (niaD, 1.3kb) and the aflatoxin pathway transcription factor gene (aflR, 1.7kb) were used to verify isolate assignments into species and lineages. Phylogenetics resolved S strain isolates producing only B aflatoxins into two lineages fully supported by sizes of deletions in the gene region spanning the aflatoxin biosynthesis genes cypA (aflU) and norB (aflF). One lineage was the A. flavus S strain with either 0.9 or 1.5kb deletions. The second lineage, recently described from Kenya, has a 2.2kb deletion. Taxa with S strain morphology differed in distribution with strain SBG limited to West Africa and both A. minisclerotigenes and the new lineage from Kenya in Central and East Africa. African A. flavus L strain isolates formed a single clade with L strain isolates from other continents. The sampled maize frequently tested positive for aflatoxins (65%), fumonisins (81%), and deoxynivalenol (40%) indicating the presence of fungi capable of producing the respective toxins. Percentage of samples exceeding US limits for total aflatoxins (regulatory limit), fumonisins (advisory limit), and deoxynivalenol (advisory limit) were 47%, 49%, 4%, respectively."

To address this gap, 16 young bulls received a control (C) diet between weaning at 9 months and 14 months, then were split into two groups of eight balanced on feed intake, BW gain and methane emission to receive either the C diet or a diet moderately supplemented with extruded linseed and calcium nitrate (LN) for 2 months before being slaughtered. On a dry matter (DM) basis, the C diet contained 70% baled grass silage and 30% concentrate mainly made of maize, wheat and rapeseed meal. In the LN diet, rapeseed meal and a fraction of cereals were replaced by 35% extruded linseed and 6% calcium nitrate; linseed fatty acids and nitrate supply in the LN diet were 1.9% and 1.0%, respectively. Methane emission was measured continuously using the GreenFeed system. Methaemoglobin was determined every week in peripheral blood from bulls receiving the LN diet. Nitrate and nitrite concentrations were determined in rumen, liver and tongue sampled at slaughter. Dry matter intake tended to be lower for LN diet (P=0.10). Body weight gain was lower for LN diet (P=0.01; 1.60 and 1.26 kg/day for C and LN diet, respectively). Daily methane emission was 9% lower (P<0.001) for LN than C diet (249 and 271 g/day, respectively) but methane yield did not differ between diets (24.1 and 23.2 g/kg DM intake for C and LN diet, respectively, P=0.34). Methaemoglobin was under the limit of detection (<2% of total haemoglobin) for most animals and was always lower than 5.6%, suggesting an absence of risk to animal health. Nitrite and nitrate concentrations in offal did not differ between C and LN diets. In conclusion, a moderate supply of linseed and nitrate in bull feed failed to decrease enteric methane yield and impaired bull liveweight gain but without adverse effects for animal health and food safety."

The accumulation of free (nonprotein) asparagine in crops has implications for food safety because free asparagine is the precursor for acrylamide, a carcinogenic contaminant that forms during high-temperature cooking and processing. Here we review publicly available genome data for asparagine synthetase genes from species of the Pooideae subfamily, including bread wheat and related wheat species (Triticum and Aegilops spp. ), barley (Hordeum vulgare) and rye (Secale cereale) of the Triticeae tribe. Also from the Pooideae subfamily: brachypodium (Brachypodium dIstachyon) of the Brachypodiae tribe. More diverse species are also included, comprising sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and maize (Zea mays) of the Panicoideae subfamily and rice (Oryza sativa) of the Ehrhartoideae subfamily. The asparagine synthetase gene families of the Triticeae species each comprise five genes per genome, with the genes assigned to four groups: 1, 2, 3 (subdivided into 3.1 and 3.2) and 4. Each species has a single gene per genome in each group, except that some bread wheat varieties (genomes AABBDD) and emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides; genomes AABB) lack a group 2 gene in the B genome. This raises questions about the ancestry of cultivated pasta wheat and the B genome donor of bread wheat, suggesting that the hybridisation event that gave rise to hexaploid bread wheat occurred more than once. In phylogenetic analyses, genes from the other species cluster with the Triticeae genes, but brachypodium, sorghum and maize lack a group 2 gene, while rice has only two genes, one group 3 and one group 4. This means that TaASN2, the most highly expressed asparagine synthetase gene in wheat grain, has no equivalent in maize, rice, sorghum or brachypodium. An evolutionary pathway is proposed in which a series of gene duplications gave rise to the five genes found in modern Triticeae species."

This research aimed to evaluate the presence of 50 pharmaceuticals, some transformation products, 7 TMs and a metalloid in the water-sediment-soil-plant system, and their potential to be bioaccumulated into edible parts of plants, as a result of the unplanned water reuse. The study site consists of an extensive agricultural land downstream Madrid city (Spain) where surface water, strongly impacted by WWTP effluents, is applied through gravity-based systems to cultivate mainly maize. Sampling campaigns were conducted to collect WWTP effluent, surface and irrigation water, river sediments, agricultural soils and maize fruits. Results demonstrate the ubiquitous presence of several pharmaceuticals. The concentration pattern in irrigation water did not resemble the pattern of contents in soils and plants. The pharmaceuticals included in the EU surface water watch lists were quantified in the lowest concentration range (macrolide antibiotics, ciprofloxacin) or were not detected (most of the hormones). Therefore, hormones do not represent an emerging risk in our scenario. The TMs and the metalloid in water and agricultural soils should not arise any concern. Whereas, their presence in the river sediments may have an adverse impact on aquatic ecosystems. Only acetaminophen, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, nicotine, Zn, Cu and Ni were quantified in corn grains. Calculated parameters to assess bioaccumulation and health risk indicate that neither pharmaceuticals nor TMs pose a threat to human health due to consumption of maize cultivated in the area.

The aim of this study is to provide data about the magnitude of attenuation processes and plant uptake, allowing for a reliable assessment of contaminant transfer among compartments and of the human health risk derived from unplanned water reuse activities. Target compounds are 25 pharmaceuticals, including transformation products (TPs). The field site is an agricultural parcel where maize is irrigated by a gravity-fed surface system supplied by the Jarama river, a water course strongly impacted by WWTP effluents. Throughout the 3-month irrigation period, irrigation water and water infiltrating through the vadose zone were sampled. The agricultural soil was collected before and after the irrigation campaign, and maize was sampled before harvesting. All selected compounds are detected in irrigation water (up to 12,867 ng L-1). Metformin, two metamizole TPs and valsartan occur with the highest concentrations. For most pharmaceuticals, results demonstrate a high natural attenuation during soil infiltration (>60%). However, leached concentrations of some compounds can be still at concern level (>400 ng L-1). A persistent behavior is observed for carbamazepine, carbamazepine epoxide and sulfamethoxazole. Pharmaceutical soil contents are in the order of ng g-1 and positively ionized compounds accumulate more effectively. Results also indicate the presence of a constant pool of drugs in soils. Only neutral and cationic pharmaceuticals are taken up in maize tissues, mainly in the roots.

The results showed that the body weight gain, testes weight, testis coefficient, sperm density, sperm activity, sperm survival rate and protein expression levels of p-ERK1, p-ERK2 and p-CREB decreased, but the sperm abnormality rate increased with increasing BPA concentrations. There were positive correlations between sperm density, sperm activity and sperm survival rate with protein expression levels of p-ERK1, p-ERK2 and p-CREB, and negative correlations between sperm abnormality rate with the protein expression levels of p-ERK1, p-ERK2 and p-CREB. Results from the structural equation model demonstrated that BPA retained a significant negative effect to p-ERK, whereas p-ERK retained a significant positive effect to sperm quality and acted as the mediate variable. This study provides a novel insight regarding the potential role of p-ERK1 and p-ERK2 protein kinase on reproductive toxicity of BPA. The adverse effects of BPA on adult male sperm quality may be through the induction of the disruption of ERK signal pathway.

Here we report the first results of a proteomic profiling coupled to transgene transcript expression analysis of a stacked commercial maize hybrid containing insecticidal and herbicide tolerant traits in comparison to the single event hybrids in the same genetic background. Our results show that stacked genetically modified (GM) genotypes were clustered together and distant from other genotypes analyzed by PCA. Twenty-two proteins were shown to be differentially modulated in stacked and single GM events versus non-GM isogenic maize and a landrace variety with Brazilian genetic background. Enrichment analysis of these proteins provided insight into two major metabolic pathway alterations: energy/carbohydrate and detoxification metabolism. Furthermore, stacked transgene transcript levels had a significant reduction of about 34% when compared to single event hybrid varieties. Stacking two transgenic inserts into the genome of one GM maize hybrid variety may impact the overall expression of endogenous genes. Observed protein changes differ significantly from those of single event lines and a conventional counterpart. Some of the protein modulation did not fall within the range of the natural variability for the landrace used in this study. Higher expression levels of proteins related to the energy/carbohydrate metabolism suggest that the energetic homeostasis in stacked versus single event hybrid varieties also differ. Upcoming global databases on outputs from ""omics"" analyses could provide a highly desirable benchmark for the safety assessment of stacked transgenic crop events. Accordingly, further studies should be conducted in order to address the biological relevance and implications of such changes."

Recovery of pyrene was evaluated for two different sampling media by first contaminating the hands of a small number of volunteers with UGEO, followed by applying a small amount of corn oil to the palms, and by wiping the skin with a Whatman cellulostic filter paper or a polyester fabric wipe (i. e. , Alpha wipes). In summary, using either Whatman or Alpha wipes, the mean recovery of pyrene from the UGEO that was applied to the hands and contained within three consecutive wipes was 69% and 54%, respectively. However, the relative recovery of the first to second wipe was on average 47% and 75% for the two media, respectively.

In this paper, aflatoxin contamination in freshly harvested and stored crop produce from central Tanzania was examined, including the efficacy of aflatoxin mitigation technologies on grain/kernal quality. A total of 312 farmers were recruited, trained on aflatoxin mitigation technologies, and allowed to deploy the technologies for 2 years. After 2 years, 188 of the 312 farmers were tracked to determine whether they had adopted and complied with the mitigation practices. Aflatoxigenic Aspergillus flavus and aflatoxin B1 contamination in freshly harvested and stored grains/kernels were assessed. A. flavus frequency and aflatoxin production by fungi were assayed by examining culture characteristics and thin-layer chromatography respectively. AFB1 was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The average aflatoxin contamination in freshly harvested samples was 18.8 μg/kg, which is above the acceptable standard of 10 μg/kg. Contamination increased during storage to an average of 57.2 μg/kg, indicating a high exposure risk. Grains and oilseeds from maize, sorghum, and sunflower produced in aboveground reproductive structures had relatively low aflatoxin contamination compared to those produced in geocarpic structures of groundnut and bambara nut. Farmers who adopted recommended post-harvest management practices had considerably lower aflatoxin contamination in their stored kernels/grains. Furthermore, the effects of these factors were quantified by multivariate statistical analyses. Training and behavioral changes by farmers in their post-harvest practice minimize aflatoxin contamination and improve food safety. Moreover, if non-trained farmers receive mitigation training, aflatoxin concentration is predicted to decrease by 28.9 μg/kg on average."

A total of 1960 food samples comprising all known relevant groups of products were analysed for fumonisins. Furthermore, 272 of these samples were also analysed for hydrolysed fumonisins (HFB). For routine analysis enzyme immunoassay was used, confirmatory and control analyses were performed using HPLC-FLD after precolumn derivatisation, or by LC-MS/MS. Daily intake of fumonisins was calculated by combining fumonisin contamination data obtained in this study with available food consumption data for Germany. In a ""mean case"" scenario, median fumonisin levels in foods and mean food intake values were used. To generate a ""bad case"" scenario, the 90(th) percentile of fumonisin levels in foods and mean food intake values were combined. The overall daily fumonisin intake by the German consumer was 1.1 μg in the ""mean case"" scenario, and 21 μg in the ""bad case"" scenario. It was concluded that in general there is no increased risk for the German consumer in aspects of exceeding the recommended tolerable daily intake of fumonisins (2 μg/kg body weight). However, certain products (and certain brands of products) were repeatedly found to contain elevated fumonisin levels, which in a ""worst case"" scenario (""high"" food intake of maize-based products) could pose a potential risk for the consumer, in particular concerning foods for infants and young children. High fumonisin levels were found in infant foods in 1999, but contamination levels decreased strongly in the following years. HFBs (mostly HFB1) were frequently found in processed cereals such as corn flakes, but in relatively low concentrations. According to our findings, the new European Union maximum levels for fumonisins are suitable to eliminate peak contamination levels of fumonisins in foods, but would lead to a regular excess of the TDI for infants and young children if these maximum levels would indeed be exhausted."

This study integrated the analysis of the heavy metal contamination status and human health risk in soil and maize near coal mines to help formulate control strategies for soil quality, maize production, and safe consumption. This study was carried out on maize agricultural land near a coal mining plant. Heavy metal contamination was assessed by the geo-accumulation index (Igeo), enrichment factor (EF), and bioaccumulation factor (BCF). The Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate the probabilistic health risk of heavy metals exposure in soil and maize. The relationship between the concentration of heavy metal in the soil and that in maize was further visualized by correlation analysis and random forest analysis. The results revealed that the mean concentrations of soil Ni, Cu, As, Cd, Sn, Zn, Pb, and Hg were all above the local background level. Ni was the most severely polluted heavy metal in maize and had a concentration higher than the risk control standard for corn in China (NY 861-2004). The Igeo values of all heavy metals were low, and EF values showed enrichment in V, Cr, Ti, Ni, and As. The assessment of probabilistic health risk exposed by heavy metals in soil and maize indicated that 1.16 and 1.46% of residents exceeded the carcinogenic risk level due to heavy metal exposure from soil and maize, respectively. Children were the most sensitive to maize and soil heavy metal exposure in the contaminated area. Ingestion of heavy metals was associated with the highest health risk to residents, followed by dermal contact and inhalation. As and Cr in soil and Cr and Ni in maize had the greatest impact on human health risk. Furthermore, maize heavy metals were affected the most by soil Cr, Cd, and V. These results may provide useful information for human carcinogenic risk associated with soil and maize heavy metal exposure due to coal mining activities."

A total of 120 samples (60maize and 60wheat) were collected using purposive and stratified random sampling. Isolation of fungi from collected food grains were done using dry inspection and incubation test (agar plate method) and identification was done based on cultural characteristics and microscopic features. Results of the current study indicated that the mean fungal contamination of the food grains had the highest levels of infection and contamination. Maize was infected by more than 11 different genera of 831 different fungi while the wheat seeds were also infected by 8 genera of 768 different molds. Across the study sites, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium and Alternaria were the most predominant fungal genera identified among the study sites. There was more mycotoxin producing fungal genera isolated from those samples of both maize and wheat with high level of contamination. Mycotoxin levels increased with storage time such that maize and wheat samples stored for more than six months may exceed the levels greater than the FDA/WHO regulatory limits. Hence, indicating that maize and wheat consumers in the study area are exposed to the danger of mycotoxin poisoning. Thus, there is the need for policy makers to establish and enforce food grain quality standards and regulations related to molds and mycotoxins across the country and specifically among study area to minimize health hazards related to consumption of contaminated foods."

Plots were established and planted with maize (Zea mays) in a rye field (Secale cereale) near Göttingen (northern Germany) in May 1999. In October 1999, April 2000, and October 2000, meso- and macrofauna and maize and rye litter were collected in each plot and analyzed for 13C and 15N content. 15N signatures suggested that the soil animal species analyzed span three trophic levels with the trophic position of species varying little in time. The species investigated formed a continuum from primary to secondary decomposers to predators. On average, predator species differed from primary and secondary decomposers by 3.9 sigma15N suggesting that they fed on a mixed diet of both decomposer groups. The combined analysis of 13C and 15N signatures allowed us to identify links between prey and consumer species. In October 1999, shortly after maize residues had been incorporated into the plots, maize-born carbon was present in each of the animal species investigated, including top predators. The incorporation of maize carbon into the belowground food web increased during the following 12 months but the concentration of maize-born carbon never exceeded 50% in any of the species. Furthermore, the ranks of the incorporation of maize-born carbon of the species changed little. The results suggest that the belowground food web relies heavily on carbon originating from plant residues from before the recent two growing seasons. In most species the amount of maize-born carbon increased continuously; however, in some species it decreased during winter, suggesting that these species switched to a diet based more on C3 plants during winter, or predominantly metabolized carbon incorporated during the last growing season. The study documents that the combined analysis of 13C and 15N signatures in soil invertebrate species, after replacement of C3 by C4 plants, is a powerful tool to better understand the structure of the belowground food web and the flux of carbon through it."

Seventy-nine of the samples were of ground waters and 19 were of surface waters.

Four different types of food matrices were chosen for validation: apple puree for infants (high water content), hazelnuts (high fat content), maize (high starch and low fat content) and green pepper (difficult or unique matrix). Method accuracy and precision was evaluated using spiked samples in five replicates at two concentration levels. Method trueness was demonstrated through participation in various proficiency tests. Although the method covers a total number of 331 analytes, validation data were acquired only for 295 analytes, either due to the non-availability of analytical standards or due other reasons described in this paper. Concerning the apparent recovery, the percentage of 295 analytes matching the acceptable recovery range of 70-120% lied down by SANCO varied from 21% in green pepper to 74% in apple puree at the highest spiking level. At the levels close to limit of quantification only 20-58% of the analytes fulfilled this criterion. The extent of matrix effects was strongly dependent on the analyte/matrix combination. In general, the lowest matrix effects were observed in apple puree (59% of analytes were not influenced by enhancement/suppression at all at the highest validation level). The highest matrix effects were observed in green pepper, where only 10% of analytes did not suffer from signal suppression/enhancement. The repeatability of the method was acceptable (RSD≤20) for 97% of all analytes in apple puree and hazelnuts, for 95% in maize and for 89% in green pepper. Concerning the trueness of the method, Z-scores were generally between -2 and 2, despite a broad variety of different matrices.

The study focused on feed aspects limiting dual-purpose chicken production in semi-intensive and intensive systems. A total of 101 farmers were interviewed using a semistructured questionnaire and the amount of feed provided to chickens per day was quantified. Feed was sampled for laboratory analysis and physical assessments were made of weights of chicken bodies and eggs.

Indigenous chickens were fed 111 and 67 while the improved crossbred chickens were fed 118 and 119 g/chicken unit/d under semi-intensive and intensive systems, respectively. Most feeds fed to dual-purpose chickens were of low nutritional quality, particularly lacking in crude protein and essential amino acids in both rearing systems and breeds. Maize bran, sunflower seedcake, and fishmeal were the main sources of energy and protein in the study area. The study findings show that the important feed ingredients: protein sources, essential amino acids, and premixes were expensive, and were not included in formulating compound feeds by most chicken farmers. Of all 101 respondents interviewed, only one was aware of aflatoxin contamination and its effects on animal and human health. All feed samples contained a detectable concentration of aflatoxins and 16% of them exceeded the allowed toxicity thresholds (>20 µg/kg).

The samples were mixed on a vortex mixer and decanted into a d-SPE tube containing octadecylsilyl (C18) and primary secondary amine (PSA) sorbents and magnesium sulfate. The samples were centrifuged before evaporation to dryness. Pyrethroids were extracted and reconstituted from the residue using toluene in advance of injection into an Agilent Model 6890N gas chromatograph equipped with a Model 5973 quadrupole mass analyzer. Samples were ionized via electron capture in the negative ion mode using methane as a chemical ionization gas. Six qualifying ions were monitored using selected-ion monitoring for quantitation and verification of the analyte. Cis-permethrin was used as the internal standard. Method linearity was from 1 to 500 ng/mL for muscle and liver homogenates. The inter- and intraday precision and accuracy of the method were better than 20% at the lower LOQ and better than 15% over the remainder of the linear range. The method was used to elucidate tissue time-courses of deltamethrin (DLM) disposition following oral dosing of rats with 1 to 5 mg/kg in corn oil. DLM was monitored in rat tissue samples ≤24 h following dosing. Sample cleanup with d-SPE provided more selective chromatography than previous analytical methods."

However, their input dynamics and fate in surface waters are still rather poorly understood. This study compares the aquatic fate, concentration levels, and dynamics of the transformation product metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid (metolachlor ESA) and its parent compound metolachlor, an often-used corn herbicide. To this end, laboratory photolysis studies were combined with highly temporally resolved concentration measurements and lake mass balance modeling in the study area of Lake Greifensee (Switzerland). It is found that the two compounds show distinctly different concentration dynamics in the lake tributaries. Concentration-discharge relationships for metolachlor ESA in the main tributary showed a high baseflow concentration and increasing discharge dependence during harvest season, whereas baseflow concentrations of metolachlor were negligible and the discharge dependence was restricted to the period immediately following application. From this it was estimated that 70% of the yearly load of metolachlor ESA to the lake was due to groundwater recharge, whereas, for metolachlor, the bigger part of the load, 50-80%, stemmed from event-driven runoff. Lake mass balance modeling showed that the input dynamics of metolachlor and metolachlor ESA are reflected in their concentration dynamics in the lake's epilimnion and that both compounds show a similar fate in the epilimnion of Lake Greifensee during the summer months with half-lives on the order of 100-200 days, attributable to photolysis and another loss process of similar magnitude, potentially biodegradation. The behavior of metolachlor ESA can likely be generalized to other persistent and highly mobile transformation products. In the future, this distinctly different behavior of mobile pesticide transformation products should find a more appropriate reflection in exposure models used in chemical risk assessment and in pesticide risk management."

Bioaccumulation characteristics of PFASs in light of crop types and organs were explored, followed by analyzing human exposure and risks to local residents with different age groups and dietary habits. Elevated levels of ∑PFASs were found nearby the FIP ranging from 79.9 ng/g to 200 ng/g in soils and from 58.8 ng/g to 8085 ng/g in crops. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the predominant PFAS component in soil; while shorter-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), especially perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), were the major PFAS contaminants in multiple crops, resulting from their bioaccumulation preference. Depending on the crop types, the bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of ∑PFASs for edible parts varied from 0.36 to 48.0, and the highest values were found in shoot vegetables compared with those in fruit vegetables, flower vegetables, root vegetables and grain crops. For typical grains, the BAFs of ∑PFASs decreased in the order of soybean (Glycine max (Linn. ) Merr. ), wheat (Triticum aestivum L. ) and corn (Zea mays L. ), possibly related to their protein and lipid content. Among specific organs in the whole plants, leaves exhibited the highest BAFs of ∑PFASs compared with corresponding roots, stems, husks or grains. With increasing carbon chain lengths of individual PFCAs (C4-C8), the logarithm of their BAFs for edible parts of various crops showed a linear decrease (0.1-1.16 log decrease per CF2 unit), and the largest decrease was observed in grains. Human exposure to PFOA via the consumption of contaminated crops represents a health risk for local residents, especially for low-age consumers or urban consumers with higher vegetable diet.

In addition to stimulated microbial activity, the supply of fresh soluble organic (C) from litter may accelerate the microbial degradation of chemicals in soils. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test whether the maize litter enhances degradation of 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) and increases formation of non-toxic biogenic non-extractable residues (bioNERs). Soil was amended with 13C6-MCPA and incubated with or without litter addition on the top. Three soil layers were sampled with increasing distance from the top: 0-2 mm, 2-5 mm and 5-20 mm; and the mass balance of 13C6-MCPA transformation determined. Maize litter promoted microbial activity, mineralization of 13C6-MCPA and bioNER formation in the upper two layers (0-2 and 2-5 mm). The mineralization of 13C6-MCPA in soil with litter increased to 27% compared to only 6% in the control. Accordingly, maize addition reduced the amount of extractable residual MCPA in soil from 77% (control) to 35% of initially applied 13C6-MCPA. While non-extractable residues (NERs) were <6% in control soil, litter addition raised NERs to 21%. Thereby, bioNERs comprised 14% of 13C6-MCPA equivalents. We found characteristic differences of bioNER formation with distance to litter. While total NERs in soil at a distance of 2-5 mm were mostly identified as 13C-bioNERs (97%), only 45-46% of total NERs were assigned to bioNERs in the 0-2 and 5-20 mm layers. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis indicated that fungi and Gram-negative bacteria were mainly involved in MCPA degradation. Maize-C particularly stimulated fungal activity in the adjacent soil, which presumably facilitated non-biogenic NER formation. The plant litter accelerated formation of both non-toxic bioNERs and non-biogenic NERs. More studies on the structural composition of non-biogenic NERs with toxicity potential are needed for future recommendations on litter addition in agriculture."

A health risk assessment model was used to assess the health risks of those areas, and the environmental benchmarks of heavy metals in soils were evaluated using the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) model. The results showed that the soils of maize and rice were polluted by heavy metals. Cd was the primary pollutant, with an exceeding rate ranging from 87% to 445%. The contaminated level of maize fields was higher than those of rice fields. In contrast, only 3.51% and 13.4% of Cd content in maize kernels and rice grains exceeded the national threshold, and the Cd heavy metal accumulation ability of rice was higher than that of maize. The carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks of heavy metals for adults and children in the study area were at a low level. The carcinogenic risk of rice consumption was slightly higher than that of maize, and the health risk to children was higher than that to adults. The results derived from the SSD method showed that the 95% and 5% hazardous concentrations (HC5 and HC95) of maize fields were 0.67 for Cd, 771.99 for As, 40.85 for Pb and 609.88 for Cr mg·kg-1, and HC95were 48.47 for Cd, 159.67 for As, 1735.68 for Pb and 1671.74 for Cr mg·kg-1, respectively.

Aflatoxins are toxic mold metabolites produced by toxigenic strains of Aspergillus species. Primary commodities susceptible to aflatoxin contamination include corn, peanuts and cottonseed and animal-derived foods such as milk when the animal is fed aflatoxin-contaminated feed. Risks associated with aflatoxin-contaminated foods can be reduced through the use of specific processing and decontamination procedures. Factors, which influence the effectiveness of a specific process or procedure, include the chemical stability of the mycotoxin(s), nature of the process, type and interaction with the food/feed matrix and interaction with multiple mycotoxins if present. Practical decontamination procedures must: 1) inactivate, destroy, or remove the toxin, 2) not produce or leave toxic residues in the food/feed, 3) retain the nutritive value of the food/feed, 4) not alter the acceptability or the technological properties of the product, and, if possible, 5) destroy fungal spores. For aflatoxins, multiple processing and/or decontamination schemes have been successful in reducing aflatoxin concentrations to acceptable levels. Physical cleaning and separation procedures, where the mold-damaged kernel/seed/nut is removed from the intact commodity, can result in 40-80% reduction in aflatoxins levels. Processes such as dry and wet milling result in the distribution of aflatoxin residues into less utilized fractions of the commodity. The ammoniation of aflatoxin-contaminated commodities has altered the concentrations as well as toxic and carcinogenic effects of aflatoxin by greater than 99%. Nonbiological materials such as selected anticaking agents covalently bind aflatoxins from aqueous suspensions, diminish aflatoxin uptake by animals, prevent acute aflatoxicosis, and decrease aflatoxin residues in milk. Ultimately, the best processing or decontamination process is one that is approved by regulatory agencies, cost-effective, and reduces the mycotoxin concentration to acceptable levels."

Analysed were documents of rape (glucosinolates, phytate), maize (phytate), tomato (tomatine, solanine, chaconine, lectins, oxalate), potato (solanine, chaconine, protease-inhibitors, phenols) and soybean (protease-inhibitors, lectins, isoflavones, phytate). In several documents used for notifications no declarations even on essential inherent plant toxins and antinutrients could be found, for instance data on phytate in modified maize were provided only in one of four documents. Significant variations in the contents of these compounds in parental and modified plants especially due to environmental influences were observed: drought stress, for example, was made responsible for significantly increased glucosinolate levels of up to 72.6micromol/g meal in modified and parental rape plants in field trials compared to recommended standard concentrations of less than 30micromol/g. Taking into account these wide natural variations generally the concentrations of inherent plant toxins and antinutrients in modified products were in the range of the concentrations in parental organisms. The results presented indicate that the concept of the substantial equivalence is useful for the risk assessment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) used for novel foods but possible environmental influences on constituents of modified crops need more attention. Consistent guidelines, specifying data of relevant compounds which have to be provided for notification documents of specific organisms have to be established.

One hundred field isolates were used to establish a baseline sensitivity of B. maydis against fludioxonil during 2015-2016. The results showed that the baseline sensitivity was distributed as a unimodal curve with a mean EC50 value of 0.044±0.022μgmL-1. With repeated exposure to fludioxonil, a total of five fludioxonil-resistant mutants (RF>100, RF=Resistance factor) were obtained in the laboratory. Compared with the parental isolates, the five fludioxonil-resistant mutants showed decreased fitness in sporulation and virulence, and exhibited different features of sensitivity to various stresses (oxidation and osmotic pressure, cell membrane and cell wall inhibitors), but not in mycelial growth on PDA without stress amendation. The five fludioxonil-resistant mutants showed a positive cross-resistance between fludioxonil and the dicarboximide fungicide procymidone, but not between fludioxonil and boscalid or fluazinam. All mutants exhibited stable resistance to fludioxonil after 10 transfers, as indicated by resistance factor values that ranged from 116.82 to 445.59.

World production is around 790 million tonnes of maize because as a staple food it provides more than one-third of the calories and proteins in some countries. Stored maize is a man-made ecosystem in which quality and nutritive changes occur because of interactions between physical, chemical and biological factors. Fungal spoilage and mycotoxin contamination are of major concern. Aspergillus and Fusarium species can infect maize pre-harvest, and mycotoxin contamination can increase if storage conditions are poorly managed. Prevention strategies to reduce the impact of mycotoxin in maize food and feed chains are based on using a hazard analysis critical control point systems (HACCP) approach. To reduce or prevent production of mycotoxins, drying should take place soon after harvest and as rapidly as feasible. The critical water content for safe storage corresponds to a water activity (a(w)) of about 0.7. Problems in maintaining an adequately low a(w) often occur in the tropics where high ambient humidity make the control of commodity moisture difficult. Damage grain is more prone to fungal invasion and, therefore, mycotoxin contamination. It is important to avoid damage before and during drying, and during storage. Drying maize on the cob before shelling is a very good practice. In storage, many insect species attack grain and the moisture that can accumulate from their activities provides ideal conditions for fungal activity. To avoid moisture and fungal contamination, it is essential that the numbers of insects in stored maize should be kept to a minimum. It is possible to control fungal growth in stored commodities by controlled atmospheres, preservatives or natural inhibitors. Studies using antioxidants, essential oils under different conditions of a(w), and temperature and controlled atmospheres have been evaluated as possible strategies for the reduction of fungal growth and mycotoxin (aflatoxins and fumonisins) in stored maize, but the cost of these treatments is likely to remain prohibitive for large-scale use."

The AITL method accounts for the total mass of insecticides used in the US, acute toxicity to insects using honey bee contact and oral LD50 as reference values for arthropod toxicity, and the environmental persistence of the pesticides. This screening analysis shows that the types of synthetic insecticides applied to agricultural lands have fundamentally shifted over the last two decades from predominantly organophosphorus and N-methyl carbamate pesticides to a mix dominated by neonicotinoids and pyrethroids. The neonicotinoids are generally applied to US agricultural land at lower application rates per acre; however, they are considerably more toxic to insects and generally persist longer in the environment. We found a 48- and 4-fold increase in AITL from 1992 to 2014 for oral and contact toxicity, respectively. Neonicotinoids are primarily responsible for this increase, representing between 61 to nearly 99 percent of the total toxicity loading in 2014. The crops most responsible for the increase in AITL are corn and soybeans, with particularly large increases in relative soybean contributions to AITL between 2010 and 2014. Oral exposures are of potentially greater concern because of the relatively higher toxicity (low LD50s) and greater likelihood of exposure from residues in pollen, nectar, guttation water, and other environmental media. Using AITL to assess oral toxicity by class of pesticide, the neonicotinoids accounted for nearly 92 percent of total AITL from 1992 to 2014. Chlorpyrifos, the fifth most widely used insecticide during this time contributed just 1.4 percent of total AITL based on oral LD50s. Although we use some simplifying assumptions, our screening analysis demonstrates an increase in pesticide toxicity loading over the past 26 years, which potentially threatens the health of honey bees and other pollinators and may contribute to declines in beneficial insect populations as well as insectivorous birds and other insect consumers."

A total of 250 maize samples were randomly collected from nine provinces (Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Ningxia) in China. Fusarium species were isolated and identified using morphological (electron microscope) and molecular methods (polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing). Fumonisins B1 and B2 were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) with OPA (2-Mercaptoethanol, o-phthaldialdehyde) post-column derivatisation. A total of 2321 Fusarium isolates (20.7%) were obtained from all the samples. These isolates included nine Fusarium species, namely, F. graminearum, F. verticillioides, F. subglutinans, F. proliferatum, F. temperatum, F. oxysporum, F. equiseti, F. meridionale and F. chlamydosporum. The incidence of occurrence of Fusarium species in Guizhou was the highest, while in Inner Mongolia it was the lowest. F. verticillioides was the dominant species of maize ear rot in Liaoning, Sichuan, Hebei and Ningxia. F. graminearum was the dominant species in Yunnan, Guizhou and Shanxi.

A variety of seed-treatment and foliar insecticides are used to manage early- and late-season pests in these landscapes. Thus, there is a need to assess risks of these insecticides to monarch butterfly life stages to inform habitat conservation practices. Chronic and acute dietary toxicity studies were undertaken with larvae and adults, and acute topical bioassays were conducted with eggs, pupae, and adults using 6 representative insecticides: beta-cyfluthrin (pyrethroid), chlorantraniliprole (anthranilic diamide), chlorpyrifos (organophosphate), imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam (neonicotinoids). Chronic dietary median lethal concentration values for monarch larvae ranged from 1.6 × 10-3 (chlorantraniliprole) to 5.3 (chlorpyrifos) μg/g milkweed leaf, with the neonicotinoids producing high rates of arrested pupal ecdysis. Chlorantraniliprole and beta-cyfluthrin were generally the most toxic insecticides to all life stages, and thiamethoxam and chlorpyrifos were generally the least toxic. The toxicity results were compared to insecticide exposure estimates derived from a spray drift model and/or milkweed residue data reported in the literature. Aerial applications of foliar insecticides are expected to cause high downwind mortality in larvae and eggs, with lower mortality predicted for adults and pupae. Neonicotinoid seed treatments are expected to cause little to no downslope mortality and/or sublethal effects in larvae and adults. Given the vagile behavior of nonmigratory monarchs, considering these results within a landscape-scale context suggests that adult recruitment will not be negatively impacted if new habitat is established in close proximity of maize and soybean fields in the agricultural landscapes of the north central United States.

Broad-spectrum, non-selective herbicides used with GMHR crops are expected to substitute for a set of currently used herbicides, which might alter the agro-environmental footprint from crop production. To test this hypothesis, the environmental impact of various herbicide regimes currently used with non-GMHR maize in Belgium was calculated and compared with that of possible herbicide regimes applied in GMHR maize. Impacts on human health and the environment were calculated through the pesticide occupational and environmental risk (POCER) indicator. Results showed that the environmental impact of herbicide regimes solely relying on the active ingredients glyphosate (GLY) or glufosinate-ammonium (GLU) is lower than that of herbicide regimes applied in non-GMHR maize. Due to the lower potential of GLY and GLU to contaminate ground water and their lower acute toxicity to aquatic organisms, the POCER exceedence factor values for the environment were reduced approximately by a sixth when GLY or GLU is used alone. However, the environmental impact of novel herbicide regimes tested may be underestimated due to the assumption that active ingredients used with GMHR maize would be used alone. Data retrieved from literature suggest that weed control efficacy is increased and resistance development delayed when GLY or GLU is used together with other herbicides in the GMHR system. Due to the partial instead of complete replacement of currently used herbicide regimes, the beneficial environmental impact of novel herbicide regimes might sometimes be reduced or counterbalanced. Despite the high weed control efficacy provided by the biotechnology-based weed management strategy, neither indirect harmful effects on farmland biodiversity through losses in food resources and shelter, nor shifts in weed communities have been demonstrated in GMHR maize yet. However, with the increasing adoption rate of GMHR maize and their associated novel herbicide regimes, this situation is expected to change in the short-term."

Factors such as dose (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg fipronil kg(-1) grain), exposure interval (24 h, 48 h, 7 days and 14 days), temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees C), relative humidity (RH; 55 and 65%) and commodity (wheat, maize, barley and paddy rice) were evaluated with regard to their impact on the insecticidal activity of fipronil. Progeny production was assessed after 64 days of exposure. At doses of < 1 mg fipronil kg(-1) grain, efficacy of fipronil was enhanced by an increase in temperature from 20 to 25 degrees C against S. oryzae or R. dominica for exposures of > 48 h and against T. confusum or P. truncatus for exposures of > 24 h. A further increase in temperature from 25 to 30 degrees C, although it enhanced efficacy at doses of < 1 mg fipronil kg(-1) grain against S. oryzae at all exposure intervals and against T. confusum after 7 days of exposure, it was negatively associated with efficacy against R. dominica or P. truncatus for exposures of > 24 h. By contrast, increase in RH did not have a significant impact on efficacy of fipronil. Although the performance of fipronil among the tested commodities was species dependent, this substance appeared to be less effective in paddy rice than in barley, maize and wheat. Regardless of the treated commodity, progeny production of all the tested species was almost suppressed with doses higher than 0.1 mg fipronil kg(-1) grain.

As scarce information is available, the current study is aimed at collecting new data on the co-occurrence and the fate of the most frequent masked, modified and emerging mycotoxins and other second fungal metabolites in maize food products and by-products. Three maize lots, obtained in different growing seasons, were processed using two different degermination processes, a dry-degermination system or a tempering-degermination one, in order to compare the interaction between mycotoxins and the dry-milling management system. Whole grain before and after cleaning, and all the products and the by-products were sampled twice for each lot and were subjected to a multi-mycotoxin LC-MS/MS analysis. More than 30 mycotoxins and other fungal metabolites, including masked or modified forms, co-occurred in all the maize milling fractions. Grain cleaning reduced all the detected fungal metabolites by 1.2-2 times, compared to the grain before cleaning. Animal feed flour showed the highest content of almost all the mycotoxins and fungal metabolites, with a consequent negative impact on animal health. Considering that for all the mycotoxins and fungal metabolites an inverse relationship with particle size was observed, flaking grits represented the healthiest maize products with the least contamination level, while the abatement was always lower for maize flour.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) indicated that frozen sweet corn from a producer in Hungary was the source of illness. However, limited data is available on the prevalence of Listeria in frozen produce. A study of frozen fruit and vegetables from catering and retail premises in England was therefore carried out to assess their microbiological quality with respect to Listeria and Escherichia coli. Between December 2018 and April 2019, 1050 frozen fruit and vegetable samples were collected. Of these, 99% were of a satisfactory or borderline microbiological quality. Eleven samples (1%) contained ≥100 cfu/g of Escherichia coli (considered unsatisfactory in products labelled as ready-to-eat). Listeria monocytogenes or other Listeria species were detected in six samples (2%) of fruit compared to 167 samples (24%) of vegetables and six samples (26%) of fruit and vegetable mixes, but none at a level of ≥100 cfu/g. Characterisation by WGS of 74 L. monocytogenes isolates identified ten genetic clusters indicating a common source. For 8 of the 10 clusters, the isolates came from homogenous food types: four were sweet corn, and there was one cluster each for beans, peas, peppers and broccoli. There were five genetic associations between isolates from frozen vegetables and from clinical cases of listeriosis, including two cultures from frozen beans that were indistinguishable from the 2015-2018 sweet corn outbreak strain. This study indicates that L. monocytogenes was present in 10% of frozen vegetables and even though products are generally not ready-to-eat and are intended to be cooked prior to consumption, these have the potential to cause illness. Clear cooking and handling instructions are therefore required on these products to ensure that the health of consumers is not put at risk, and appropriate Good Manufacturing Practice measures should be followed by all fruit and vegetable freezing plants in order to reduce contamination with Listeria during processing."

They cause liver and kidney toxicity in animals in addition to leukoencephalomalacia in horses and pulmonary edema in pigs. Fumonisin B(1) is carcinogenic in rats and mice. Ecological studies have linked consumption of fumonisin contaminated maize with oesophageal cancer in human populations in South Africa and China. This review discusses the potential health risks for people exposed to the fumonisins, and describes how mechanistic studies of toxicity in animal models have allowed the development of putative biomarkers of fumonisin exposure at the individual level. The requirements for an applicable biomarker include sample availability as well as a high specificity and sensitivity for the exposure of interest. Most environmental toxic insults involve complex exposures both to other toxins and to infections; these confounding factors need to be considered in assessing both the validity of the biomarker and the exposure-disease associations. Fumonisins can be detected in the urine of animals in feeding studies but the sensitivity of the current methodology means only highly exposed people could be monitored. Mechanistic studies indicate that ceramide synthase, an enzyme involved in sphingolipid synthesis, is one cellular target for fumonisin toxicity and carcinogenicity, and this disruption to sphingolipid metabolism increases the ratio of two sphingoid precursors, sphinganine and sphingosine. The altered ratio has been observed in tissues, serum and urine for a number of animal models suggesting it as a good candidate marker of fumonisin exposure. Despite development of analytical methods to measure this biomarker there have been no studies to date correlating it to fumonisin intake in people. Given the toxic effects of fumonisins in animals and the widespread human exposure, which has been calculated to reach 440 micrograms kg(-1) body weight day(-1) in a population consuming high quantities (460 g day(-1)) of contaminated maize, then the development of biomarkers and their application in epidemiological studies should be a priority for research on these toxins."

We analyzed the amount of antimony in the soil, basic physical and chemical properties, and antimony content in agricultural products; studied the characteristics of antimony migration and transformation in the soil-agricultural product system; and conducted safety assessments on soil and agricultural products. The results showed that the soil ω(Sb) in the central area of the mine, the southern area of the mine, the central township area, the urban-rural transfer area, and the northern area of the mine reached (2348±2165), (1298±884.1), (311.8±526.5), (302.5±355.9), and (215.6±183.2) mg·kg-1, and the exceeding multiples reached 65.22, 36.06, 8.66, 8.40, and 5.99 times, respectively. The antimony enrichment coefficients of lettuce, scallion, cabbage, water spinach, garlic, and pea seedlings in agricultural products were 0.01-0.1, which indicated good antimony absorption capacity. The antimony enrichment coefficients of loofah, asparagus lettuce, pepper, carrot, bitter gourd, corn, eggplant, cowpea, and celery were less than 0.01, and the antimony absorption capacity was relatively poor. The safety assessment results showed that roots, allium, and garlic vegetables had a high risk of antimony pollution; leafy vegetables and legumes had a higher risk of antimony pollution; and solanaceous vegetables, melons, and fruit vegetables and corn (cereals) had a high risk of antimony pollution. Therefore, it is urgent to take soil antimony pollution control measures in the mining area. At the same time, in order to realize the safe use of agricultural land in the mining area, the farmland far away from the low antimony content of the soil in the central area of the mine should be selected as the planting area, and the agricultural products with weak antimony absorption capacity should be planted first."

AFs production is regulated by diverse factors including AFs cluster genes, transcription factors, regulators, and environmental factors. Among them, crop substrate is one of the most important factors. Here, we found that AFB1 production was significantly higher in maize and rice broth than in peanut broth. To clarify the mechanisms involved, complementary transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were performed to identify changes in A. flavus incubated in the three crop substrates. The results indicated that fewer genes and proteins were differentially expressed between maize and rice substrates, whereas more differentially expressed genes were observed between maize/rice broth and peanut broth. In particular, the genes involved in the initial step of AFs biosynthesis (aflA, aflB, and aflC) and the ACCase-encoding gene accA were significantly upregulated on the maize and rice substrates. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses indicated that carbon-metabolism-related genes were obviously enriched in the maize broth, and the genes involved in acetyl-CoA accumulation and consumption were up- and downregulated, respectively. Several genes involved in the regulation of AFs biosynthesis, including veA, ppoB, snf1, and the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) genes, were differentially expressed on the three substrates, suggesting that these genes may be also involved in sugar signal sensing, transfer, and regulation. Interestingly, by the correlation analyses of transcriptome and proteome, trehalose metabolism genes, aldehyde dehydrogenase gene, and tryptophan synthase gene were found to be relevant with the regulation of AFs production on different crop substrates. Taken together, the differential expressions of the AFs cluster genes, several regulatory genes, and carbon metabolism genes were involved in the comprehensive modulation of AFs production on different crop substrates."

Environmental distribution and genetic diversity of A. flavus can influence the effectiveness of atoxigenic isolates in mitigating aflatoxin contamination. However, such information has not been used to facilitate selection and deployment of atoxigenic isolates. A total of 35 isolates of A. flavus isolated from maize samples collected from three agro-ecological zones of Nigeria were used in this study. Ecophysiological characteristics, distribution and genetic diversity of the isolates were determined to identify vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs). The generated data were used to inform selection and deployment of native atoxigenic isolates to mitigate aflatoxin contamination in maize. In co-inoculation with toxigenic isolates, atoxigenic isolates reduced aflatoxin contamination in grain by > 96%. A total of 25 VCGs were inferred from the collected isolates based on complementation tests involving nitrate non-utilizing (nit(-)) mutants. To determine genetic diversity and distribution of VCGs across agro-ecological zones, 832 nit(-) mutants from 52 locations in 11 administrative districts were paired with one self-complementary nitrate auxotroph tester-pair for each VCG. Atoxigenic VCGs accounted for 81.1% of the 153 positive complementations recorded. Genetic diversity of VCGs was highest in the derived savannah agro-ecological zone (H = 2.61) compared with the southern Guinea savannah (H = 1.90) and northern Guinea savannah (H = 0.94) zones. Genetic richness (H = 2.60) and evenness (E5 = 0.96) of VCGs were high across all agro-ecological zones. Ten VCGs (40%) had members restricted to the original location of isolation, whereas 15 VCGs (60%) had members located between the original source of isolation and a distance > 400 km away. The present study identified widely distributed VCGs in Nigeria such as AV0222, AV3279, AV3304 and AV16127, whose atoxigenic members can be deployed for a region-wide biocontrol of toxigenic isolates to reduce aflatoxin contamination in maize."

Aquatic consumers encountering this material may be reduced in abundance and/or limit their feeding activity, subsequently altering organic matter breakdown rate, which is a key ecosystem process in streams. 2. We investigated the effect of the transgenic nature of senesced corn (Zea mays L. ), tissue on breakdown rates, invertebrate abundance and invertebrate community composition in nine streams draining agricultural fields over 2 years (2004–2006). We studied corn tissue modified to express protein toxins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) from four hybrid families, each with its single, stacked and non‐Bt near‐isoline. 3. In 2004, we identified two instances whereby Bt leaf litter degraded slower (67–68%) than corresponding near isolines. At one site this was associated with significantly fewer individuals of Pycnopsyche sp. , a leaf‐chewing caddisfly. In 2005–2006, no differences in breakdown were found between Bt and non‐Bt near isolines. Multivariate analysis of invertebrate communities found no difference associated with Bt treatment. 4. Principle components analysis identified important abiotic factors as explanatory variables influencing breakdown, but no interaction was found between these and Bt treatment. Breakdown was strongly related to total invertebrate abundance occurring on experimental litter bags, but this did not interact with Bt treatment across all hybrid × isoline × site combinations. 5. Synthesis and applications. Ecological interactions facilitate breakdown of allochthonous detritus, and understanding the potential disruption of these interactions is important to the management of ecosystem processes. The results from our study suggests that corn tissue breakdown is unlikely to be altered by Bt, but more so by hybrid‐ and site‐specific factors such as nutrients. Management of agricultural streams will need to consider multiple sources of stress at larger scales, such as nutrient loading and temperature, which probably overwhelm the potential for consumer mediation of ecosystem processes in these ecosystems."

Mycological analyses revealed a predominance of both Fusarium and Aspergillus in maize samples compared to other genera. The two Fusarium species most commonly isolated from maize were Fusarium verticillioides (68%) and Fusarium proliferatum (31%). Atypical isolates of F. verticillioides with some characteristics of Fusarium andiyazi but apparently closer to F. verticillioides, because the isolates were all high fumonisin producers, were also found only on preharvest maize. Study of F. verticillioides strains showed the presence of extremely high fumonisin producers in Benin with total fumonisin levels ranging from 8240 to 16,690 mg/kg. Apart from 2002-2003, Fusarium occurrence was not significantly different from one zone to another, although a slight decrease was observed from south, humid, to north, drier. Fusarium occurrence varied somewhat from one season to another. It significantly decreased over the 6 months of storage. Widespread fumonisin occurrence in maize was observed. Most of the maize samples collected were found positive for fumonisin with levels ranging from not detected to 12 mg/kg in 1999-2000, 6.7 mg/kg in 2000-2001 and 6.1 mg/kg in 2002-2003. Fumonisin levels in maize were found to be significantly higher in the two southern zones during all the surveys. The highest mean total fumonisin level was detected in 1999-2000 in maize samples from the southern Guinea Savannah (SGS) (12 mg/kg), whereas in both 2000-2001 and 2002-2003, it was in samples from the forest mosaic savannah (FMS) (6.7 and 6.1 mg/kg, respectively). Fumonisin levels varied from one season to another and, throughout the storage time, showing a decreasing trend in each zone. However, this decrease was not significant every season. An increasing trend was observed during some seasons in the SGS and northern Guinea Savannah (NGS) zones. The results of this study emphasise that farmers and consumers, not only in Benin but also in other West African countries, should be alerted to the danger of fumonisin contamination in maize."

In the present study, field and pot trials were carried out at the experimental farm of the University of Padova at Legnaro (NE Italy) in a silty-loam soil in order to investigate the effects of soil amendment with wood ash (0.1% w/w, incorporated into the 0.2-m top soil) on the bioavailability of mineral elements and their uptake by maize. Characteristics analyzed included plant growth, leaf transpiration dynamics, and productivity in two contrasting hybrids, P1921 (drought sensitive) and D24 (drought tolerant). Wood ash contained relevant amounts of Ca, K, Mg, P, and S, and hazardous levels of Zn (732 mg kg-1), Pb (527 mg kg-1), and Cu (129 mg kg-1), although no significant changes in total soil element concentration, pH, and electrical conductivity were detected in open field. Ash application led to a general increasing trend of diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA)-extractable of various elements, bringing to higher grain P in D24 hybrid, and Zn and Ni reductions in P1921 hybrid. Here, the results demonstrated that ash amendment enhanced shoot growth and the number of leaves, causing a reduction of harvest index, without affecting grain yield in both hybrids. The most relevant result was a retarded inhibition of leaf transpiration under artificial progressive water stress, particularly in the drought-tolerant D24 hybrid that could be sustained by root growth improvements in the field across the whole 0-1.5 m soil profile in D24, and in the amended top soil in P1921. It is concluded that woody ash can be profitably exploited in maize fertilization for enhancing shoot and root growth and drought tolerance, thanks to morphological and physiological improvements, although major benefits are expected to be achieved in drought tolerant hybrids. Attention should be payed when using ash derived by metal contaminated wood stocks to avoid any health risk in food uses."

Fusarium mold is a major plant pathogen and produces a number of trichothecene mycotoxins including deoxynivalenol (or vomitoxin), nivalenol, diacetoxyscirpenol, and T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin. Monogastrics are sensitive to vomitoxin, while poultry and ruminants appear to be less sensitive to some trichothecenes through microbial metabolism of trichothecenes in the gastrointestinal tract. Trichothecene mycotoxins occur worldwide however both total concentrations and the particular mix of toxins present vary with environmental conditions. Proper agricultural practices such as avoiding late harvests, removing overwintered stubble from fields, and avoiding a corn/wheat rotation that favors Fusarium growth in residue can reduce trichothecene contamination of grains. Due to the vague nature of toxic effects attributed to low concentrations of trichothecenes, a solid link between low level exposure and a specific trichothecene is difficult to establish. Multiple factors, such as nutrition, management, and environmental conditions impact animal health and need to be evaluated with the knowledge of the mycotoxin and concentrations known to cause adverse health effects. Future research evaluating the impact of low-level exposure on livestock may clarify the potential impact on immunity. Trichothecenes are rapidly excreted from animals, and residues in edible tissues, milk, or eggs are likely negligible. In chronic exposures to trichothecenes, once the contaminated feed is removed and exposure stopped, animals generally have an excellent prognosis for recovery. This review shows the occurrence of trichothecenes in food and feed in 2011-2020 and their toxic effects and provides a summary of the discussions on the potential public health concerns specifically related to trichothecenes residues in foods associated with the exposure of farm animals to mycotoxin-contaminated feeds and impact to human health.

One main problem related to consumption of fresh produce is the minimal processing, especially for leafy salads such as corn salad, rocket salad, or lettuce. In this study, we focused on lettuce ( Lactuca sativa ) which is contaminated by STM at higher rates compared to corn salad, resulting in prolonged persistence. We previously described the contribution of Saf fimbriae, type 1 secretion system (T1SS)-secreted BapA, intact LPS, and flagella-mediated motility to adhesion to corn salad leaves. We systematically analyzed factors contributing to adhesion of STM to lettuce leaves. We used the previously established reductionist, synthetic approach to identify factors that contribute to the surface binding of STM to leaves of lettuce by expressing all known adhesive structure by the Tet-on system. The analyses revealed contributions of Lpf fimbriae, Sti fimbriae, autotransported adhesin MisL, T1SS-secreted BapA, intact LPS, and flagella-mediated motility to adhesion of STM to lettuce leaves.

The numbers of outbreaks by fresh produce contaminated with gastrointestinal pathogens are increasing, and underline the relevance to human health. The mechanisms involved in the colonization of, persistence on, and transmission by fresh produce are poorly understood and have to be part of further research. Here, we investigated the contribution of adhesive factors of STM in the initial phase of plant colonization, i. e. the binding to the plant surface. Usage of a reductionist, synthetic approach including the controlled surface expression of specific adhesive structures of STM, one at a time, allowed the determination of relevant fimbrial and non-fimbrial adhesins, the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide, the flagella, and chemotaxis to binding to lettuce leaves."

Under Cu1, the concentrations of reducible Cu were significantly increased in CSC1 and CSC2, and the oxidizable Cu concentration was increased in CSC2. In conclusion, sweet corn-soybean intercropping combined with biochar 5% (w/w) is beneficial to reducing the concentration of acid-soluble Cu, and increases the concentration of oxidizable Cu in copper-contaminated soil. Under Cu1 (200 mg·kg-1), the Cu concentrations in sweet corn and soybean were lower than 10 mg·kg-1, which meets the national food safety standard of China. Under Cu2 (400 mg·kg-1), the Cu concentration in sweet corn was lower than 10 mg·kg-1, but it was higher than 10 mg·kg-1 in soybean."

This study reports the distribution, accumulation and risk assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) in soils from the Corn Belt of northeast China at a regional scale. Concentrations of PAHs, DDT and HCH were 306‐5300, 6.00–82.0 and 4.07–15.6 ng g⁻¹, respectively. Source analysis suggests PAHs were derived from regional combustion of biomass and coal, except where sites are strongly affected by local sources. The DDT and HCH residues in soils are likely to be derived from previous agricultural applications that have persisted due to slow microbiological degradation under low mean temperatures. Precipitation was only significantly correlated with PAH concentrations, suggesting that precipitation affected PAH but not DDT and HCH distributions at a regional scale. Positive correlations between DDT concentrations and total organic carbon (TOC) contents of soils suggest hydrophobic organic contaminants were associated with organic matter. In contrast, TOC contents were correlated with PAHs in alfisols but not in pedocals. Pedocals contained mainly high molecular weight PAHs, indicating that eluviation affected the accumulation of less hydrophobic organic contaminants. Different correlations between low‐molecular‐weight PAH and HCH concentrations with TOC contents were found in alfisols, suggesting that contaminant structure may also affect the accumulation of less hydrophobic organic contaminants in these soils. Risk analysis suggested that potential ecological risks related to soils in the Corn Belt may lead to reduced maize production and the potential for human health risks in the future. HIGHLIGHTS: Few studies focus on regional‐scale factors that affect organic contaminant accumulation in soils. Environmental process affects less hydrophobic organic contaminant distribution at regional scale. Precipitation and eluviation affected accumulation of less hydrophobic contaminants in soils. PAH and OCP residues in the soil of maize fields may pose ecological risks affecting future crop production and human health."

Methods A total of 130 concentrate feedstuff samples were collected in paper bags from 113 randomly selected farms in the three agroecological zones (representing high, mid and low (lakeshore) altitudes) from October and December 2019. Each feed sample was ground and analyzed for total aflatoxin and zearalenone using VICAM Fluorometer Method procedures. Results About 85% of samples comprised of corn (maize) bran (CB), 8% for pigeon pea (PP), 2% for dairy mash, 1% for soybean and <1% for sunflower, rice bran (RB) and rice bran mixed with maize bran respectively. 75% of corn bran and 100% of dairy mash and rice bran samples were positive for zearalenone (i. e. above 100 μg/kg) while other concentrates tested negative. Incidences of total aflatoxin were 32%, 67% and 9% in CB, DM and PP bran samples respectively and negligible in other concentrates. Overall, 32% and 23% of feedstuffs had total aflatoxin concentrations above regulatory limits set by Malawi’s neighboring countries (Tanzania and Mozambique) and US respectively whereas only 6% of all the concentrate feedstuffs had zearalenone concentrations above the regulatory limit enforced by EU. Levels of total aflatoxin and zearalenone in CB were not affected by agroecological zones (P=0.17 and P=0.87) respectively. Mean total aflatoxin concentration was 35.4, 28.1 and 38.2 μg/kg in High, Lakeshore and Mid agroecologies respectively whereas zearalenone concentration was 249.7, 226.8 and 243.9 μg/kg respectively. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report prevalence of various mycotoxins in dairy concentrate feedstuffs in Malawi. Aflatoxin and zearalenone contamination in dairy concentrates exist but mostly in levels within tolerable limits at least from the limited timeframe of this study. However, presence of total aflatoxin above regulatory limits in 26 - 34% of corn bran, a major concentrate feedstuff, points to the need for deliberate efforts to ensure levels are kept low in dairy animal feeds for both safety of dairy animals and consumers in Malawi."

In this study, PTE levels in maize, soil, and irrigation water were detected, and health risks through maize consumption were evaluated. Maize, soil, and irrigation water samples were collected in northern Ningxia, China. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry was applied to determine the contents of six PTEs. Bioaccumulation factor was used to reflect the transfer potential of a metal from soil to maize. Health risks associated with maize consumption were assessed by deterministic and probabilistic estimation. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine variables that pose the greatest effect on health risk results. The levels of Pb and Cr in maize exceeded the standards, while the PTE levels in soil and irrigation water did not exceed the corresponding standards. The bioaccumulation factor values of the six PTEs in maize were all lower than 1 and followed the order of Cd > Zn = As > Cr > Cu > Pb. The hazard index (0.0986) was far less than 1 for all inhabitants implying no obvious non-carcinogenic risk. The carcinogenic risk value was 3.261 × 10- 5, which was lower than the maximum acceptable level of 1 × 10- 4 suggested by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Females were at greater risk than males, and the age group of below 20 years had the greater risk among all the groups evaluated. Approximately 0.62% of inhabitants exceeded the level for non-carcinogenic risk, while 8.23% exceeded the level for carcinogenic risk. The As concentration and daily intake of maize contributed 35.8, and 29.4% for non-carcinogenic risk results as well as 61.0 and 18.5% for carcinogenic risk results. Maize was contaminated by Pb and Cr, whereas the associated soil and irrigation water were not contaminated by PTEs.

The recent rise in glyphosate application to corn and soy crops correlates positively with increased death rates due to Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Glyphosate has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier in in vitro models, but has yet to be verified in vivo. Additionally, reports have shown that glyphosate exposure increases pro-inflammatory cytokines in blood plasma, particularly TNFα. Here, we examined whether glyphosate infiltrates the brain and elevates TNFα levels in 4-month-old C57BL/6J mice. Mice received either 125, 250, or 500 mg/kg/day of glyphosate, or a vehicle via oral gavage for 14 days. Urine, plasma, and brain samples were collected on the final day of dosing for analysis via UPLC-MS and ELISAs. Primary cortical neurons were derived from amyloidogenic APP/PS1 pups to evaluate in vitro changes in Aβ40-42 burden and cytotoxicity. RNA sequencing was performed on C57BL/6J brain samples to determine changes in the transcriptome. Our analysis revealed that glyphosate infiltrated the brain in a dose-dependent manner and upregulated TNFα in both plasma and brain tissue post-exposure. Notably, glyphosate measures correlated positively with TNFα levels. Glyphosate exposure in APP/PS1 primary cortical neurons increases levels of soluble Aβ40-42 and cytotoxicity. RNAseq revealed over 200 differentially expressed genes in a dose-dependent manner and cell-type-specific deconvolution analysis showed enrichment of key biological processes in oligodendrocytes including myelination, axon ensheathment, glial cell development, and oligodendrocyte development. Collectively, these results show for the first time that glyphosate infiltrates the brain, elevates both the expression of TNFα and soluble Aβ, and disrupts the transcriptome in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that exposure to this herbicide may have detrimental outcomes regarding the health of the general population."

Therefore, mycotoxin contamination of foods and feeds results is a serious food safety issue and affects the competitiveness of US agriculture in both domestic and export markets. This article highlights research accomplished by Agricultural Research Service (ARS) laboratories on control of pre-harvest toxin contamination by using biocontrol, host-plant resistance enhancement and integrated management systems. Emphasis is placed on the most economically relevant mycotoxins, namely aflatoxins produced by Aspergillus flavus, Link, trichothecenes produced by various Fusarium spp and fumonisins produced by F verticillioides. Significant inroads have been made in establishing various control strategies such as development of atoxigenic biocontrol fungi that can outcompete their closely related, toxigenic cousins in field environments, thus reducing levels of mycotoxins in the crops. Potential biochemical and genetic resistance markers have been identified in crops, particularly in corn, which are being utilized as selectable markers in breeding for resistance to aflatoxin contamination. Prototypes of genetically engineered crops have been developed which: (1) contain genes for resistance to the phytotoxic effects of certain trichothecenes, thereby helping reduce fungal virulence, or (2) contain genes encoding fungal growth inhibitors for reducing fungal infection. Gene clusters housing the genes governing formation of trichothecenes, fumonisins and aflatoxins have been elucidated and are being targeted in strategies to interrupt the biosynthesis of these mycotoxins. Ultimately, a combination of strategies using biocompetitive fungi and enhancement of host-plant resistance may be needed to adequately prevent mycotoxin contamination in the field. To achieve this, plants may be developed that resist fungal infection and/or reduce the toxic effects of the mycotoxins themselves, or interrupt mycotoxin biosynthesis. This research effort could potentially save affected agricultural industries hundreds of millions of dollars during years of serious mycotoxin outbreaks."

They are mainly produced by fungi in the Aspergillus, Penicillium and Fusarium genera. When ingested, inhaled or absorbed through the skin, mycotoxins will cause lowered performance, sickness or death on humans and animals. Factors that contribute to mycotoxin contamination of food and feed in Africa include environmental, socio-economic and food production. Environmental conditions especially high humidity and temperatures favour fungal proliferation resulting in contamination of food and feed. The socio-economic status of majority of inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa predisposes them to consumption of mycotoxin contaminated products either directly or at various points in the food chain. The resulting implications include immuno-suppression, impaired growth, various cancers and death depending on the type, period and amount of exposure. A synergistic effect between mycotoxin exposure and some important diseases in the continent such as malaria, kwashiorkor and HIV/AIDS have been suggested. Mycotoxin concerns have grown during the last few decades because of their implications to human and animal health, productivity, economics of their management and trade. This has led to development of maximum tolerated limits for mycotoxins in various countries. Even with the standards in place, the greatest recorded fatal mycotoxin-poisoning outbreak caused by contamination of maize with aflatoxins occurred in Africa in 2004. Pre-harvest practices; time of harvesting; handling of produce during harvesting; moisture levels at harvesting, transportation, marketing and processing; insect damage all contribute to mycotoxin contamination. Possible intervention strategies include good agricultural practices such as early harvesting, proper drying, sanitation, proper storage and insect management among others. Other possible interventions include biological control, chemical control, decontamination, breeding for resistance as well as surveillance and awareness creation. There is need for efficient, cost-effective sampling and analytical methods that can be used for detection analysis of mycotoxins in developing countries."

Controversies surrounding agricultural biotechnology produced crops and foods commonly focus on human and environmental safety, intellectual property rights, consumer choice, ethics, food security, poverty reduction and environmental conservation. Originally, some consumers were reluctant to accept the first generation agricultural biotechnology products because they appeared to primarily benefit agricultural producers; however, it is clear from continued evaluations that these technologies also improved both the safety and wholesomeness of food and helped improve the environment. Plants engineered to resist insect pests and tolerate less toxic pesticides resulted in improved yields thereby enabling farmers to produce more food per acre while reducing the need for herbicides, pesticides, and water and tilling. An indirect benefit of reduced pest damage in transgenic corn expressing genes to control insect pests is lower levels of mycotoxins, most notably those caused by the genus Fusarium. Mycotoxins are an important regulatory issue globally because of their toxic and carcinogenic potential to humans and animals. Complicating this issue is the fact that toxicological databases for mycotoxins are relatively incomplete compared to other food contaminants. Current debates about agricultural biotechnology and mycotoxins reveal significant differences in perception of associated risks and benefits. When faced with uncertainty, regulators tend to set limits as low as possible. Additionally, some regulators invoke the ""Precautionary Principle"" when limited information is available or disputes over interpretation exist for possible contaminants, including mycotoxins. A major concern regarding use of the ""Precautionary Principle"" is the appearance that regulators can justify setting any limit on the basis of inconclusive or unknown potential hazards of a contaminant which may significantly impact global trade because mycotoxin residues vary widely between countries. This paper describes the current economic and heath impact of these regulations and their impact on international trade."

It is prone to oxidation by reactive oxygen species, such as ozone, leading to the formation of oxyphytosterols. A better understanding regarding the biological effects and mechanism of action of oxyphytosterols is required since the beneficial and adverse side effects of these compounds on human health remain highly controversial. In this work, we investigated the biological effects of β-Secosterol (βSec), a new oxyphytosterol generated by the reaction of βSito with ozone. Treatment of HepG2 cells with βSito or βSec (0.1-100 μM) for 24, 48, and 72 h induced a dose-dependent reduction of cell viability in the MTT assay, with βSec showing higher efficacy than βSito. However, βSec presented a lower potency than βSito, showing IC50 = 37.32 μM, higher than βSito (IC50 = 0.23 μM) at 48 h. Cell cycle analyses by flow cytometry showed a slight decrease of G0/G1 phase with βSito 0.5 μM, but a significant cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in the treatment for 48 h with βSec 20 μM (62.69 ± 2.15%, p < 0.05) and βSec 40 μM (66.96 ± 5.39%, p < 0.0001) when compared to control (56.97 ± 2.60%). No suggestion of apoptosis was indicated by flow cytometry data. Also, βSec (20 and 40 μM) reduced the mitotic index. In the laser scanning confocal microscopy analysis no alterations in cell morphology were observed with βSito (0.5 μM). Nevertheless, round-shaped cells, abnormal nuclear morphology with shrinkage, and formation of microtubules clusters were observed in the treatment with βSec, indicating a disruption in the microtubules network organization. N-acetyl-l-cysteine was not able to inhibit any of these cellular effects, indicating a lack of involvement of oxidative stress in the mechanism of action of βSec. Although not further investigated in this study, it was discussed the hypothesis that covalent adduct formation with lysine residues of proteins, could play an important role in the biological effects elicited by βSec. Elucidation of the primary cellular processes induced by βSec provides the essential knowledge to be aware of its potential adverse side effects or therapeutic use of this oxyphytosterol."

Obesity is associated with chronic inflammation that contribute to long-term complications, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We hypothesized that obesity may also influence the sensitivity to food contaminants, such as fumonisin B1 (FB1), a mycotoxin produced mainly by the Fusarium verticillioides. FB1, a common contaminant of corn, is the most abundant and best characterized member of the fumonisins family. This toxin provokes severe mycotoxicosis in animals, which leads to hepatotoxicity and alterations in the immune response and intestinal barrier permeability. We investigated here whether diet-induced obesity could modulate the sensitivity to oral FB1 exposure, with emphasis on gut health and hepatotoxicity. The metabolic effects of FB1 were assessed in obese and non-obese male C57BL/6J mice. For 15 weeks, mice received a high-fat diet (HFD) or normal chow diet (CHOW). During the last three weeks, mice were exposed or not to FB1 (10 mg/kg body weight/day) through drinking water. As expected, HFD feeding induced significant body weight gain, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis. FB1-exposed mice displayed a higher sphinganine/sphingosine ratio, a well-known FB1 biomarker of exposure, due to inhibition of ceramide synthases activity by FB1. Combined exposure to HFD and FB1 resulted in body weight loss and a decrease in fasting blood glucose level. This co-exposition also induces gut dysbiosis, an increase in plasma FB1 level, a decrease in liver weight and hepatic steatosis. Moreover, plasma transaminase levels were significantly increased and associated with liver inflammation in HFD/FB1-treated mice. Liver gene expression analysis revealed that the combined exposure to HFD and FB1 was associated with reduced expression of genes involved in lipogenesis and increased expression of immune response and cell cycle-associated genes. These results suggest that, in the context of obesity, FB1 exposure promotes gut dysbiosis and severe liver inflammation. To our knowledge, this study provides the first example of obesity-induced hepatitis in response to a food contaminant."

Therefore, it appears necessary to know and quantify factors affecting soil intake in order to ensure the food safety in outside rearing systems. Thus, soil intake was determined in two Latin square trials with 24 and 12 lactating dairy cows. In Trial 1, the effect of pasture allowance (20 v. 35 kg dry matter (DM) above ground level/cow daily) was studied for two sward types (pure perennial ryegrass v. mixed perennial ryegrass-white clover) in spring. In Trial 2, the effect of pasture allowance (40 v. 65 kg DM above ground level/cow daily) was studied at two supplementation levels (0 or 8 kg DM of a maize silage-based supplement) in autumn. Soil intake was determined by the method based on acid-insoluble ash used as an internal marker. The daily dry soil intake ranged, between treatments, from 0.17 to 0.83 kg per cow in Trial 1 and from 0.15 to 0.85 kg per cow in Trial 2, reaching up to 1.3 kg during some periods. In both trials, soil intake increased with decreasing pasture allowance, by 0.46 and 0.15 kg in Trials 1 and 2, respectively. In Trial 1, this pasture allowance effect was greater on mixed swards than on pure ryegrass swards (0.66 v. 0.26 kg reduction of daily soil intake between medium and low pasture allowance, respectively). In Trial 2, the pasture allowance effect was similar at both supplementation levels. In Trial 2, supplemented cows ate much less soil than unsupplemented cows (0.20 v. 0.75 kg/day, respectively). Differences in soil intake between trials and treatments can be related to grazing conditions, particularly pre-grazing and post-grazing sward height, determining at least in part the time spent grazing close to the ground. A post-grazing sward height lower than 50 mm can be considered as a critical threshold. Finally, a dietary supplement and a low grazing pressure, that is, high pasture allowance increasing post-grazing sward height, would efficiently limit the risk for high level of soil intake, especially when grazing conditions are difficult. Pre-grazing and post-grazing sward heights, as well as faecal crude ash concentration appear to be simple and practical tools for evaluating the risk for critical soil intake in grazing dairy cows."

Much of the popular and scientific media have already decided against fructose and calls for regulation and taxation come from many quarters. There are conflicting data, however. Outcomes attributed to fructose - obesity, high triglycerides and other features of metabolic syndrome - are not found in every experimental test and may be more reliably caused by increased total carbohydrate. In this review, we try to put fructose in perspective by looking at the basic metabolic reactions. We conclude that fructose is best understood as part of carbohydrate metabolism. The pathways of fructose and glucose metabolism converge at the level of the triose-phosphates and, therefore, any downstream effects also occur with glucose. In addition, a substantial part of ingested fructose is turned to glucose. Regulation of fructose metabolism per se, is at the level of substrate control - the lower Km of fructokinase compared to glucokinase will affect the population of triose-phosphates. Generally deleterious effects of administering fructose alone suggest that fructose metabolism is normally controlled in part by glucose. Because the mechanisms of fructose effects are largely those of a carbohydrate, one has to ask what the proper control should be for experiments that compare fructose to glucose. In fact, there is a large literature showing benefits in replacing total carbohydrate with other nutrients, usually fat, and such experiments sensibly constitute the proper control for comparisons of the two sugars. In terms of public health, a rush to judgement analogous to the fat-cholesterol-heart story, is likely to have unpredictable outcome and unintended consequences. Popular opinion cannot be ignored in this problem and comparing fructose to ethanol, for example, is without biochemical correlates. Also, nothing in the biochemistry suggests that sugar is a toxin. Dietary carbohydrate restriction remains the best strategy for obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The specific contribution of the removal of fructose or sucrose to this effect remains unknown."

Knowing the contamination in advance can help to reduce food safety risks and related health issues and economic losses. The current study aimed to develop forecasting models for the contamination of maize grown in Serbia with aflatoxins and fumonisins. An integrated modeling approach was used, linking mechanistic modeling with artificial intelligence, in particular Bayesian network (BN) modeling. Two of such combined models, i. e. , the prediction model for aflatoxins (PREMA) and for fumonisins (PREFUM) in maize, were developed. Data used for developing PREMA were from 867 maize samples, collected in Serbia during the period from 2012 to 2018, of which 190 were also used for developing PREFUM. Both datasets were split randomly in a model training set and a model validation set. With corresponding geographical and meteorological data, the so-called risk indices for total aflatoxins and total fumonisins were calculated using existing mechanistic models. Subsequently, these risk indices were used as input variables for developing the BN models, together with the longitudes and latitudes of the sites at which the samples were collected and related weather data. PREMA and PREFUM were internally and externally validated, resulting in a prediction accuracy of PREMA of, respectively, 83 and 70%, and of PREFUM of 76% and 80%. The capability of PREMA and PREFUM for predicting aflatoxins and fumonisins contamination using data from the early maize growth stages only was explored as well, and promising results were obtained. The integrated approach combining two different modeling techniques, as developed in the current study, was able to overcome the obstacles of unbalanced data and deficiency of the datasets, which are often seen in historical observational data from the food safety domain. The models provide predictions for mycotoxin contamination at the field level; this information can assist stakeholders of the maize supply chain, including farmers, buyers/collectors, and food safety authorities, to take timely decisions for improved mycotoxin control. The developed models can be further validated by applying them into practice, and they can be extended to other European maize growing areas."

Morphological assessments showed an irregular shape of the ovaries in DEP-treated mice as compared to the control. The average bodyweight of DEP-intoxicated mice (p ≤ 0.05) increased notably against control, while DEP plus coffee group showed a regular gain in the average weight of mice. The gonado-somatic index showed non-significant variations among all groups. Micrometric studies showed that the diameter of secondary follicles (115 µm) in the ovaries of DEP-exposed mice (p ≤ 0.001) decreased significantly as compared to control (204 µm); conversely, follicular diameter in the coffee control group (248) increased significantly. Serum FSH and LH levels were significantly increased in DEP-exposed mice with a noteworthy decrease in estrogen level while hormonal levels of all other groups were comparable to control. Histological sections of DEP-exposed mice ovaries showed anatomical disruptions contrary to other groups, which were comparable with control. Antioxidant potential was checked in ovaries homogenates; FRAP values showed a notable decrease in DEP group in comparison with the control group, in contrast to G-V, when DEP was co-administrated with coffee.

The SWAT was applied to 27 watersheds, largely within the midwest corn belt of the United States, ranging from 20 to 386 km2 , and evaluated using consistent input data sets and an uncalibrated parameterization approach. The watersheds were selected from the Atrazine Ecological Exposure Monitoring Program and the Heidelberg Tributary Loading Program, both of which contain high temporal resolution atrazine sampling data from watersheds with exceptionally high vulnerability to atrazine exposure. The model performance was assessed based upon predictions of annual maximum atrazine concentrations in 1-d and 60-d durations, predictions critical in pesticide-threatened and endangered species risk assessments when evaluating potential acute and chronic exposure to aquatic organisms. The simulation results showed that for nearly half of the watersheds simulated, the uncalibrated SWAT model was able to predict annual maximum pesticide concentrations within a narrow range of uncertainty resulting from atrazine application timing patterns. An uncalibrated model's predictive performance is essential for the assessment of pesticide exposure in flowing water bodies, the majority of which have insufficient monitoring data for direct calibration, even in data-rich countries. In situations in which SWAT over- or underpredicted the annual maximum concentrations, the magnitude of the over- or underprediction was commonly less than a factor of 2, indicating that the model and uncalibrated parameterization approach provide a capable method for predicting the aquatic exposure required to support pesticide regulatory decision making.

Significant differences in FGSC composition were observed among these habitats (P<0.001). Most strikingly, F. meridionale and F. cortaderiae of the NIV genotype accounted for the vast majority (>96%) of isolates from corn stubble, whereas F. graminearum with the 15-ADON genotype was dominant (>84%) among isolates from diseased wheat kernels. Potential differences in pathogenic fitness on wheat were also suggested by a greenhouse competitiveness assay in which F. graminearum was recovered at much higher frequency (>90%) than F. meridionale from four wheat varieties inoculated with an equal mixture of F. graminearum and F. meridionale isolates. Taken together, the data presented here suggest that FGSC composition and, consequently, the trichothecene contamination in wheat grown in southern Brazil is influenced by host adaptation and pathogenic fitness. Evidence that F. meridionale and F. cortaderiae with the NIV genotype are regionally significant contributors to FHB may have significant implications for food safety and the economics of cereal production."

The carcinogenic risk of heavy metals was related to the intake of crops. Residents in the study area ingest rice, wheat, and corn on a daily basis. On the basis this study, it is suggested that local governments should pay attention to the carcinogenic risk of heavy metals in rice."

This study was to investigate the immunotoxicity of malathion (MLT）on BALA/c mice for the purpose of providing a scientific basis for pesticides registration management of MLT and other pesticides. Methods Female mice were randomly divided into five groups. Both the negative control and the positive control groups of mice were daily gavage with corn oil, and those in the positive control group were intraperitoneal injected with 200 mg/kg bw of cyclophosphamide (CY) 24 h before the end of the study. In the dosage groups, MLT were daily gavage at doses of 16, 65 and 258 mg/kg bw for 30 days, respectively. After exposure, the body weight, the absolute and relative weight of organs, the hematology and clinical chemistry parameters, the splenocyte number, the bone marrow cell classification, histopathology, as well as the cellular immunity, humoral immunity, and non-specific immunity functions of mice were studied. Comparisons between multiple groups were carried out by using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc comparisons tests when equal variances assumed and Dunnett’s T3 post hoc tests when equal variances assumption was not met. ResultsCompared with the negative control group, the low dose of MLT significantly reduced the levels of IL-10, neutrophil, polychromatic erythroblast and monocyte series ( P <0.05)，induced atrophy in white pulp of spleen (1/10), which showed an immunosuppression in mice，and increased the absolute and relative weight of thymus ( P <0.05). Inhibition of the PFC response, liver injury and thymus atrophy were observed in the high-dose group. What’s more, the IgG level was abnormally elevated with the increase of dose and presented a dose-response relation ( P <0.05). ConclusionsThe immunotoxicity of low-dose of MLT is clear from the evidence and the LOAEL of MLT is preliminarily considered to be 16 mg/kg bw. It is much lower than that of the NOAEL (29 mg/kg bw) based on a 2-year chronic toxicity test and carcinogenicity test in rats, which was used to derive the ADI by Joint WHO/FAO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (0.3 mg/kg bw). It indicates that the immune system is a more sensitive target of MLT toxicity."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of regional differences in feeding systems on the composition, fatty acid content, and flavor of pasteurized milk at the farm level. Nine dairy farms using grass silage (GS), 6 farms using maize silage (MS), and 4 farms using by-products (BP) as the characteristic feed components were chosen for this survey. Fresh milk was sampled once per month from September 2008 to February 2009 at each dairy farm. The percentages of GS, MS, and BP (soybean curd residue or brewer's grain) in the feed were 32.4, 22.1, and 15.1%, respectively. The milk fat, protein, and lactose contents did not differ among the milks from farms with different feeding systems. Fatty acids with chain lengths of less than C16 and saturated fatty acids were present at higher concentrations in the milks from the GS and MS farms than in the milk from the BP farms; conversely, fatty acids with chain lengths greater than C18 and unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), including mono- (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), were present at higher concentrations in the milks from the BP farms than in the milks from the GS farms. No significant differences were detected in milk flavor, evaluated as sweetness, body, texture, aftertaste, and palatability, between the milks from the farms with different feeding systems. The proportion of BP in the cow's diet was positively correlated with the concentrations of fatty acids with chain lengths greater than C18 and with UFA, MUFA, and PUFA. In contrast, the proportion of GS in the diet was positively associated with the levels of milk fat, protein, fatty acids with chain lengths less than C16, and SFA. The MUFA, PUFA, UFA, and fatty acids with chain lengths greater than C18 were not associated with any of the milk flavors. These results suggest the regional differences in feeding systems contribute to the differences in the fatty acid compositions of milk at the farm level. However, these differences do not influence the flavor of pasteurized milk. Thus, more specific feed profiles will be required to provide a specific regional flavor to pasteurized milk."

Regulatory agencies such as the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA), and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) all use mathematical exposure models in their regulatory assessment process. Brazil has been discussing the adoption of the Pesticide in Water Calculator (PWC) to be applied in aquatic pesticide risk assessment. Therefore, a qualitative sensitivity analysis (Morris OAT method) was performed to understand which are the most important local parameters in the PWC to estimate environmental concentrations in surface water (EECSW ). In addition, an exercise made up of two corn scenarios in two Brazilian regions was developed (Uberlândia [UDI] and Arapoti [ARA]). Two herbicides with different soil-binding properties and modes of action were selected to estimate the EECSW. The results demonstrated that the parameters of importance were different for each site, probably the result of different soil characteristics and meteorological patterns. This outcome suggests that regulatory agencies should consider developing more than one scenario to account for different agricultural regions. For Herbicide 1, the EECSW for UDI were similar to US scenarios, whereas for ARA they were lower. For Herbicide 2, the EECSW for the UDI site was higher than most of the US scenarios, whereas at the ARA site, EECs were similar to four US scenarios and lower than the other six. Local data were used as a refinement, resulting in the decrease in the EECSW for both herbicides in the UDI site. For the ARA site, Herbicide 1 displayed a similar EECSW value, whereas for Herbicide 2, it was lower after the refinement. Overall, these results demonstrated the importance of developing local scenarios to provide more realism to estimate pesticide exposure from its agricultural use and may help regulators to determine and recommend mitigations regarding the use of crop-protection products.

There is accumulating evidence that insecticides adversely affect non-target wildlife species, including birds, causing mortality, reproductive impairment, and indirect effects through loss of prey base, and the type and magnitude of such effects differs by chemical class, or mode of action. In evaluating data for an insecticide registration application and for registration review, scientists at the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) assess the fate of the insecticide and the risk the insecticide poses to the environment and non-target wildlife. Current USEPA risk assessments for pesticides generally rely on endpoints from laboratory based toxicity studies focused on groups of individuals and do not directly assess population-level endpoints. In this paper, we present a mechanistic model, which allows risk assessors to estimate the effects of insecticide exposure on the survival and seasonal productivity of birds known to forage in agricultural fields during their breeding season. This model relies on individual-based toxicity data and translates effects into endpoints meaningful at the population level (i. e. , magnitude of mortality and reproductive impairment). The model was created from two existing USEPA avian risk assessment models, the Terrestrial Investigation Model (TIM v.3.0) and the Markov Chain Nest Productivity model (MCnest). The integrated TIM/MCnest model was used to assess the relative risk of 12 insecticides applied via aerial spray to control corn pests on a suite of 31 avian species known to forage in cornfields in agroecosystems of the Midwest, USA. We found extensive differences in risk to birds among insecticides, with chlorpyrifos and malathion (organophosphates) generally posing the greatest risk, and bifenthrin and λ-cyhalothrin (pyrethroids) posing the least risk. Comparative sensitivity analysis across the 31 species showed that ecological trait parameters related to the timing of breeding and reproductive output per nest attempt offered the greatest explanatory power for predicting the magnitude of risk. An important advantage of TIM/MCnest is that it allows risk assessors to rationally combine both acute (lethal) and chronic (reproductive) effects into a single unified measure of risk."

For the purpose of identification and quantification of citrinin, high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) with fluorescence was used (Calibration curve k > 0.999; Intra assay CV = 2.1%; Inter assay CV = 4.3%; LOQ < 1 μg/kg). From the area of Međimurje County, 10 samples of corn and 10 samples of wheat were analyzed. None of the samples contained Citrinin (<1 μg/kg).

From 5 analyzed samples from Brod-Posavina County, one of the samples contained citrinin in the amount of 23.8 μg/kg, while the registered amounts in the other samples were <1 μg/kg. The results show that grains from several Counties contain certain amounts of Citrinin possibly indicating a significant intake of citrinin in humans. It must be stated that grains and grain-based products are the basis of everyday diet of all age groups, especially small children, where higher intake of citrinin can occur. Consequently, we emphasize the need for systematic analysis of larger amount of samples, from both large grains and small grains, especially in the area of Brod-Posavina County, in order to obtain more realistic notion of citrinin contamination of grains and to asses the health risk in humans."

To complete an appropriate risk assessment, data on treated seed toxicity need to be combined with information about the risk of exposure of birds in the field and the factors that modulate such exposure. We studied the abundance of pesticide‐treated seeds available for birds in the field, the pesticides and their concentrations in treated seeds, and the bird species observed in the field that were feeding on these pesticide‐treated seeds. The exposure of red‐legged partridge to treated winter cereal seeds was characterized through the analysis of crop and gizzard contents of hunted individuals (n = 189). Moreover, we measured the contribution of cereal seeds in the autumn–winter diet of partridges in order to assess the potential risk of exposure to pesticide‐treated seeds. Density of treated seeds on the soil surface after sowing (11·3 ± 1·2 seeds m⁻² in the centre of field and 43·4 ± 5·5 seeds m⁻² in the headlands) was enough to provide, in an area between 6 and 50 m², doses of six active ingredients above those indicating acute (i. e. a dose capable of killing 50% of individuals of a sensitive species) and / or chronic (no observed effect level) toxicity. Up to 30 bird species were observed consuming treated cereal seeds in recently sown fields. Corn bunting was identified as an appropriate focal passerine species for the risk assessment of pesticide‐treated seeds. We found that treated seeds were an important route of pesticide ingestion for red‐legged partridge; pesticide residues (six fungicides and two insecticides) were found in 32·3% of crops and gizzards. Cereal seeds represented more than half (53·4 ± 4·3%) of total biomass consumed by partridges from October to February. Synthesis and applications. The field exposure data combined with previous studies about the toxicity to partridges of using pesticide‐treated seeds point to an unacceptable risk of this practice to farmland birds.

Methods In this study, samples of soil, irrigation water, and maize crops were collected from the Yellow River irrigation area in northern Ningxia, China. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry(ICP-AES)was applied to determine the heavy metal contents in maize grains, soil samples, and irrigation water. Potential health risks were assessed by deterministic and probabilistic estimation. Results The average concentrations of chromium and lead in maize exceeded the maximum allowable concentrations in food. The average concentrations of metals in the associated soil and irrigation water were both below the safe limits allowed in China. Deterministic estimation indicated a hazard index of 0.0986 for all inhabitants, implying no significant non-carcinogenic risk.

Probabilistic estimation indicated that approximately 0.62% of inhabitants are exposed to non-carcinogenic risk due to maize ingestion, while carcinogenic risk exceeds the maximum acceptable level (1×10−4) for 8.23% and negligible level (1×10−5) for 64.26% of inhabitants. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the concentration of arsenic in maize, the daily intake of maize, and exposure frequency of maize are the primary contributing factors in both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks. Therefore, the content of arsenic in maize is of concern in the study region. Conclusions Based on deterministic and probabilistic risk estimation, there are no obvious non-carcinogenic health risks to inhabitants, while carcinogenic risk from As exposure is higher than the acceptable risk level.

Therefore, the function identify_safety_hazards() will return an empty dictionary.</s>","The attacks of pests and diseases and the presence of weeds make it necessary to apply pesticides to olive trees to ensure crop protection. Residues of these compounds may remain and contaminate the oil produced. For the analysis of pesticide residues in olive oil, the most common methods are multiresidue methods for fatty substrates, based on partitioning between hexane or light petroleum and acetonitrile. Recently, other methods have been applied, such as ready-to-use, disposable minicolumns or direct injection of oil into a capillary gas chromatograph equipped with a precolumn with an oil recovery tank. Although several pesticides are registered in oil-producing countries for use on olive trees, available literature on the level and fate of residues is very limited. However, it is clear that fat-soluble pesticides tend to concentrate in the oil, both after full coverage and bait spraying, and their use close to harvest should therefore be avoided. Because it is sometimes necessary to use such pesticides late in autumn because of their effectiveness in cases of severe attack, residue trials should be carried out to determine the residue concentration in oil and to set a reasonable preharvest safety interval. Data produced by such trials would permit the establishment of MRLs (tolerances) in olive oil to cover cases where the residues, although relatively high, are not of toxicological significance for consumers (risk assessment). Such is the case with corn oil and the fat-soluble insecticide methyl pirimiphos, registered in the U. S. for use on corn. The U. S. EPA tolerance for methyl pirimiphos in corn is 8 mg/kg, whereas it is 11 times higher (88 mg/kg) for corn oil because it is known to concentrate in the oil. Similar provisions for olive oil, based on data from residue trials according to Good Agricultural Practice, the long-term toxicity of each pesticide as expressed by its ADI for man, and olive oil consumption patterns, would facilitate international trade of this commodity. On the other hand, because of the high dietary and health value of olive oil, it is desirable that toxic pesticide residues be kept as low as possible. Therefore, it would be preferable not to rely only on chemical pest control treatments but to develop and apply alternative plant protection techniques such as Integrated Pest Management (IPM).

Potency, and population risks ranged 0.087-0.38 μg kg-1 bw day-1, 1.5-6.9, 0.0087-0.38, 3.64-12.09, 0-0.0396 ng Aflatoxins kg-1 bw day-1 and, 3.5 × 10-1-0.015 respectively for total aflatoxins. While ranges for aflatoxins B1 (AFB1) recorded were 0.068-0.3 μg Kg bw-1 day-1, 2.43-10.64, 0.0068-0.030, 4.73-20.51, 0-0.0396 ng Aflatoxins kg-1 bw day-1 and, 2.69 × 10-3-0.012 for Estimated Daily Intake (EDI), Hazard Quotient (H.

Current evidence of the incidence of Aspergillus flavus isolates belonging to vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) lacking the ability to produce aflatoxins (i. e. , atoxigenic) in Ghana may lead to the development of an aflatoxin biocontrol strategy to mitigate crop aflatoxin content. In this study, 12 genetically diverse atoxigenic African A. flavus VCGs (AAVs) were identified from fungal communities associated with maize and groundnut grown in Ghana. Representative isolates of the 12 AAVs were assessed for their ability to inhibit aflatoxin contamination by an aflatoxin-producing isolate in laboratory assays. Then, the 12 isolates were evaluated for their potential as biocontrol agents for aflatoxin mitigation when included in three experimental products (each containing four atoxigenic isolates). The three experimental products were evaluated in 50 maize and 50 groundnut farmers' fields across three agroecological zones (AEZs) in Ghana during the 2014 cropping season. In laboratory assays, the atoxigenic isolates reduced aflatoxin biosynthesis by 87-98% compared to grains inoculated with the aflatoxin-producing isolate alone. In field trials, the applied isolates moved to the crops and had higher (P < 0.05) frequencies than other A. flavus genotypes. In addition, although at lower frequencies, most atoxigenic genotypes were repeatedly found in untreated crops. Aflatoxin levels in treated crops were lower by 70-100% in groundnut and by 50-100% in maize (P < 0.05) than in untreated crops. Results from the current study indicate that combined use of appropriate, well-adapted isolates of atoxigenic AAVs as active ingredients of biocontrol products effectively displace aflatoxin producers and in so doing limit aflatoxin contamination. A member each of eight atoxigenic AAVs with superior competitive potential and wide adaptation across AEZs were selected for further field efficacy trials in Ghana. A major criterion for selection was the atoxigenic isolate's ability to colonize soils and grains after release in crop field soils. Use of isolates belonging to atoxigenic AAVs in biocontrol management strategies has the potential to improve food safety, productivity, and income opportunities for smallholder farmers in Ghana."

Dictionary: {}</s>","{'rice': ['Cercospora species', 'Cercospora beticola']}</s>","Species in the genus Cercospora cause economically devastating diseases in sugar beet, maize, rice, soy bean and other major food crops. Here we sequenced the genome of the sugar beet pathogen C. beticola and found it encodes 63 putative secondary metabolite gene clusters, including the cercosporin toxin biosynthesis ( CTB ) cluster. We show that the CTB gene cluster has experienced multiple duplications and horizontal transfers across a spectrum of plant pathogenic fungi, including the wide host range Colletotrichum genus as well as the rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Although cercosporin biosynthesis has been thought to-date to rely on an eight gene CTB cluster, our phylogenomic analysis revealed gene collinearity adjacent to the established cluster in all CTB cluster-harboring species. We demonstrate that the CTB cluster is larger than previously recognized and includes cercosporin facilitator protein ( CFP ) previously shown to be involved with cercosporin auto-resistance, and four additional genes required for cercosporin biosynthesis including the final pathway enzymes that install the unusual cercosporin methylenedioxy bridge. Finally, we demonstrate production of cercosporin by Colletotrichum fioriniae , the first known cercosporin producer within this agriculturally important genus. Thus, our results provide new insight into the intricate evolution and biology of a toxin critical to agriculture and broaden the production of cercosporin to another fungal genus containing many plant pathogens of important crops worldwide. Species in the fungal genus Cercospora cause diseases in many important crops worldwide. Their success as pathogens is largely due to the secretion of cercosporin during infection. We report that the cercosporin toxin biosynthesis ( CTB ) cluster is ancient and was horizontally transferred to diverse fungal pathogens on an unprecedented scale. Since these analyses revealed genes adjacent to the established CTB cluster, we evaluated their role in C. beticola to show that four are necessary for cercosporin biosynthesis. Finally, we confirmed that the apple pathogen Colletotrichum fioriniae produces cercosporin, the first case outside the family Mycosphaerellaceae. Other Colletotrichum plant pathogens also harbor the CTB cluster, which points to a wider concern that this toxin may play in virulence and human health."

Deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEN) are among the most important Fusarium mycotoxins, but little is known about the occurrence of their modified forms in forage maize. To assess the mycotoxin contamination in Northern Germany, 120 natural contaminated forage maize samples of four cultivars from several locations were analysed by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) for DON and ZEN and their modified forms deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside (DON3G), the sum of 3- and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3+15-AcDON), α- and β-zearalenol (α-ZEL, β-ZEL). DON and ZEN occurred with high incidences (100 and 96%) and a wide range of concentrations, reaching levels up to 10,972 and 3910 µg/kg, respectively. Almost half of the samples (46%) exceeded the guidance value in complementary and complete feeding stuffs for ZEN (500 µg/kg), and 9% for DON (5000 µg/kg). The DON related mycotoxins DON3G and 3+15-AcDON were also present in almost all samples (100 and 97%) with amounts of up to 3038 and 2237 µg/kg and a wide range of concentrations. For the ZEN metabolites α- and β-ZEL lower incidences were detected (59 and 32%) with concentrations of up to 423 and 203 µg/kg, respectively. Forage maize samples were contaminated with at least three co-occurring mycotoxins, whereby 95% of all samples contained four or more mycotoxins with DON, DON3G, 3+15-AcDON, and ZEN co-occurring in 93%, together with α-ZEL in 57% of all samples. Positive correlations were established between concentrations of the co-occurring mycotoxins, especially between DON and its modified forms. Averaged over all samples, ratios of DON3G/DON and 3+15-AcDON/DON were similar, 20.2 and 20.5 mol%; cultivar-specific mean ratios ranged from 14.6 to 24.3 mol% and 15.8 to 24.0 mol%, respectively. In total, 40.7 mol% of the measured DON concentration was present in the modified forms DON3G and 3+15-AcDON. The α-ZEL/ZEN ratio was 6.2 mol%, ranging from 5.2 to 8.6 mol% between cultivars. These results demonstrate that modified mycotoxins contribute substantially to the overall mycotoxin contamination in forage maize. To avoid a considerable underestimation, it is necessary to analyse modified mycotoxins in future mycotoxin monitoring programs together with their parent forms."

Therefore, there is a requisite to propose suitable mitigation strategies to reduce the contamination of fungi and mycotoxins in agricultural commodities. In the present study, combinational inhibitory effect of Hedychium spicatum L. essential oil (HSEO) and radiation was established on growth rate, production of deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA) by Fusarium graminearum in maize grains. The HSEO was obtained from rhizomes by hydrodistillation technique and chemical composition was revealed by GC-MS analysis. A total of 48 compounds were identified and major compounds were 1,8-cineole (23.15%), linalool (12.82%), and β-pinene (10.06%). The discrete treatments of HSEO and radiation were effective in reducing the fungal growth rate and mycotoxins content, and the complete reduction was noticed at 3.15 mg/g of HSEO and 6 kGy of radiation. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to evaluate the combinational inhibitory effect of HSEO and radiation treatments on fungal growth rate and mycotoxins content. A total of 13 experiments were designed with distinct doses of HSEO and radiation by central composite design (CCD) of Stat-Ease Design-Expert software. In combinational approach, complete reductions of fungal growth, DON, and ZEA content were noticed at 1.89 mg/g of HSEO and 4.12 kGy of radiation treatments. The optimized design concluded that combinational treatments of HSEO and radiation were much more effective in reducing the fungal growth and mycotoxins content compared to their discrete treatments (p < 0.05). Responses of the design were assessed by second-order polynomial regression analysis and found that quadratic model was well fitted. The optimized design has larger F-value and adequate precision, smaller p-value, decent regression coefficients (R2 ) and found statistically significant (p < 0.05). In addition, correlation matrix, normal plot residuals, Box-Cox, and actual vs. predicted plots were endorsed that optimized design was accurate and appropriate. The proposed combinational decontamination technique could be highly applicable in agriculture and food industry to safeguard the food and feed products from fungi and mycotoxins."

This study is focused on high concentrations of Tl in soils in the Lanmuchang area of southwest Guizhou, China, which is related to natural processes of Tl-rich sulfide mineralization. Thallium contents range from 40 to 124 mg/kg in soils originating from the mining area, from 20 to 28 mg/kg in slope wash materials, from 14 to 62 mg/kg in alluvial deposits downstream, from 1.5 to 6.9 mg/kg in undisturbed natural soils and <0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg Tl in soils from the background area. These values indicate that both the erosion of natural soils from the Tl mineralized area and the mining activity are responsible for the distribution of high Tl concentrations in soils. Two other important toxic metals of interest, mercury and arsenic, also show high contents in soils, and are generally higher than Tl concentrations. Thallium concentration in plants exhibit species-dependent preferences. Thus, the enrichment of Tl in the edible parts of crop species decreases in the following order: green cabbage>carrot>chili>Chinese cabbage>rice>corn. The highest level of Tl in green cabbage is up to 500 mg/kg as dry wt. , surpassing the values of Tl in the soils in which the green cabbages grow. In contrast, Hg and As are relatively less concentrated in local plants. The average daily uptake of Tl by the villagers of the Lanmuchang area through consumption of locally planted crops has been estimated to be 1.9 mg/person, which is 50 times the daily ingestion of individuals from the Tl-free background area. The daily ingestion of As and Hg from the study area are 0.03 and 0.01 mg, respectively. This indicates that Tl in the contaminated soils related to the natural Tl mineralization is being readily transferred to the human body through the food chain, and poses a significant threat to the health of the local villagers. Arsenic may pose a lesser health hazard, but mercury has an insignificant health risk. This study illustrates a real environmental concern related to land use and human health in areas containing high contents of Tl in soils associated with the natural occurrence of Tl-rich sulfides and coals, with or without mining activities. Thallium contamination in soils should be a critical parameter for proper land use and health related environmental planning and regulations."

A clinical evaluation and risk factor survey were conducted. Patients with an abnormal ACR (≥30 mg/g) or a low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (≤75 mL/min/1.73 m2) were re-evaluated and a renal ultrasound (US) was obtained.

The prevalence of persistent albuminuria was 3.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-5.3]. Only one patient had a decreased GFR. None of the patients with persistent albuminuria had anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract by renal US. Patients with persistent albuminuria had a decreased total renal volume compared with the control group (150 versus 195 mL/m2; P < 0.01). Eighteen kidney biopsies were performed; 72% had glomerulomegaly and only one patient had mild fibrosis.

Risk factors for persistent albuminuria were: homestead proximity to maize crops, the use of pesticides at the father's workplace, a family history of CKD and blood pressure abnormalities. The body mass index and breastfeeding were protective factors. The prevalence of persistent albuminuria in adolescents in Aguascalientes is high and histologic compromise is characterized by podocyte injury in the absence of fibrosis.

A total of 27 research works were reviewed after screening 52 articles for subject matter relevancy, including dumpsites, industrially polluted soils, inorganically fertilized soils, mining sites, smelting sites, municipal wastewater irrigated soils, and a battery waste dumpsite. Among the reviewed sites, concentrations of Cd and Cr were highest at a tin mining site, where prolonged mining, mineral processing and other production activities contributed heavy metal pollution in the soil. The soil at a battery waste dumpsite exhibited the highest Pb concentration, while the soil at a Zn smelting site presented the highest concentration of Zn. The highest soil Cu concentration was found in an area where sewage irrigation had been carried out over a long period. The BAF of the five heavy metals in Zea mays increased with the metal concentrations in the soil. The BAF of Cd, Cr, Pb, Cu, and Zn in Zea mays from the study areas fall within the ranges of 0-0.95, 0-1.89, 0-1.20, 0.011-0.99, and 0.03-0.99, respectively. Cadmium and Zn had the highest bioconcentration factors values in maize plants, likely due to their higher mobility rate compared to the other heavy metals. The study concluded that Zea mays is capable of accumulating high amounts of heavy metals, although accumulation of these heavy metals is influenced by multiple factors including soil texture, cation exchange capacity, root exudation and especially soil pH and chemical forms of the heavy metals.

AFs tend to contaminate a wide range of foods which is a serious and recurring food safety problem worldwide. Currently, immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC) has become the most conventional sample clean-up method for determining AFs in foodstuffs. However, IAC method is limited in the large-scale food analysis because it requires the use of expensive disposable cartridges and the IA procedure is time-consuming. Herein, to achieve the cost-effective determination of AFs in edible oils, we developed a promising solid-phase extraction (SPE) method based on commercially available humic acid-bonded silica (HAS) sorbent, followed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) analysis. In HAS-SPE, AFs can be captured by the HAS sorbent with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, whereas the oil matrix was captured only with the hydrophobic interactions. The oil matrix can be sufficiently washed off with isopropanol, while the AFs were still retained on the SPE packing, thus achieving selective extraction of AFs and clean-up of oil matrices. Under the optimal conditions of HAS-SPE, satisfactory recoveries ranging from 82% to 106% for four AFs (B1, B2, G1, and G2) were achieved in various oil matrices, containing blended oil, tea oil, rapeseed oil, peanut oil, sunflower seed oil, corn oil, blended olive oil, rice oil, soybean oil, and sesame oil.

Moreover, the LODs of AFs between 0.012 and 0.035 μg/kg completely meet the regulatory levels fixed by the EU, China or other countries. The methodology was further validated for assaying the naturally contaminated peanut oils, and consistent results between the HAS-SPE and the referenced IAC were obtained. In addition, HAS-SPE can directly treat diluted oil sample without liquid-liquid extraction and is automatable, thus making it simple and convenient for the large-scale determination of AFs in edible oils. Using this method, we successfully detected four AFs in the naturally contaminated peanut oils, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report about the determination of AFs in edible oils using HA-based SPE."

In the ancient times, food security was achieved through gathering of fruits, grains, herbs, tubers, and roots from the forests by individual households. Advancements in human civilization led to domestication of crops and a need to save food for not only a household, but the nation. This extended need for food security led to establishment of national reservoirs for major produces and this practice varies greatly in different states. Each of the applied food production, handling and storage approaches has got its benefits and challenges. In sub-Saharan Africa, several countries have a public funded budget to subsidize production costs, to buy grains from farmers and to store the produce for a specific period and/or until the next harvests. During the times of famine, the stored grains are later given free to the citizens. If there is no famine, the grain is sold to retailers and/or processors (e. g. , millers) who later sell it to the consumers. This approach works well if the produce (mainly grain) is stored under conditions that do not favor growth of molds, as some of these could contaminate the grain with toxic and carcinogenic metabolites called mycotoxins. Conditions that alleviate contamination of grains are required during production, handling and storage. Most of the grain is produced by smallholder farmers under sub-optimal conditions, which make vulnerable to colonization and contamination by toxigenic fungi. Further, the grain is stored in silos at large masses, where it is hard to monitor the conditions at different points of these facilities, and hence it becomes vulnerable to additional contamination. Production and storage of grain under conditions that favor mycotoxins poses major food health and safety risks to humans and livestock who consume the grain. This concept paper focuses on how establishment of local grain production and banking system (LGPBS) could enhance food security and safety in East Africa. The concept of LGPBS provides an extension of advisory and finance support within warehouse receipting system to enhance grain production under optimal conditions. The major practices at the LGPBS, and how each could contribute to food security and safety are discussed. While the concept paper gives more strength on maize production and safety, similar practices could be applied to enhance safety of other grains in the same LGPBS."

In this study, we quantified co-occurring mycotoxins in breast milk and food samples from Haryana, India, and characterized determinants of exposure. Deterministic risk assessment was conducted for mothers and infants. We examined levels of eight mycotoxins (Aflatoxin B1 , B2 , G1 , G2 , M1 , M2 ; Ochratoxin A, B) in 100 breast milk samples (infants 2-4 months) using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1 ), fumonisin B1 (FB1 ) and deoxynivalenol (DON) were detected in several food items (n = 298) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. We report novel data on the presence of mycotoxins in breast milk samples from India. Whereas breast milk concentrations (AFM1 median: 13.7; range: 3.9-1200 ng/L) remain low, AFM1 was detected above regulatory limits in 27% of animal milk samples. Additionally, 41% of infants were above provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) limits for AFM1 due to consumption of breast milk (mean: 3.04, range: 0.26-80.7 ng kg-1 bw day-1 ). Maternal consumption of breads (p < 0.05) was associated with breast milk AFM1 exposure. AFB1 (μg/kg) was detected in dried red chilies (15.7; 0-302.3), flour (3.13; 0-214.9), groundnuts (0; 0-249.1), maize (56.0; 0-836.7), pearl millet (1.85; 0-160.2), rice (0; 0-195.6), wheat (1.9; 0-196.0) and sorghum (0; 0-63.5).

The capacities for Cd accumulation in different maize cultivars are, however, not fully understood. To reduce human health risk from maize grown in Cd-contaminated soil and to provide promising maize cultivars for the phytoremediation of Cd-polluted soil, a field experiment was conducted to screen low-Cd- and high-Cd-accumulation maize cultivars by evaluating the yield, Cd uptake, translocation, and accumulation differences among 19 maize cultivars. There were differences in straw dry weight (DW), root DW, and yield among the 19 cultivars. The cultivars Yudan19, Zhengda999, and Xianyu508 had a higher production compared to that of the other cultivars. The Cd concentrations in the roots were much higher than those in the straws and grains in all cultivars. The Cd accumulation factors (AFS) decreased in the order of accumulation factors in root (AFrs) > accumulation factors in straw (AFss) > accumulation factors in grain (AFgs). The Cd translocation factors (TFs) from root to straw (TFrs) were significantly (p < 0.05) larger than those from straw to grain (TFsg) among all of the cultivars. The TFs for all of the cultivars was less than 1, and the lowest TFsg (0.23) was found in cultivar Xiangyongdan3. The correlation analysis indicated that Cd concentrations in straws showed a significant (p < 0.01) as well as positive correlation with TFrs while a negative correlation with TFsg (p < 0.01). Moreover, Cd accumulation in different tissues decreased in the order straw > grain > root. Among the 19 maize cultivars, Jixiang2118 and Kangnong18 accumulated the highest Cd amount in the aboveground tissues, and the corresponding values were 7,206.51 and 6,598.68 mg hm(-2), respectively. A hierarchical cluster analysis based on the Cd concentrations in grains and straws classified the 19 maize cultivars into four and two groups for a 0.4 minimum distance between clusters, respectively. Yudan19, Zhengda999, and Xianyu508 can be classified into one group in which low Cd in grains meeting the Cd tolerance limit in foods set by China National Standard, suggesting that those cultivars are safety for food and human health.

Aflatoxins remain a scourge in the country, unprecedentedly reducing the value of agricultural foods and in high enough exposure levels, implicated for hepatocellular carcinoma, stunted growth in children and untimely deaths. This review synthetizes the country’s major findings in relation to the mycotoxin’s etiology, epidemiology, detection, quantification, exposure assessment, control and reduction in different matrices. It also highlights some of the management strategies for aflatoxin control that could be adopted in Uganda. Review results indicate that aflatoxins in Uganda is majorly produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus and have been reported in maize ( Zea mays L. ), sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor L. ), sesame ( Sesamum indicum ), beans ( Phaseolus vulgaris L. ), sunflower ( Helianthus annus ), millet ( Eleusine coracana) , a bovine milk-based product, peanuts ( Arachis hypogaea L. ) and cassava ( Manihot esculenta ) with the highest content reported in cassava, beans and peanuts. The causes and proliferation of aflatoxigenic contamination of Ugandan foods have been largely due to poor pre-, peri- and post-harvest activities, poor government legislation, lack of awareness and low levels of education among farmers, agri-entreprenuers and consumers on the plague. Aflatoxin B 1 is the most prevalent aflatoxin in Uganda. There is still limited research on aflatoxins in Uganda because the surveillance, reduction and control carry prohibitive costs. A few exposure assessments have been done especially in human sera and dependence on a single or a related set of foods with little diet diversity has exacerbated the risk of exposure to aflatoxins in Uganda because most of the staple foods are aflatoxin-prone. On the detection, control and reduction, these are still marginal, though some devoted scholars have devised and validated a sensitive portable device for on-site aflatoxin detection in maize as well as shown that starter cultures used for making some cereal-based beverages have the potential to bind aflatoxins. More effort should be geared towards awareness creation through training of farmers and traders in the cereal value chain as well as developing capacity to monitor aflatoxins.

EU legislation already exists for the aflatoxins, ochratoxin A and patulin in food, and legislation will come into force for deoxynivalenol, zearalenone and the fumonisins in 2007. To enforce the various legal limits, it would be preferable to determine all mycotoxins by routine analysis in different types of matrices in one single extract. This would also be advantageous for HACCP control purposes. For this reason, a multi-method was developed with which 33 mycotoxins in various products could be analysed simultaneously. The mycotoxins were extracted with an acetonitrile/water mixture, diluted with water and then directly injected into a LC-MS/MS system. The mycotoxins were separated by reversed-phase HPLC and detected using an electrospray ionisation interface (ESI) and tandem MS, using MRM in the positive ion mode, to increase specificity for quality control. The following mycotoxins could be analysed in a single 30-min run: Aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2, ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, alpha-zearalenol, alpha-zearalanol, beta-zearalanol, sterigmatocystin, cyclopiazonic acid, penicillic acid, fumonisins B1, B2 and B3, diacetoxyscirpenol, 3- and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol, zearalanone, ergotamin, ergocornin, ergocristin, alpha-ergocryptin, citrinin, roquefortin C, fusarenone X, nivalenol, mycophenolic acid, alternariol and alternariol monomethyl ether. The limit of quantification for the aflatoxins and ochratoxin A was 1.0 microg kg(-1) and for deoxynivalenol 50 microg kg(-1). The quantification limits for the other mycotoxins were in the range 10-200 microg kg(-1). The matrix effect and validation data are presented for between 13 and 24 mycotoxins in peanuts, pistachios, wheat, maize, cornflakes, raisins and figs. The method has been compared with the official EU method for the determination of aflatoxins in food and relevant FAPAS rounds. The multi-mycotoxin method has been proven by the detection of more than one mycotoxin in maize, buckwheat, figs and nuts. The LC-MS/MS technique has also been applied to baby food, which is subject to lower limits for aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A, ergot alkaloids in naturally contaminated rye and freeze-dried silage samples."

To resolve those problems, rice straw, wheat straw, corn stalk, corncob, soybean stalk, and soybean hull were selected as denitrification carbon sources to investigate the release mechanisms and potential influences of the organic matter, secondary pollutants, and DOM. The results showed that the six agricultural wastes could be used as the denitrification carbon source. The carbon content in the wheat straw was the highest and the secondary pollution risk from the corncob was the lowest. For the six carbon sources, the second-order kinetic equation and Ritger-Peppas equation were followed during the 1-120 h carbon release process. The fitting results demonstrated that corncob was more suitable for use as the denitrification carbon source because of its moderate cm value and longer t1/2 value, and the release mechanisms of the six types of carbon sources were mainly controlled by the diffusion process. The NH4+-N, TN, and TP contents in the immersion water of the rice straw were higher than those of the five other agricultural wastes, and there was heavy chromaticity in the immersion water of the wheat straw and corn stalk. The amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and chromatic substances released from the corncob were the lowest. The leachates of the corncob and soybean hull had higher biodegradability and lower risks of secondary pollution than those of the other sources. The aromaticity and molecular weight of DOM increased as the reaction time increased, and the humification of DOM was low. Five components were identified by PARAFAC. The main component was protein-like matter, which was mainly composed of tyrosine-like and tryptophan-like substances. There was less humic acid-like matter in the immersion water. The component characteristics of DOM might have had an adverse effect on the subsequent water treatment process. These results could provide theoretical support for the impact on effluent water quality and risk assessment when the agricultural wastes are used as an additional denitrification carbon source at the start-up stage."

The perceived consumer value of PJ is due in large part to its potential health benefits based on a significant body of medical research conducted with authentic PJ. To establish criteria for authenticating PJ, a new International Multidimensional Authenticity Specifications (IMAS) algorithm was developed through consideration of existing databases and comprehensive chemical characterization of 45 commercial juice samples from 23 different manufacturers in the United States. In addition to analysis of commercial juice samples obtained in the United States, data from other analyses of pomegranate juice and fruits including samples from Iran, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Syria, India, and China were considered in developing this protocol. There is universal agreement that the presence of a highly constant group of six anthocyanins together with punicalagins characterizes polyphenols in PJ. At a total sugar concentration of 16 degrees Brix, PJ contains characteristic sugars including mannitol at >0.3 g/100 mL. Ratios of glucose to mannitol of 4-15 and of glucose to fructose of 0.8-1.0 are also characteristic of PJ. In addition, no sucrose should be present because of isomerase activity during commercial processing. Stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry as > -25 per thousand assures that there is no added corn or cane sugar added to PJ. Sorbitol was present at <0.025 g/100 mL; maltose and tartaric acid were not detected. The presence of the amino acid proline at >25 mg/L is indicative of added grape products. Malic acid at >0.1 g/100 mL indicates adulteration with apple, pear, grape, cherry, plum, or aronia juice. Other adulteration methods include the addition of highly concentrated aronia, blueberry, or blackberry juices or natural grape pigments to poor-quality juices to imitate the color of pomegranate juice, which results in abnormal anthocyanin profiles. To adjust the astringent taste of poor-quality juice or peel extract, addition of nonpomegranate sugars is a commonly detected adulteration method. The profile generated from these analyses combined with information from existing databases and published literature has been integrated into a validated IMAS for PJ, which can be utilized to detect PJ adulteration.

Various formulations of chlorpyrifos have been developed to maximize stability and contact with pests and minimize human exposure. From corn agriculture in the United States to termite control in Japan to cotton agriculture in Egypt to citrus horticulture in Spain, chloropyrifos has been successfully employed to combat insect and other arthropod pests threatening the production of food and fiber and maintenance of human health. Due to the nonpolar nature of the chlorpyrifos molecule, it possesses a low water solubility (< 2 ppm) and great tendency to partition from aqueous into organic phases in the environment (log P of 4.7-5.3). It is characterized by an average soil and sediment sorption coefficient (Koc) of 8498 and aquatic bioconcentration factor of 100-5100 in fish. As a result of its high propensity for sorption, its movement through and over the soil profile is limited. It has been found to be relatively immobile vertically in soil and has not proved to be a groundwater contaminant. Surface runoff and erosion mobility are also low, and, in general, less than 0.3% of soil surface application has been observed to move even under the heaviest simulated precipitation conditions. Chlorpyrifos has an intermediate vapor pressure (2 x 10(-5) mm Hg, 25 degrees C), and under some conditions volatility is a significant mechanism of dissipation. This is especially true for plant foliage, from which it is the major means of loss, to some extent from water surfaces, and to a lesser degree from moist soil surfaces. Chlorpyrifos is a degradable compound, and both abiotic and biotic transformation processes effect its degradation within environmental compartments (Fig. 1). In all cases, the major pathway of transformation involves cleavage of the phosphate ester bond to form 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP). Hydrolytic transformation, although relatively slow in pure water under ideal conditions (half-lives of 29-74 d at pH 7, 25 degrees C), may be catalyzed under certain environmental conditions. These include alkaline conditions in water (pH > or = 8) and alkaline (pH > or = 7.5) and air-dry conditions in soil, and in some soils hydrolysis may be the major means of dissipation (Fig. 2).

Drought stress-responding compounds such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) are associated with fungal stress responsive signaling and secondary metabolite production, and can stimulate the production of aflatoxin by A. flavus in vitro. These secondary metabolites have been shown to possess diverse functions in soil-borne fungi including antibiosis, competitive inhibition of other microbes, and abiotic stress alleviation. Previously, we observed that isolates of A. flavus showed differences in oxidative stress tolerance which correlated with their aflatoxin production capabilities. In order to better understand these isolate-specific oxidative stress responses, we examined the transcriptional responses of field isolates of A. flavus with varying levels of aflatoxin production (NRRL3357, AF13, and Tox4) to H2O2-induced oxidative stress using an RNA sequencing approach. These isolates were cultured in an aflatoxin-production conducive medium amended with various levels of H2O2. Whole transcriptomes were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq platform with an average of 40.43 million filtered paired-end reads generated for each sample. The obtained transcriptomes were then used for differential expression, gene ontology, pathway, and co-expression analyses. Isolates which produced higher levels of aflatoxin tended to exhibit fewer differentially expressed genes than isolates with lower levels of production. Genes found to be differentially expressed in response to increasing oxidative stress included antioxidant enzymes, primary metabolism components, antibiosis-related genes, and secondary metabolite biosynthetic components specifically for aflatoxin, aflatrem, and kojic acid. The expression of fungal development-related genes including aminobenzoate degradation genes and conidiation regulators were found to be regulated in response to increasing stress. Aflatoxin biosynthetic genes and antioxidant enzyme genes were also found to be co-expressed and highly correlated with fungal biomass under stress. This suggests that these secondary metabolites may be produced as part of coordinated oxidative stress responses in A. flavus along with antioxidant enzyme gene expression and developmental regulation."

For the calculation of pesticide concentrations it is necessary to provide an application date which has to match the specific Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundesamt, Chemische Industrie (BBCH) stage at which the pesticide shall be applied. If these application dates are not available for a specific stage, crop and country they must be estimated, which adds an additional uncertainty to the predicted concentrations. In the present study, we therefore evaluate to which extent application dates can be derived from phenological data. For this analysis phenological data, converted to BBCH stages, of two field crops provided by the German Weather Service (DWD) were analyzed. We found a linear correlation between BBCH stages and the respective appearance dates, which can be used for interpolation of appearance dates of specific BBCH stages. Remarkably, when comparing BBCH stages from Germany and the Czech Republic almost identical correlations of appearance dates and BBCH stages were found. In the next step, soil and climate data from Joint Research Centre (JRC) were analyzed together with phenological data in order to evaluate if BBCH stages can be estimated for countries with other climate or soil conditions. This analysis revealed that temperature, global radiation and evaporation were the parameters with the strongest impact. These parameters were used for estimating appearance dates of BBCH stages for other countries. Exemplarily, appearance dates for maize BBCH were calculated for Italy. Estimated and observed appearance dates showed a high concordance (on average six days difference). Finally, the political of impact a variation of a few days on calculated pesticide concentration was analyzed. Exemplarily, the pesticide fate model FOCUS PEARL was used to estimate pesticide groundwater concentrations. When calculating concentrations for application dates varying by ± two weeks, concentrations in groundwater usually varied very little. The highest variation was found for application at BBCH 30 in maize (6.6 % variation over all scenarios). These results showed that the uncertainty included in the estimation of appearance dates of BBCH stages for other countries has a relatively small effect on the results of PEARL and consequentially on the decision of the pesticide risk assessment by changing only the application date."

Furthermore, the potential ecological risks of the four heavy metals in soils and crops were evaluated using the potential ecological risk index (RI). The potential health risks to adults and children induced by the intake of these heavy metals through consumption of crops were evaluated using the hazard quotient (HQ). The results showed that:①The farmlands in the zinc-smelting area were contaminated by heavy metals; the most polluted farm land was corn fields followed by paddy fields and wheat fields. The order of the heavy metal concentrations was Cd > Cu > Zn > Pb. The Nemero index of corn fields was higher than the threshold value of heavy pollution and was higher than that of the paddy and wheat fields. Cd contributed most to the integrated pollution index. ②The very high ecological risk was posed by Cd followed by Pb, Cu, and Zn. The results of the potential ecological risk assessment showed that 1.41% of the sites were classified as low risk, 21.1% classified as medium risk, 35.2% as high risk, and 42.3% as extremely high risk. ③The average concentrations of Pb, Cd, Zn, and Cu in rice were 0.145, 0.017, 16.97, and 2.704 mg·kg-1, respectively.

Silage and compound feed were the main diet ingredients, representing on average 67 and 23% of dry matter intake, respectively. Deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone, roquefortine C, and mycophenolic acid were the mycotoxins with the highest incidence. The incidence of DON in silage, compound feed, and feed commodity samples was 38 to 54%. The incidence of zearalenone in silage, compound feed, and feed commodity samples was 17 to 38%. The DON and zearalenone had a low incidence in forage samples and were not detected in ensiled by-product samples.

However, EOs are water-insoluble and have unpleasant sensory properties, and strategies are needed to prepare colloidal systems for dispersion in liquid products and increase their antimicrobial activity and therefore reduce their usage level. In the present study, the overall objective was to fabricate and characterize self-emulsified nanoemulsions containing multiple EOs with synergistic antibacterial activities. Cinnamon, lemongrass, oregano, and tea tree EOs were observed to have synergistic antibacterial activities when used in combinations, especially for their triple combinations showing the fractional inhibitory concentration index of 0.625 and below. When triple EOs were emulsified by the combination of sunflower lecithin and Tween 20, mixing EOs with corn oil enabled the preparation of translucent oil-in-water nanoemulsions by simply stirring the mixtures. Three formulations were chosen for the preparation of self-emulsified nanoemulsions as these systems remained translucent, the droplet diameter remained to be smaller than 200 nm, and the polydispersity index remained to be smaller than 0.3 after 180-day ambient storage at 21 °C. The oil: surfactant mass ratio in these nanoemulsions (1.16 or higher) was higher than that of EO microemulsions (up to 0.77) prepared with a similar method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the nanoemulsions remained to be 0.5 or 1.0 mg/mL against S. aureus, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) remained to be 1.0 or 2.0 mg/mL after the 180-day storage. A higher EO: surfactant mass ratio of nanoemulsions resulted in a lower MIC and MBC. When tested in whole milk with 3.3% fat at 21 °C, no inhibition of S. aureus was observed for nanoemulsions at overall EO levels of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/mL; at an overall EO concentration of 7.5 mg/mL, no inhibition was observed for one nanoemulsion with the lowest EO:(corn oil + surfactant) mass ratio, while the gradual reduction of S. aureus by ~1 or 2 log CFU/mL in 120 h was observed for the other two nanoemulsions.

Recurring and increasing studies on AF ingestion incidents indicate that AF contamination is a serious food safety issue worldwide. Currently, immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC) has become the most conventional sample clean-up method for determining AFs in foodstuffs. However, the IAC method may be limited to some laboratories because it requires the use of expensive disposable cartridges and the IA procedure is time-consuming. Herein, to achieve the cost-effective determination of AFs in edible oils, we developed a dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) clean-up method based on humic acids (HAs), which is followed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. HAs could be directly used as a DSPE sorbent after simple treatment without any chemical modification. In the HA-DSPE, AFs could remain on the HA sorbent by both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, whereas the oil matrix was retained on HA via only hydrophobic interactions. The oil matrix could be sufficiently washed off by n-hexane, whereas the AFs could still be retained on HA; thus, the selective extraction of AFs and clean-up of oil matrices were achieved. Under the optimal conditions of HA-DSPE, satisfactory recoveries ranging from 81.3% to 106.2% for four AFs (B1, B2, G1, and G2) were achieved in various oil matrices i. e. blended oil, mixed olive oil, tea oil, sunflower seed oil, rapeseed oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, rice oil, corn oil, and peanut oil. Minor matrix effects ranging from 89.3% to 112.9% were obtained for the four AFs, which were acceptable. Moreover, the LODs of AFs between 0.063 and 0.102 μg kg-1 completely meet the regulatory levels fixed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Union (EU), China, or other countries. The proposed methodology was further validated using a naturally contaminated peanut oil, and the results indicated that the accuracy of the HA-DSPE could match the accuracy of the referenced IAC. In addition, HA-DSPE can be used to directly treat diluted edible oil without liquid-liquid extraction and HA is cheap and can be easily obtained from the market worldwide; these advantages make the proposed methodology simple, low-cost, and accessible for the determination of AFs in edible oils."

Human exposure to AFs can occur in utero, via breast milk, through weaning foods, and throughout an individual's lifetime. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to AFs in early life through diet is a contributing factor to immune suppression, micronutrient deficiency, possible vaccine interference, and impaired growth in children. However, these results remain inconsistent and inconclusive due to lack of randomized controlled studies. A randomized school-based cross-sectional study was designed to study AF exposure levels and associated health effects in children between ages 6 and 12 years. Participants were recruited from primary schools within Siaya and Makueni Counties of Kenya, East Africa. The Joint Ethics Committee of the University of Nairobi and Kenyatta National Hospital in Kenya approved the research protocol and procedures for the study. Both parental consent and child assent were obtained before enrollment in the study. Parents were requested to provide household grain samples and fill out questionnaires detailing their sociodemographic information, household dietary patterns, farming practices, and knowledge of AF contamination. Blood samples were collected from children participants, and sera were prepared for analysis of AFB1-lysine which is one of the validated biomarkers for AF exposure. This protocol describes a school-based, cross-sectional study whose objective is to comparatively evaluate the role of AF exposure on adverse health outcomes in children. Specifically, effects of cumulative AF exposure on nutritional status, immune markers, and growth parameters will be assessed. This study is not a clinical trial, rather a cross-sectional study aimed at providing baseline data on AF exposures in children who live in presumably high versus low AF exposure regions.

The metal transfer was highly effective from soil to the growing plants i. e. brinjal, red corn, wheat, tomato, and spinach than other plant species. Among the metals, Cr, Ni, Mn, and Pb in plant samples were exceeding the WHO/FAO safe limit. Health risk index (HRI) have revealed the possible potential risk of heavy metal contaminated plant species in the order of spinach (6.4) > wheat (6.4) > brinjal (5.9) > tomato (4.7) > red corn (4.5) > apple gourd (4.3) > white corn (3.8) > cabbage (3.1) > luffa (2.9). Likewise, HRI of different metals was calculated as Cu (19.6) > Zn (17.9) > Cr (2.95) > Ni (0.85) > Mn (0.48) > Fe (0.15) > Cd (0.11) > Pb (0.05) > As (0.00001). The level of HRI through the use of dietary plants revealed an elevated risk level than the acceptable limit (HRI > 1) for Cu > Zn > Cr in adults. Our findings suggest that there would be a serious health risk to the consumers due to the consumption of these plant species being irrigated with the wastewater. Therefore, a strict regulatory mechanism is proposed for the safety of food plants in the study area including monitoring and recycling of crop plants, and building water treatment plants to remove pollutants and clean wastewater."

The total amounts of these 8 heavy metal elements in the samples were measured, and the health risk posed by their accumulation in rice was evaluated using the health risk evaluation model recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). The mean contents of Cd, Ni, Cu, Zn, Hg, and As in soil exceeded the background levels (0.17, 37.3, 30.7, 83.6, 0.077, and 12.3 mg kg-1, respectively) of Hubei Province, and Cd showed the highest enrichment coefficient. The concentration of Cd in 89.1% of samples exceeded the limit values stipulated in the Soil Environmental Quality Risk Control Standard for Soil Contamination of Agricultural Land (Trial) (GB15618-2018). The contents of heavy metals showed dissimilar geographical distribution patterns. The principal component analysis (PCA) results indicated that Cd, Zn, Ni, As, and Cu mainly originated from the application of pesticides and fertilizers; Cr mainly originated from soil texture and pedogenesis; exhaust gas generated during transportation was the point pollution source of Pb; livestock wastewater, manure irrigation, and atmospheric deposition were the main pollution source of Hg. The contents of Ni and Cd in 52.2% and 58.7% of the rice samples, respectively, exceeded the limit values stipulated in the Food Safety National Standards for Contaminants in Foods (GB2762-2017), and the average effective Cd content accounted for 81.9% of the total Cd. The average bioconcentration factor of each heavy metal in rice followed the order Cd >Zn >Hg >As >Ni >Cr >Pb. Cd and As were the main noncarcinogenic contributing factors, accounting for 80.8% of the total noncarcinogenic risk. The carcinogenic risk indexes of Cd, As, and Cr exceeded the risk index threshold of 10-4, indicating a carcinogenic risk to the human body.

However, frequency of outbreaks linked to the consumption of fresh or minimally processed food of nonanimal origin is increasing. New infection routes of S. enterica by vegetables, fruits, nuts, and herbs have to be considered. This leads to special interest in S. enterica interactions with leafy products, e. g. , salads, that are mainly consumed in a minimally processed form. The attachment of S. enterica to salad is a crucial step in contamination, but little is known about the bacterial factors required and mechanisms of adhesion. S. enterica possesses a complex set of adhesive structures whose functions are only partly understood. Potentially, S. enterica may deploy multiple adhesive strategies for adhering to various salad species and other vegetables. In this study, we systematically analyzed the contributions of the complete adhesiome, of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and of flagellum-mediated motility of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (STM) in adhesion to Valerianella locusta (corn salad). We deployed a reductionist, synthetic approach to identify factors involved in the surface binding of STM to leaves of corn salad, with particular regard to the expression of all known adhesive structures, using the Tet-on system. This work reveals the contribution of Saf fimbriae, type 1 secretion system-secreted BapA, an intact LPS, and flagellum-mediated motility of STM in adhesion to corn salad leaves. IMPORTANCE Transmission of gastrointestinal pathogens by contaminated fresh produce is of increasing relevance to human health. However, the mechanisms of contamination of, persistence on, and transmission by fresh produce are poorly understood. We investigated the contributions of the various adhesive structures of STM to the initial event in transmission, i. e. , binding to the plant surface. A reductionist system was used that allowed experimentally controlled surface expression of individual adhesive structures and analyses of the contribution to binding to leave surfaces of corn salad under laboratory conditions. The model system allowed the determination of the relative contributions of fimbrial and nonfimbrial adhesins, the type 3 secretion systems, the O antigen of lipopolysaccharide, the flagella, and chemotaxis of STM to binding to corn salad leaves. Based on these data, future work could reveal the mechanism of binding and the relevance of interaction under agricultural conditions."

The use of D4 as a direct ingredient in personal care products has declined significantly over the past 20 years, although it may be present as a residual impurity in a variety of consumer products. D5 is still used as an intentional ingredient in cosmetics, consumer products and in dry cleaning. Persons who may be exposed include occupational exposure for workers, and potential inhalation or dermal exposure for consumers and the general public. Because of the diverse use, especially of D5, and the potential for human exposure, a comprehensive program was undertaken to understand the kinetics, metabolism, enzyme induction and toxicity of D4 and D5 in rats following relevant routes of exposure. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models utilizing these studies have been reported for D4 and D5 in the rat and human following dermal and inhalation exposures, with the oral uptake component of the model being limited in its description. Data from high dose oral studies in corn oil and simethicone vehicles and neat were used in the D4/D5 harmonized PBPK model development. It was uncertain if the inability to adequately describe the oral uptake was due to unrealistic high doses or unique aspects of the chemistry of D4/D5. Low dose studies were used to provide data to refine the description of oral uptake in the model by exploring the dose dependency and the impact of a more realistic food-like vehicle. Absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME) of D4 and D5 was determined following a single low oral gavage dose of 14C-D4 and 14C-D5 at 30 and 100mg/kg body weight (bw), respectively, in a rodent liquid diet. Comparison of the low vs. high dose oral gavage administration of D4 and D5 demonstrated dose-dependent kinetic behavior. Data and modeling results suggest differences in metabolism between low and high dose administration indicating high dose administration results in or approaches non-linear saturated metabolism. These low dose data sets were used to refine the D4/D5 multi-route harmonized PBPK model to allow for a better description of the disposition and toxicokinetics of D4/D5 following oral exposure. With a refined oral uptake description, the model could be used in risk assessment to better define the internal dose of D4 and D5 following exposure to D4 and D5 via multiple routes."

They directly or indirectly enter aquatic and terrestrial environments through application, accidental release, contaminated soil/sediments, or atmospheric fallouts. When present in excess, ZnO NPs can induce phytotoxicity and reduce plant growth and yields. ZnO NPs can also cause Zn accumulation in edible parts of food crops, and then subsequently enter human bodies and pose a significant health risk. Arbuscular mycorrhizae are ubiquitous symbiotic associations in nature formed between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and most higher plants in terrestrial ecosystems. In addition to their well-known contribution to plant nutrient acquisition and growth, AM fungi can improve plant tolerance to various environmental stresses, but mycorrhizal effects vary with environmental conditions such as phosphorus status in both soil and plants. AM fungi have been shown to alleviate the negative effects of ZnO NPs and zinc accumulation in plants, however, the role of phosphorus fertilization has been neglected. A greenhouse pot culture experiment was conducted using maize as the test plant inoculated with or without AM fungus Funneliformis mosseae. Four levels of phosphorus (0, 20, 50 or 100 mg·kg-1) and two levels of ZnO NPs (0 or 500 mg·kg-1) were applied to pots. Shoots and roots were harvested separately after two months of growth. Mycorrhizal infection, plant biomass, P and Zn concentrations and uptake in plants, and soil DTPA-extractable zinc and pH were determined. The results showed that ZnO NPs did not significantly affect the growth of maize, but inhibited root mycorrhizal infection and plant phosphorus uptake, and led to the accumulation of zinc in plants. ZnO NPs and high phosphorus supply decreased root mycorrhizal infection, but AM inoculation significantly promoted plant growth under all phosphorus supply levels. Phosphorus application and AM inoculation increased soil pH, but reduced the bioavailability of Zn derived from ZnO NPs, decreased the translocation and accumulation of zinc in maize shoots, and thus produced beneficial effects on plants. In general, AM inoculation showed positive mycorrhizal effect, especially under low phosphorus conditions and addition of ZnO NPs. Our results showed for the first time that both AM fungi and phosphate fertilizer could help to mitigate soil pollution and the ecological and health risks posed by ZnO NPs."

The heavy metal concentrations in crops were further detected, and the non-carcinogenic health risks in the study area were evaluated using the probabilistic risk assessment method, as to provide a theoretical basis for the treatment, prevention, and control of heavy metal pollution in farmland soil in Luancheng. According to the results, ω(Cd), ω(Cr), ω(Cu), ω(Pb), and ω(Zn) in the soils were 0.06-1.08, 22.14-473.47, 12.83-150.74, 10.75-577.72, and 62.23-652.78 mg·kg-1, which exceeded the standard with over-standard rates reaching 1.83%, 1.22%, 0.61%, 0.61%, and 1.22%, respectively. Further, Cd and Pb were transported into crops, in which Cd concentrations exceeded the standard in some corn samples, and Cd and Pb concentrations exceeded the standard in some wheat samples. The total non-carcinogenic health risks (TTHQ) to the human body caused by the consumption of heavy metals in corn grown in the study area were all less than 1, with no obvious negative effects, and TTHQ was higher than 1 in wheat, increasing the likelihood of negative impacts on the human body. With the influence of the distribution of pollution-related enterprises in the industrial zone, heavy metal concentrations were higher in the south, west, and middle directions of the study area. Among them, the study area soil was slightly contaminated by Cd (Level 1). Cd and Hg had a slight potential ecological risk (Level 2), whereas other heavy metals had low potential ecological risk (Level 1). In general, most of the surface cultivated soil was not obviously polluted by heavy metals in the study area. According to the PMF results and survey, we speculated that soil heavy metals mainly came from soil parent material (52.05%), artificial pollution sources (historical sewage irrigation and industrial manufacture) (32.98%), and atmospheric deposition (14.97%).

Oral exposure to biodiesels is a concern because of contact during refuelling, accidental ingestion and exposure through ground water contamination. Although biodiesels from various feedstock are in use commercially and experimentally, very little is known about their potential adverse effects and no data is available on their potential for ground water contamination. A study was performed on male rats following oral treatment with experimental biodiesels (dissolved in corn oil) derived from canola oil (Bio-C), soy oil (Bio-S) and fish oil (Bio-F), at 500 mg/kg body weight/day, 5 days per week, for 4 weeks. Separate groups of animals were treated with low sulfur diesel (LSD) for comparison purpose, and with corn oil alone to serve as control. The potential for ground water contamination by biodiesels was investigated by the preparation of water-accommodated fractions (WAF) followed by gas chromatographic analysis. WAF from Bio-F and Bio-S was found to have the highest level of dichloromethane extractable materials. Gas chromatographic analysis indicated that the extractable materials from biodiesels contained much higher proportion of C15-C30 materials than LSD. Increased liver weight was observed in animal treated with Bio-C, Bio-S and LSD and decreased thymus weight was found in those treated with Bio-S. Histopathological changes typical of male-rat specific hyaline-droplet nephropathy were detected in kidney tubules of animals treated with LSD, Bio-S and Bio-C. Mild adaptive changes were observed in thyroids of animals treated with LSD, Bio-S and Bio-F. Clinical chemical and biochemical changes were confined to Bio-S and LSD treated rats and included elevation in some hepatic phase-I and phase-II drug metabolizing enzymes and hepatic palmitoyl Co-A oxidase, and elevated urinary concentrations of ascorbic acid and albumin. At the given dose level of 500 mg/kg bw/day, the overall treatment-related effects of biodiesels and LSD are mild, and the severity of the treatment effects may be ranked as: LSD>Bio-S>Bio-C>Bio-F.

The aim of the study was to determine whether NEW could replace sodium hypochlorite in the fresh-cut produce industry. The effects of NEW, applied in different concentrations, at different treatment temperatures and for different times, in the reduction of the foodborne pathogens Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7 and against the spoilage bacterium Erwinia carotovora were tested in lettuce. Lettuce was artificially inoculated by dipping it in a suspension of the studied pathogens at 10(8), 10(7) or 10(5) cfu ml(-1), depending on the assay. The NEW treatment was always compared with washing with deionized water and with a standard hypochlorite treatment. The effect of inoculum size was also studied. Finally, the effect of NEW on the indigenous microbiota of different packaged fresh-cut products was also determined. The bactericidal activity of diluted NEW (containing approximately 50 ppm of free chlorine, pH 8.60) against E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, L. innocua and E. carotovora on lettuce was similar to that of chlorinated water (120 ppm of free chlorine) with reductions of 1-2 log units. There were generally no significant differences when treating lettuce with NEW for 1 and 3 min. Neither inoculation dose (10(7) or 10(5) cfu ml(-1)) influenced the bacterial reduction achieved. Treating fresh-cut lettuce, carrot, endive, corn salad and 'Four seasons' salad with NEW 1:5 (containing about 50 ppm of free chlorine) was equally effective as applying chlorinated water at 120 ppm. Microbial reduction depended on the vegetable tested: NEW and sodium hypochlorite treatments were more effective on carrot and endive than on iceberg lettuce, 'Four seasons' salad and corn salad. The reductions of indigenous microbiota were smaller than those obtained with the artificially inoculated bacteria tested (0.5-1.2 log reduction). NEW seems to be a promising disinfection method as it would allow to reduce the amount of free chlorine used for the disinfection of fresh-cut produce by the food industry, as the same microbial reduction as sodium hypochlorite is obtained. This would constitute a safer, 'in situ', and easier to handle way of ensuring food safety."

The results of those studies were often difficult to interpret, because only one GE plant was compared to one related non-GE control. In such a setting, effects of the Cry proteins cannot be distinguished from plant background effects, in particular when the test species is nutritionally stressed. In the present study, we tested the suitability of three different maize materials, i. e. , flour, leaves and pollen, from five diverse non-GE maize lines (including EXP 258, a breeding line that is closely related to a SmartStax Bt maize) as exclusive food sources for D. magna. The parameters recorded included survival, sublethal endpoints such as body size, number of moltings to first offspring, time to first offspring, number of individuals in first clutch, total number of clutches, total number of offspring, average number of offspring per clutch, and population measures such as net reproductive rate R0, generation time T and intrinsic rate of increase rm. The results showed that D. magna can survive, grow and reproduce when fed only maize materials, although the performance was poorer than when fed algae, which indicates nutritional stress. Large differences in life table and population parameters of D. magna were observed among the different maize lines. Our results suggest that confounding effects caused by nutritional stress and plant background might explain some of the conflicting results previously published on the effects of Bt crops on D. magna. Using 95% confidence intervals for the means of the five maize lines for all measured parameters of D. magna performance in our study, we captured the natural range of variation. This information is useful for the interpretation of observed differences in D. magna performance between a GE plant and its non-GE comparator as it helps judging whether observed effects are of biological relevance. If differences between a GE and comparator line are observed and their biological relevance needs to be assessed in future risk assessments of GE maize, 1) the data on natural variation of the different parameters generated by previous studies can be informative (e. g. data from our study for maize fed D. magna); 2) for additional experiments the inclusion of multiple unrelated non-GE comparators should be considered; In addition, it should be taken into account that nutritional stress can affect the outcome of the study."

In developing countries regulatory measures are either lacking or poorly enforced, due to food insecurity, resulting in an increased mycotoxin exposure.

Our objectives were to determine the antifungal effect of kefir fermented milk on Aspergillus flavus AFUNL5 in vitro and to study if the addition of kefir fermented milk to arepas could produce shelf life improvement. We determined the antifungal effect on solid medium of kefir cell-free supernatants (CFS) obtained under different fermentation conditions. Additionally, we compared the antifungal effect of kefir CFS with that obtained with unfermented milk artificially acidified with lactic plus acetic acids (lactic and acetic acids at the same concentration determined in kefir CFS) or with hydrochloric acid. Finally, kefir was added to the corn products either in the loaf recipe (kefir-baked arepas) or sprayed onto the baked-loaf surface (kefir-sprayed arepas). The loaves' resistance to natural and artificial fungal contamination and their organoleptic profiles were studied. The highest fungal inhibition on solid medium was achieved with kefir CFS produced by kefir grains CIDCA AGK1 at 100 g/L, incubated at 30 °C and fermented until pH 3.3. Other CFS obtained from different fermentation conditions achieved less antifungal activity than that mentioned above. However, CFS of milk fermented with kefir grains, until pH 4.5 caused an increase of growth rates. Additionally, CFS produced by kefir grains CIDCA AGK1 at 100 g/L, incubated at 30 °C and fermented until pH 3.3 achieved higher antifungal activity than CFS from artificially acidified milk with organic acids (CFS L + A) at the same concentration of kefir CFS. Besides, CFS from milk acidified with hydrochloric acid (CFS HCl) showed no fungal inhibition. On the other hand, kefir-baked arepas exhibited significant resistance to natural and artificial fungal contamination. Finally, both kefir-baked and kefir-sprayed arepas retained the organoleptic characteristics of the traditional corn product, but with certain tastes imparted by the kefir fermentation. This work constitutes the first study on fungal inhibition by kefir-fermented milk extending to the protection of corn products of mass-consumption and the possible application as a food preservative."

The experiments were conducted in the two growing seasons (2013–2014). Nitrogen rates demonstrated a highly significant (P ≤ 0.01) influence on the number of kernels per ear (NKE), thousand kernel weight (TKW), the incidence of Fusarium spp. (F. proliferatum, F. subglutinans, and F. verticillioides) and level of total fumonisins B₁, B₂, and B₃ (FBs). The ear treatment showed a highly significant (P ≤ 0.01) effect on maize quality parameters (NIK, the incidence of Fusarium spp. and FBs level) and significant (P ≤ 0.05) for TKW. Among identified Fusarium spp. , F. verticillioides was predominant, with the highest presence found at 120 (62.41%) and 180 kg N ha⁻¹ (61.81%). The occurrence of F. proliferatum was not significant at 0, 60, and 120 kg N ha⁻¹, with the highest value recorded at 120 kg N ha⁻¹ (0.69%). The highest incidence of F. subglutinans was at 60 kg N ha⁻¹ (4.94%). The higher presence of F. verticillioides was obtained in the inoculated (84.55%) compared to control ear treatments (36.59%), while it was vice versa for the incidence of F. proliferatum and F. subglutinans. The level of FBs was the highest at 120 kg N ha⁻¹ (21.72 mg kg⁻¹), especially in inoculated ear treatments (32.84 mg kg⁻¹). A positive and significant relationship was found for NIK, with F. verticillioides and FBs level. Investigated years significantly influenced the incidence of Fusarium spp. In addition, there was a significant effect of hybrids on NIK, the incidence of Fusarium spp. , and FBs levels. A higher incidence of F. proliferatum and F. verticillioides and increased FBs level were recorded in NS 6030 hybrid compare to ZP 666. The mean FBs level in all the treatments was above a maximum limit (4 mg kg⁻¹) adopted by EU regulation for unprocessed maize. The N rates did not have a consistent effect on the incidence of Fusarium spp. and FBs level. However, a hybrid effect was more consistent on the maize quality parameters, whereby the hybrid NS 6030 was more sensitive to fungal fumonisin producers and FBs contamination than ZP 666. In addition, the effect of the years significantly influenced the incidence of Fusarium spp. , but did not affect on FBs level. These results indicate the importance of studying relationships between different factors affecting the occurrence of fungal contamination, therefore, improving preventative measures of maize protection would reduce the risks on animal and human health."

In two field trials, we observed a preferred natural infestation of specific maize ( Zea mays L. ) genotypes by corn earworm ( Helicoverpa zea Boddie) and investigated this unexpected interaction. These studies involved four maize lines with contrasting levels of resistance to Aspergillus flavus. The resistant lines had 7 to 14-fold greater infested ears than the susceptible lines. However, seed aflatoxin B 1 levels, in mock- or A. flavus -inoculated ears were consistent with maize genotype resistance to A. flavus. Further, the corn earworm-infested ears had greater levels of fumonisin content in seeds than uninfested ears, indicating that the insect may have vectored native Fusarium verticillioides inoculum. The two maize lines with heavy infestation showed delayed flowering. The availability of young silk for egg-laying could have been a factor in the pervasive corn earworm damage of these lines. At the same time, H. zea larvae reared on AF-infused diet showed decreasing mass with increasing AF and >30% lethality at 250 ppb. In contrast, corn earworm was tolerant to fumonisin with no significant loss in mass even at 100 ppm, implicating the low seed aflatoxin content as a predominant factor for the prevalence of corn earworm infestation and the associated fumonisin contamination in A. flavus resistant lines. These results highlight the need for integrated strategies targeting mycotoxigenic fungi and their insect vectors to enhance the safety of crop commodities. Aspergillus and Fusarium spp. not only cause ear rots in maize leading to crop loss, they can also contaminate the grain with carcinogenic mycotoxins. Incorporation of genetic resistance into breeding lines is an ideal solution for mycotoxin mitigation. However, the goal is fraught by a major problem. Resistance for AF or FUM accumulation is quantitative and contributed by several loci with small effects. Our work reveals that host phenology (flowering time) and insect vector-mycotoxin interactions can further confound breeding efforts. A host genotype even with demonstrable resistance can become vulnerable due to seasonal variation in flowering time or an outbreak of chewing insects. Incorporation of resistance to a single mycotoxin accumulation and not pairing it with insect resistance may not adequately ensure food safety. Diverse strategies including host-induced silencing of genes essential for fungal and insect pest colonization and broad-spectrum biocontrol systems need to be considered for robust mycotoxin mitigation."

Bt-protected corn, cotton, and potato were introduced into the United States in 1995/1996 and grown on a total of approximately 10 million acres in 1997, 20 million acres in 1998, and 29 million acres globally in 1999. The extremely rapid adoption of these Bt-protected crops demonstrates the outstanding grower satisfaction of the performance and value of these products. These crops provide highly effective control of major insect pests such as the European corn borer, southwestern corn borer, tobacco budworm, cotton bollworm, pink bollworm, and Colorado potato beetle and reduce reliance on conventional chemical pesticides. They have provided notably higher yields in cotton and corn. The estimated total net savings to the grower using Bt-protected cotton in the United States was approximately $92 million in 1998. Other benefits of these crops include reduced levels of the fungal toxin fumonisin in corn and the opportunity for supplemental pest control by beneficial insects due to the reduced use of broad-spectrum insecticides. Insect resistance management plans are being implemented to ensure the prolonged effectiveness of these products. Extensive testing of Bt-protected crops has been conducted which establishes the safety of these products to humans, animals, and the environment. Acute, subchronic, and chronic toxicology studies conducted over the past 40 years establish the safety of the microbial Bt products, including their expressed insecticidal (Cry) proteins, which are fully approved for marketing. Mammalian toxicology and digestive fate studies, which have been conducted with the proteins produced in the currently approved Bt-protected plant products, have confirmed that these Cry proteins are nontoxic to humans and pose no significant concern for allergenicity. Food and feed derived from Bt-protected crops which have been fully approved by regulatory agencies have been shown to be substantially equivalent to the food and feed derived from conventional crops. Nontarget organisms exposed to high levels of Cry protein are virtually unaffected, except for certain insects that are closely related to the target pests. Because the Cry protein is contained within the plant (in microgram quantities), the potential for exposure to farm workers and nontarget organisms is extremely low. The Cry proteins produced in Bt-protected crops have been shown to rapidly degrade when crop residue is incorporated into the soil. Thus the environmental impact of these crops is negligible. The human and environmental safety of Bt-protected crops is further supported by the long history of safe use for Bt microbial pesticides around the world."

The sources and distribution of heavy metals in farmland soils were analyzed using Kriging spatial interpolation and principal component analysis, and the ecological risk was evaluated using the single factor index, comprehensive pollution index, and potential ecological risk index. The results showed that the surrounding farmland soils in the closed Manganese mining area presented serious pollution of Cd, Zn, As, and Mn, in which the average contents of the above heavy metals in the dry land soil in the polluted area were 6.22, 612.28, 37.72, and 1506.2 mg·kg-1, respectively. Compared with the soil risk screening value of agricultural land, the over-standard rates of Cd, Zn, and As were 88.41%, 94.20%, and 84.06%, respectively, and the average content of Mn in the farmland soil was three times that of the background value in the Hunan soil; however, the heavy metal pollution in the paddy field was relatively light. The principal component analysis showed that the sources of Cd, Mn, and Zn in the farmland soil were related to the manganese ore mining, whereas the source of As in the farmland soil might originate from agricultural activities. The pollution area was at a heavy pollution level, and the main pollution factors were Cd, Mn, and Zn. The Cd in the farmland soil could pose a strong potential ecological risk, but the rest of the heavy metals presented only a slight potential ecological risk. The content of Cr, Pb, and Cd in the crops in the study area exceeded the standard, and the exceeding standard rate was between 1.1% and 37.3%, where the average content of over-standard heavy metals in corn was higher than that in rice, and the average content of heavy metals in leafy vegetables was higher than that in root vegetables. The soil pollution degree of heavy metals could affect the accumulation ability of crops, and different crops had different accumulation abilities. For instance, leafy vegetables and root vegetables easily accumulated Cd and Zn; however, rice and corn separately enriched Cd and Cr, as well as Zn and Cu. The contents of heavy metals in dryland soils had a positive correlation with the content of heavy metals in corresponding crops. The contents of Cd and As in the paddy field and rice presented a positive correlation, but the remaining six heavy metal contents in rice (i. e. , Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pb) did not correlate with the content of the paddy fields."

More than 300 mycotoxins are known today, but only five of them (aflatoxin B1, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisins and ochratoxin A) are regulated by EU legislation for animal feed. The current study reflects the requirements of the European Food Safety Authority for gathering the data allowing reliable quantitative exposure assessments. This is the first report combining the data for the occurrence of 56 mycotoxins produced by Fusarium, Alternaria, Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Claviceps fungi species in 18 classes of non-fermented or fermented feedingstuffs, feedingstuff supplements, and complex compound feeds (altogether 343 samples collected between 2008 and 2012). Samples were extracted by the QuEChERS (Quick Easy Cheap Rugged and Safe) procedure. For separation and target mycotoxins detection, ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was employed. In most of the investigated feedingstuff commodities, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisins, ochratoxin A, enniatins, beauvericin, Alternaria toxins, ergot alkaloids, roquefortine C and mycophenolic acid were quantified, in some cases at concentrations up to thousands of μg/kg, depending on the composition of the particular sample. The broadest spectrum of detected mycotoxins, as well as the highest concentrations, was quantified in dried distillers’ grains with solubles (DDGS). Based on the performed analyses, the dietary intake of particular mycotoxins was estimated considering the feedingstuffs consumption by the respective farm animal. It was found that the most significant exposure of animals occurred after the consumption of ‘basic’ feedings, i. e. maize silage and complex compound feeds for dairy cattle (average dietary intake for the most important mycotoxins were 2.3–5.4μg/kg of BW for nivalenol, 9.2–10.8μg/kg of BW for deoxynivalenol, 1–1.4μg/kg of BW for FUS-X, 0.2–0.4μg/kg of BW for zearalenone, 0.03–1.8 for enniatins, and 0.5–5.4μg/kg of BW for mycophenolic acid), complex compound feeds for pigs (in average 12μg/kg of BW for deoxynivalenol, 0.8μg/kg of BW for zearalenone, 0.3μg/kg of BW for fumonisin B1, and 1.8–9.2μg/kg of BW for enniatins), and complex compound feeds for chickens and laying hens (18.2μg/kg of BW for deoxynivalenol, 1.1μg/kg of BW for HT-2 toxin, 0.1μg/kg of BW for zearalenone, and 0.4–3.9μg/kg of BW for enniatins). Nevertheless, quite high animal exposure to mycotoxins was calculated also for maize-based DDGS usually used as a supplementary feed. In spite of a lower dosage of these feedingstuff supplements, relatively high mycotoxins concentrations determined here caused the increased dietary intake."

Predicting the aflatoxin risk is challenging due to complex interactions of biotic and abiotic stress factors that govern and exacerbate the phenomenon. The goal of this study was to determine whether a drought index could be used to predict the risk for pre-harvest aflatoxin contamination in corn. Risk assessment was approached at: 1) field (plot) level with data obtained from an in-field controlled experiment (Mississippi study), and 2) state level, where corn fields were sampled at a county level (Georgia study). The data used for this study consisted of historical records on aflatoxin contamination collected over thirteen growing seasons from 2000 to 2011, 2013, and 2014 at Mississippi State, Mississippi (1), and from random corn fields in 53 counties across Georgia between 1977 and 2004 (2). A controlled experiment was conducted at Mississippi with two soil types (a Leeper silty clay loam and a Myatt loam), and three commercial hybrids characterized by different susceptibility levels to aflatoxin contamination. The Agricultural Reference Index for Drought (ARID), a generic drought index for calculating drought on daily basis was evaluated as an aflatoxin risk prediction tool. Mid-silk day was selected to split each growing season into two time periods, which were further divided into positive and negative weeks representing weeks after and before mid-silk, respectively. Weekly ARID factors were calculated for all periods to evaluate the in-season alterations in aflatoxin risk. In both studies, multiple logistic regression models were used to predict aflatoxin risk as a function of the weekly ARID values. In Mississippi, risk level changes were additionally tested according to soil type and corn hybrid aflatoxin susceptibility. The United States Food and Drug Administration restricts corn grain consumption by humans and young animals if the contamination level is above 20 μg/kg; thus, this threshold (20 μg/kg) was selected to develop a binary dependent variable for the logistic model from the raw aflatoxin data. The results revealed that ARID might be used as a predictive tool to assess aflatoxin risk, soil type and hybrid susceptibility to aflatoxin contamination were statistically significant independent factors, and there are critical week windows during the growing season when changes in drought conditions affect the likelihood for aflatoxin contamination. These findings can be used to minimize risk by adapting site-specific management strategies such as triggering irrigation during critical risk weeks, selecting the most appropriate hybrid for a given site/location based on soil type, and determining optimum harvest date."

It is evident that plants are capable of tolerating, transporting, and assimilating iron cyanides. The objectives of this study were to investigate the influence of temperatures on the removal and bioaccumulation of two chemical forms of iron cyanides by maize seedlings. Maize (Zea mays L. var. ZN 304) seedlings were grown hydroponically and treated with ferro- or ferri-cyanide in solution for 5 days. Six different temperatures were tested ranging from 12 to 27 degrees C. Total cyanide in solution phase and plant tissues was analyzed spectrophotometrically. The temperature coefficient (Q (10)) was also determined for maize exposed to both iron cyanides. The dissociation of both iron cyanides to free cyanide in solution was below the detection limit. Maize seedlings showed a significantly higher removal potential for ferro-cyanide than ferri-cyanide at all treatment temperatures. Analysis of mass balance revealed that the majority of these iron cyanides taken up from the hydroponic solutions was assimilated by maize, and roots were the major sink for cyanide accumulation. The Q (10) values were determined for ferro- and ferri-cyanide to be 2.31 and 2.75, respectively. Due to the significant difference in the removal rate between the two species of iron cyanides by plant, the conversion of ferri- to ferro-cyanide in aqueous solution prior to uptake is unlikely. Compared to the treatments amended with ferro-cyanide, more cyanide was recovered in plant materials of maize when exposed to ferri-cyanide, implying that ferri-cyanide is less sensitive to degradation than ferro-cyanide. Although the velocity of botanical assimilation of ferro-cyanide was faster than that of ferri-cyanide at any of the treatment temperatures, the removal of ferri-cyanide by maize was more sensitive to changes in temperature than that of ferro-cyanide. Removal of both iron cyanides by maize seedlings was observed to be positive in response to temperatures. Changes in temperatures have a substantial influence on not only the uptake and assimilation of ferro- and ferri-cyanide by maize but also cyanide accumulation in plant tissues. As one of the crucial abiotic factors involved in phytoremediation, temperature shows a positive influence on the removal of iron cyanides by plants. Further investigation on the fate of ferro- and ferri-cyanide in plant tissues would have helped distinguish the differences in the botanical assimilation pathways between the two iron cyanides. The ability of maize to remove iron cyanides has important implications on the vegetation management of environmental contamination."

Technogenic dispersion of heavy metals (HMs) causes adverse effects on living organisms and creates unfavorable conditions for the existence of humans, animals, and plants. The purpose of this study was to analyze the content of several HMs in samples of soil, horse feed (hay, mixed feed, and bran), mare's milk, and manure to assess bioaccumulation and possible adverse effects on the bodies of horses. An additional purpose was to identify areas with acceptable conditions for obtaining environmentally safe horse breeding products in the agricultural zones of the Almaty region, Kazakhstan. Samples were obtained from two farms in the Almaty region in 2020 (spring, summer, and autumn). In total, 72 soil samples were analyzed, which were taken from the upper humus horizon to the depth of the arable layer. Eighty-six samples were taken from the feed of horses. Green feed was represented by perennial and annual grasses (alsike clover, Medicago sativa, sweet yellow clover, as well as pea and oat mix). Barley and wheat bran stored in the warehouses of the farm were sampled for the research as feed supplements. The mixed feed comprised components such as maize and sunflower. In addition, 46 samples of mare's milk and 28 samples of horse manure were collected. The HM analysis was performed in the laboratory of the Kazakh-Japanese Innovation Center. The residual amounts of HMs were determined using an absorption spectrometer with a voltammetric analyzer. The content of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and arsenic (As) in all the studied samples of soil, feed, mare's milk, and manure did not exceed the threshold limit values (TLVs), suggesting that the intake of these toxic elements into the human body with food was low. The average Cd concentration was in the range of 0.29-0.31 mg/kg in soil samples and in the range of 0.20-0.27 mg/kg in feed samples. In milk, the Cd concentration varied from 0.01 to 0.02 mg/L and was lower in summer and higher in fall. The total average Cd content in horse manure was 0.1844 mg/kg. The concentration of Pb in soil samples ranged from 1.09 to 1.30 mg/kg with the lowest value in spring and the highest in fall.

In a thorough and up-to-date evaluation of all the fossil energy costs of ethanol production from corn, every step in the production and conversion process must be included. In this study, 14 energy inputs in average U. S. corn production are included. Then, in the fermentation/distillation operation, 9 more identified fossil fuel inputs are included. Some energy and economic credits are given for the by-products, including dried distillers grains (DDG). Based on all the fossil energy inputs, a total of 1.43 kcal fossil energy is expended to produced 1 kcal ethanol. When the energy value of the DDG, based on the feed value of the DDG as compared to that of soybean meal, is considered, the energy cost of ethanol production is reduced slightly, to 1.28 kcal fossil energy input per 1 kcal ethanol produced. Several proethanol investigators have overlooked various energy inputs in U. S. corn production, including farm machinery, processing machinery, and the use of hybrid corn. In other studies, unrealistic, low energy costs were attributed to such inputs as nitrogen fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides. Controversy continues concerning the energy and economic credits that should be assigned to the by-products. The U. S. Department of Energy reports that 17.0 billion L ethanol was produced in 2005. This represents only less than 1% of total oil use in the U. S. These yields are based on using about 18% of total U. S. corn production and 18% of cornland. Because the production of ethanol requires large inputs of both oil and natural gas in production, the U. S. is importing both oil and natural gas to produce ethanol. Furthermore, the U. S. Government is spending about dollar 3 billion annually to subsidize ethanol production, a subsidy of dollar 0.79/L ethanol produced. With the subsidy, plus the cost of production, the cost of ethanol is calculated to be dollar 1.21/L. The subsidy for a liter of ethanol is 45-times greater than the subsidy per liter of gasoline. The environmental costs associated with producing ethanol are significant but have been ignored by most investigators in terms of energy and economics. The negative environmental impacts on cropland, and freshwater, as well as air pollution and public health, have yet to be carefully assessed. These environmental costs in terms of energy and economics should be calculated and included in future ethanol analyses. General concern has been expressed about taking 18% of U. S. corn, and more in the future, to produce ethanol for burning in automobiles instead of using the corn as food for the many malnourished people in the world. The World Health Organization reports that more than 3.7 billion humans are currently malnourished in the world--the largest number ever in history."

This study aimed to estimate the impact of climate change effects on mycotoxin contamination of cereal grains cultivated in the terrestrial area of north west Europe, and on the frequency of harmful algal blooms and contamination of shellfish with marine biotoxins in the North Sea coastal zone. The study focused on contamination of wheat with deoxynivalenol, and on abundance of Dinophysis spp. and the possible relationship with diarrhetic shellfish toxins. The study used currently available data and models. Global and regional climate models were combined with models of crop phenology, mycotoxin prediction models, hydrodynamic models and ecological models, with the output of one model being used as input for the other. In addition, statistical data analyses using existing national datasets from the study area were performed to obtain information on the relationships between Dinophysis spp. cell counts and contamination of shellfish with diarrhetic shellfish toxins as well as on frequency of cereal cropping. In this paper, a summary of the study is presented, and overall conclusions and recommendations are given. Climate change projections for the years 2031-2050 were used as the starting point of the analyses relative to a preceding 20-year baseline period from which the climate change signal was calculated. Results showed that, in general, climate change effects lead to advanced flowering and harvest of wheat, and increased risk of contamination of wheat with deoxynivalenol. Blooms of dinoflagellates were estimated to occur more often. If the group of Dinophysis spp. behaves similarly to other flagellates in the future then frequency of harmful algal blooms of Dinophysis spp. may also increase, but consequences for contamination of shellfish with diarrhetic shellfish toxins are uncertain. Climate change will also have indirect effects on toxin contamination, which may be equally important. For example, the frequency of cropping of wheat and maize in north Europe was projected to increase under climate change, which will also increase the risk of contamination of the grains with deoxynivalenol. Risk managers are encouraged to consider the entire range of the predictions of climate change effects on food safety hazards, rather than median or average values only. Furthermore, it is recommended to closely monitor levels of mycotoxins and marine biotoxins in the future, in particular related to risky situations associated with favourable climatic conditions for toxin producing organisms. In particular, it is important to pay attention to the continuity of collecting the right data, and the availability and accessibility of databases. On a European level, it is important to stress the need for harmonisation of terminology and data collection."

N is a key element for plant growth and is often one of the most important yield-limiting nutrients in paddy soil. Urea-N immobilization is an important process for restoring the levels of soil nutrient depleted by rice production and sustaining productivity. The benefits of biochar application include improved soil fertility, altered N dynamics, and reduced nutrient leaching. However, due to high variability in the quality of biochar, the responses of N loss and rice productivity to biochar amendments, especially those prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures, are still unclear. The main objectives of the present study were to examine the effects of biochar prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures on fertilizer N immobilization in paddy soil and explore the underlying mechanisms. Two biochar samples were prepared by pyrolysis of maize straw at 400 °C (B400) and 700 °C (B700), respectively. The biochar was applied to paddy soil at three rates (0, 0.7, and 2.1%, w/w), with or without N fertilization (0, 168, and 210 kg N ha-1). Pot experiments were performed to determine nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and 15N recovery from paddy soil using a 15N tracer across the rice growing season. Compared with the non-biochar control, biochar significantly decreased soil bulk density while increasing soil porosity, irrespective of pyrolysis temperature and N fertilizer level. Under B400 and B700, a high biochar rate decreased N loss rate to 66.42 and 68.90%, whereas a high N level increased it to 77.21 and 76.99%, respectively. Biochar also markedly decreased N2O emissions to 1.06 (B400) and 0.75 kg ha-1 (B700); low-N treatment caused a decrease in N2O emissions under B400, but this decrease was not observed under B700. An application rate of biochar of 2.1% plus 210 kg ha-1 N fertilizer substantially decreased the N fertilizer-induced N2O emission factor under B400, whereas under B700 no significant difference was observed. Biochar combined with N fertilizer treatment decreased rice biomass and grain yield by an average of 51.55 and 23.90 g pot-1, respectively, but the yield reduction under B700 was lower than under B400. Irrespective of pyrolysis temperature, biochar had a positive effect on residual soil 15N content, while it negatively affected the 15N recovery of rice, N2O emissions from soil, rice biomass, and grain yield in the first year. Generally, a high application rate of biochar prepared at high or low pyrolysis temperature reduced the N fertilizer-induced N2O emission factor considerably. These biochar effects were dependent on N fertilizer level, biochar application rate, and their interactions."

After the accident, an urgent soil cleaning up was carried out in some places. Seventeen years later, cereal (rice, maize, and sorghum), pulses (soybean, Adzuki bean, mung bean and peanut), vegetables (ipomoea, capsicum, taro and string bean) and the rooted soils were sampled at four sites: (1) the mining area (SZY), (2) the area still covered with the mining tailing spills (GYB), (3) the cleaned area from mining tailing spills (JTC), and (4) a background site (REF). Metal concentrations in the crops and soils were analyzed to evaluate the long-term effects of the spilled waste on the soil and the potential human exposure through food chains. The results showed that the physical-chemical properties of the soils obviously changed due to the different farming styles used by each individual farmer. Leaching effects and plant extraction of metals from some soils were quite weak. Certain soils were still heavily polluted with As, Cd, Zn, Pb and Cu. The contamination levels were in the order of GYB>SZY>JTC showing that the clean-up treatment was effective. The maximum allowable concentration (MAC) levels for Chinese agricultural soils were still highly exceeded, particularly for As and Cd (followed by Zn, Pb and Cu), with mean concentrations of 709 and 7.6 mg kg(-1), respectively. These concentrations exceed the MAC levels by 24 times for As and 13 times for Cd at GYB. Generally, the edible leaves or stems of crops were more heavily contaminated than seeds or fruits. Ipomoea was the most severely contaminated crop. The concentrations of Cd and Pb were 3.30 and 76.9 mg kg(-1) in ipomoea leaves at GYB, which exceeded the maximum permit levels (0.5 mg kg(-1) for Cd and 9 mg kg(-1) for Pb) by 6.6 and 8.5 times, respectively. Taro (+skin) could accumulate high concentrations of Zn and Cd in the edible stem, and rice and capsicum had high Cd concentration in the edible parts. However, the toxic element concentrations in maize, sorghum, Adzuki bean, soybean and mung bean remained lower than the threshold levels. The bio-accumulation factors (BAFs) of crops were in the order: Cd>Zn>Cu>Pb>As. BAF was typically lower in the edible seeds or fruits than in stems and leaves. The accumulation effect strongly depends on the crop's physiological properties, the mobility, of the metals, and the availability of metals in soils but not entirely on the total element concentrations in the soils. Even so, the estimated daily intake amount of Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb from the crops grown in the affected three sites and arsenic at SZY and GYB exceeded the RDA (Recommended dietary allowance) levels. Subsequently, the crops grown in Chenzhou Pb/Zn mine waste affected area might have a hazardous effect on the consumer's health. This area still needs effective measures to cure the As, Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu contamination."

A current example is the use of the insecticidal Cry proteins from the bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), to improve crops, known as Bt crops, by reducing injury from various crop pests. The adoption of genetically modified (GM) crops has increased dramatically in the last 11 years. However, the introduction of GM plants into agricultural ecosystems has raised a number of questions, including the ecological impact of these plants on soil ecosystems. Crop residues are the primary source of carbon in soil, and root exudates govern which organisms reside in the rhizosphere. Therefore, any change to the quality of crop residues and rhizosphere inputs could modify the dynamics of the composition and activity of organisms in soil. Insect-resistant Bt crops have the potential to change the microbial dynamics, biodiversity, and essential ecosystem functions in soil, because they usually produce insecticidal Cry proteins through all parts of the plant. It is crucial that risk assessment studies on the commercial use of Bt crops consider the impacts on organisms in soil. In general, few or no toxic effects of Cry proteins on woodlice, collembolans, mites, earthworms, nematodes, protozoa, and the activity of various enzymes in soil have been reported. Although some effects, ranging from no effect to minor and significant effects, of Bt plants on microbial communities in soil have been reported, using both culturing and molecular techniques, they were mostly the result of differences in geography, temperature, plant variety, and soil type and, in general, were transient and not related to the presence of the Cry proteins. The respiration (i. e. , CO2 evolution) of soils cultivated with Bt maize or amended with biomass of Bt maize and other Bt crops was generally lower than from soils cultivated with or amended with biomass of the respective non-Bt isolines, which may have been a result of differences in chemical composition (e. g. , the content of starch, soluble N, proteins, carbohydrates, lignin) between Bt plants and their near-isogenic counterparts. Laboratory and field studies have shown differences in the persistence of the Cry proteins in soil, which appear to be the result primarily of differences in microbial activity, which, in turn, is dependent on soil type (e. g. , pH, clay mineral composition, other physicochemical characteristics), season (e. g. , temperature, water tension), crop species (e. g. , chemical composition, C:N ratio, plant part), crop management practices (e. g. , till vs. no-till), and other environmental factors that vary with location and climate zones. This review discusses the available data on the effects of Cry proteins on below-ground organisms, the fate of these proteins in soil, the techniques and indicators that are available to study these aspects, and future directions."

Since the late 1970s, the volume of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) applied has increased approximately 100-fold. Further increases in the volume applied are likely due to more and higher rates of application in response to the widespread emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds and new, pre-harvest, dessicant use patterns. GBHs were developed to replace or reduce reliance on herbicides causing well-documented problems associated with drift and crop damage, slipping efficacy, and human health risks. Initial industry toxicity testing suggested that GBHs posed relatively low risks to non-target species, including mammals, leading regulatory authorities worldwide to set high acceptable exposure limits. To accommodate changes in GBH use patterns associated with genetically engineered, herbicide-tolerant crops, regulators have dramatically increased tolerance levels in maize, oilseed (soybeans and canola), and alfalfa crops and related livestock feeds. Animal and epidemiology studies published in the last decade, however, point to the need for a fresh look at glyphosate toxicity. Furthermore, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer recently concluded that glyphosate is ""probably carcinogenic to humans. "" In response to changing GBH use patterns and advances in scientific understanding of their potential hazards, we have produced a Statement of Concern drawing on emerging science relevant to the safety of GBHs. Our Statement of Concern considers current published literature describing GBH uses, mechanisms of action, toxicity in laboratory animals, and epidemiological studies. It also examines the derivation of current human safety standards. We conclude that: (1) GBHs are the most heavily applied herbicide in the world and usage continues to rise; (2) Worldwide, GBHs often contaminate drinking water sources, precipitation, and air, especially in agricultural regions; (3) The half-life of glyphosate in water and soil is longer than previously recognized; (4) Glyphosate and its metabolites are widely present in the global soybean supply; (5) Human exposures to GBHs are rising; (6) Glyphosate is now authoritatively classified as a probable human carcinogen; (7) Regulatory estimates of tolerable daily intakes for glyphosate in the United States and European Union are based on outdated science. We offer a series of recommendations related to the need for new investments in epidemiological studies, biomonitoring, and toxicology studies that draw on the principles of endocrinology to determine whether the effects of GBHs are due to endocrine disrupting activities. We suggest that common commercial formulations of GBHs should be prioritized for inclusion in government-led toxicology testing programs such as the U. S. National Toxicology Program, as well as for biomonitoring as conducted by the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

Presently, oat represents only ~1.3% of the total world grain production, and its production system is fragmented. Nonetheless, current interest is growing because of recent knowledge on its potential benefits in food, feed and agriculture. This perspective will serve as a further impetus, with special focus on the recently valued advantages of oats in human food and health. Five approved European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) health claims apply to oats. Four relate to the oat-specific soluble fibres, the beta-glucans, and concern the maintenance and reduction of blood cholesterol, better blood glucose balance and increased faecal bulk. The fifth claim concerns the high content of unsaturated fatty acids, especially present in the endosperm, which reduces the risks of heart and vascular diseases. Furthermore, oat starch has a low glycemic index, which is favourable for weight control. Oat-specific polyphenols and avenanthramides have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, oats can contribute significantly to the presently recommended whole-grain diet. Next to globulins, oats contain a small fraction of prolamin storage proteins, called 'avenins', but at a much lower quantity than gluten proteins in wheat, barley and rye. Oat avenins do not contain any of the known coeliac disease epitopes from gluten of wheat, barley and rye. Long-term food studies confirm the safety of oats for coeliac disease patients and the positive health effects of oat products in a gluten-free diet. These effects are general and independent of oat varieties. In the EU (since 2009), the USA (since 2013) and Canada (since 2015) oat products may be sold as gluten-free provided that any gluten contamination level is below 20ppm. Oats are, however, generally not gluten-free when produced in a conventional production chain, because of regular contamination with wheat, barley or rye. Therefore, establishing a separate gluten-free oat production chain requires controlling all steps in the chain; the strict conditions will be discussed. Genomic tools, including a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker array and a dense genetic map, have recently been developed and will support marker-assisted breeding. In 2015, the Oat Global initiative emerged enabling a world-wide cooperation starting with a data sharing facility on genotypic, metabolic and phenotypic characteristics. Further, the EU project TRAFOON (Traditional Food Networks) facilitated the transfer of knowledge to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to stimulate innovations in oat production, processing, products and marketing, among others with regard to gluten-free. Finally, with focus on counteracting market fragmentation of the global oat market and production chains, interactive innovation strategies between customers (consumers) and companies through co-creation are discussed."

On the other hand, these pesticides are a double-edged sword because they have both acute effects and chronic adverse effects on human health. The widespread use of pesticides has led to their persistence in soil, water, and agricultural products, thus posing a serious threat to public health. Therefore, the removal and analysis of pesticides are critical to protecting human safety and health. When removing pesticides from the environment, it is imperative to ensure high removal efficiency while preventing secondary pollution to the environment. Because of the low concentrations of pesticide residue in the environment, complex matrix, and large throughput of pesticide residue analysis, a low-cost fast pre-treatment technique that has strong selectivity and an enrichment effect on the target pesticide residue, with little environmental impact, is required. Plant biomass-derived biochar is obtained from wheat straw, corn cob, rice husk, etc. This material has a large specific surface area, high pore capacity, tunable surface functional groups, and good environmental compatibility, which make it an inexpensive and efficient adsorbent. Hence, there is a need to systematically review the knowledge regarding the application of plant-based biochar on pesticide removal and pesticide residue analysis. This paper reviews the application progress of plant biomass-derived biochar in the above mentioned two areas over the last decade. The pesticide removal applications include reducing the mobility of pesticides in soil, eliminating the pollution caused by chiral pesticides, loading pesticide-degrading bacteria, and releasing fertilizers sustainably when removing pesticide. As mentioned above, plant biomass-derived biochar has a large specific surface area, a high number of functional groups on the surface, and good environmental compatibility. Therefore, it can effectively remove pesticides or their metabolites from the environment without causing any secondary pollution. During pre-treatment, plan biomass-derived biochar is used as an adsorbent for dispersive solid-phase extraction, solid-phase microextraction, and magnetic solid-phase extraction to selectively adsorb organophosphorus and triazole pesticides in fruits and vegetables, as well as organochlorine pesticides in the aquatic environment. This paper also introduces the adsorption mechanism of plant biomass-derived biochar, where studies based on computational simulations such as the density functional theory, molecular dynamics simulation, and giant canonical Monte Carlo simulation are carefully discussed. The benefits of adopting computational simulations are also mentioned. Finally, this paper summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of using plant biomass-derived biochar in pesticide removal and pre-treatment, as well as the future research trends in this area."

            Dictionary: None</s>",{'food': ['chemical']}</s>,"The burden of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been increasing in Egypt with a doubling in the incidence rate in the past 10 years. This has been attributed to several biological (e. g. hepatitis B and C virus infection) and environmental factors (e. g. aflatoxin, AF). Other factors such as cigarette smoking, occupational exposure to chemicals such as pesticides, and endemic infections in the community, such as schistosomiasis, may have additional roles in the etiology or progression of the disease. Estimates of the burden of cancer caused by these factors provide an opportunity for prevention. Previously, there was strong evidence that hepatitis B virus (HBV) was the major cause of HCC in Egypt, but more recently HCV has become the predominant factor associated with the more recent epidemic of HCC. It has been well documented that Egypt has one of the highest prevalence rates of HCV infection in the world. The natural history of HCV infection and disease progression, however, are influenced by additional factors such as duration of infection, age at infection, sex, co-infection with HBV, the level of HCV viraemia and its genotype. The role of exposure to aflatoxins and development of HCC in Egypt was historically less clear. Nevertheless, recent food sampling surveys and population-based studies indicated that exposure to aflatoxins in Egypt may have been underestimated in the past. Recent results indicated that both local and imported samples were positive for aflatoxin B1 (AFB1, 17.5% and 20%, respectively), with concentrations ranging from 3 to 25 microg/kg. The level of AFB1 was dependent on the area of collection as well as the season of the year. In a population-based study, the level and frequency of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1, a major metabolite of aflatoxin B1 excreted in breast milk) was assessed as a biomarker of maternal exposure. The samples were collected from a selected group of 388 Egyptian lactating mothers during May-September 2003. Non-working status, obesity, high corn oil consumption, and the number of offspring contributed to the variability in occurrence of AFM1 in breast milk. Prevention and intervention approaches directed to risk factors of HCC can play a critical role in its prevention. In the case of HCV infection a prevention programme can be achieved by changing personal behaviors and/or cultural habits which are risk factors for HCV transmission, such as injection with contaminated syringes, blood transfusion, surgical operations, venous catheterization, use of common syringes, dental treatment and circumcision at home. Prevention of exposure to aflatoxins can be achieved either at community (via good agriculture practices) or individual levels (treatment or dietary interventions). In conclusion, due to the alarming increase in the incidence of HCC in Egypt, there is a need to further investigate the contribution of these emerging risk factors to the development of HCC in Egypt. This may enable us to determine the susceptibility to HCC among high-risk groups and to provide these individuals with effective measures for early prevention or intervention."

Aflatoxicosis is a serious problem in developing countries with environmental conditions appropriate for the biosynthesis of AFB1 byAspergillus flavus andAspergillus parasiticus. In Africa, especially in Ghana and Nigeria, there is a very high risk of liver cancer which is caused by the consumption of AFB1-intoxicated, traditionally fermented maize and sorghum products. It is suggested that one way to diminish this health risk might be the reduction of the AFB1 concentration in foods by bacteria. Especially bacteria used for food fermentation processes are of great importance, with a special emphasis on lactic acid bacteria which are involved in traditionally fermented African foods based on maize and sorghum. Most publications dealing with aflatoxin degradation by microorganisms describe a phosphate buffer test system for the performance of degradation experiments. In contrast to that, a test system based on physiological active bacterial and yeast cells has been developed, to assess food fermentation organisms for their ability to reduce the AFB1 concentration in vitro. The aflatoxin B1 concentration in test samples was quatitatively determined by HPLC. The assessment of lactic acid bacteria originating from different German and other European culture collections only showed a very slight reduction of the AFB1 concentration from 3% to 12%. Screening experiments in which other bacterial genera and lactic acid bacteria, isolated from different African foods have been assessed, in most cases showed the same results. However, some bacterial strains, e. g. strains of the genusBacillus derived from European culture collections and strains of the genusLactobacillus isolated from African foods, caused a release of AFB1 which was chemically bound before to components of the test medium and which therefore could not be extracted with chloroform. A process quite similar to that may happen during food fermentations. Different experiments showed that e. g. cellulose can bind AFB1 very effectively. Cellulose and different other food components are well known to absorb AFB1. During fermentation the cellulose and other AFB1-absorbing components may be degraded and the AFB1 will be released again. The only bacterial strain known as yet which is able to reduce the AFB1 concentration in vitro and in different food comodities isNocardia corynebacteroides (formerFlavobacterium aurantiacum). Nevertheless the mechanism of this AFB1 reduction is actually not well understood, it still has to be investigated. In the meantime several other bacterial strains, presumably from the taxonomic group of theActinomycetes could be proved to be effective reducers of the AFB1 concentration in our in vitro test system. Because as yet no food relevant microorganism could be found, which is able to degrade AFB1, these new strains in general offer the possibility for a genetic modification of food relevant microorganisms. This seems to be the way to come to starter cultures which are able to degrade AFB1 during food fermentations."

{'Maize': ['Aflatoxin']}</s>","Aflatoxicosis associated with the consumption of aflatoxin contaminated maize and maize products has been reported in the central part of Tanzania (Chemba, Kondoa, and Kiteto), however little is known about the prevalence of aflatoxin contamination in cattle’s concentrate feed, yet maize constitutes a major component in the feed. The presence of aflatoxin in cattle’s concentrate feed lead to reduced growth rate, and milk production and results ina carryover effect on human being resulting in human health effect. This study aimed at determining the prevalence of aflatoxins contamination, the level of awareness, knowledge, and practices associated with aflatoxin contamination, and control in cattle concentrate feeds produced and sold in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Method Eighty one samples of concentrate feed were collected from concentrate feed processors and sellers in four clusters Ilala, Kinondoni, Temeke, and Ubungo. The samples were nalyzed by Enzyme linked Immuno-sorbent Assay and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Fluorescent Detector. The level of contamination was compared to the WHO/EAC/TBS recommended limit. Also eighty one concentrate processors and sellers were interviewed to assess the level of awareness, knowledge, and human practices associated with aflatoxin contamination and control. Results Sixty three 63/81 (78%) samples were contaminated with total aflatoxin (TAFs) ranging from LOD to 161.32 ppb, mean of 25.89 ± 3.3 ppb which was significantly higher than the tolerable WHO/TBS limit of 15ppb total aflatoxins (P = 0.002), Level of AFB1 in concentrate feed was ranged from LOD to 133.17 ppb, mean 18.87 ± 2.45 ppb and was significantly higher than the tolerable WHO/TBS limit 10 ppb for AFB1 (P = 0.001). The level of AFB2 was ranged from LOD to 8.21 ppb, mean 1.82 ± 0.27 ppb, AFG1 (LOD to 75.06 ppb, mean 7.75 ± 2.32 ppb) and AFG2 (LOD to 7.87 ppb, mean, 1.30 ± 0.350 ppb), among aflatoxin the level of contamination was AFB1 > AFG1 > AFB2 > AFG2, however, AFB2 and AFG2 had significant same level of contamination (p = 0.518). The samples collected from Temeke and Ilala were significant highly contaminated with aflatoxin than the WHO/TBS recommended limit (15 ppb), with TAFs of 33.63 ± 3.96 ppb, p-value = 0.00015, 30.78 ±, 7.05 ppb, p-value = 0.034 respectively, while those from Kinondoni and Ubungo were not significantly higher than the recommended standard 15ppb (p-value, 0.71,0.742) respectively. The level of awareness was 38% and not significant (p = 0.353) and 58/81 (72%) of respondents were not aware of the negative health effect of aflatoxins. The poor storage facility, poor handling practices, temperature, humidity and lack of awareness were the predominant factors identified to contribute a high level of aflatoxin contamination. Conclusions The results indicated that the concentrate feeds had aflatoxin concentrations which may pose risk to animals and/or human beings, economic losses due to increased cost of treatment and reduced cattle production. The use of improved pre and post-harvest management technologies, and awareness creation to animal feed value chain actors are important steps in the reduction of this problem."

In China, the BB emission has changed substantially over the past decades while the multi-year variation held high uncertainty and the driving forces have addressed little attention. Here, this research aimed to conduct a comprehensive and systematic analysis of BB variation in China and provided precise and targeted BB emission reduction suggestions. The moving of high emission for BB from 2003 to 2014 was clearly identified, by the view of reliable emission estimation and anthropogenic impacts. Multiple satellite products, field survey, time varying biomass loading data and measured emission factors were adopted to better estimating BB emission and reducing the uncertainty. Social-economic analysis was added to assess the anthropogenic impacts on high emission variation quantitatively. Results showed that the cumulative BB emissions of OC, EC, CH4, NOX, NMVOC, SO2, NH3, CO, CO2, PM2.5 and PM10 during 2003-2014 were 1.6 × 104, 5.64 × 103, 3.57 × 104, 1.7 × 104, 5.44 × 104, 2.96 × 103, 6.77 × 103, 6.5 × 105, 1.15 × 107, 5.26 × 104 and 6.04 × 104 Gg, respectively. Crop straw burning (in-field and domestic) in northeast China plain (NEP), north China plain (NCP), northern arid and semiarid region and loess plateau were the key sources, averagely contributed 73% for all the pollutants emission. While domestic straw burning and firewood burning in Sichuan basin (SB), Yunnan-Guizhou plateau and southern China were main contributors, averagely accounting for 70% of all the pollutants emission. On regional level, high emissions were mainly found in SB, NCP and NEP. Temporally, high emissions were mainly found in crop sowing harvesting and heating seasons. From 2003 to 2014, the BB emission for different biomass species has changed significantly in different regions. High emission has gradually moved from SB to NCP and NEP. Firewood burning and domestic straw burning emission decreased by 47% and 14% in SB, respectively. In-field straw burning emission increased by 52% and 231% in NCP and NEP respectively and domestic straw burning emission increased by 62% in NEP. Emissions from heating season have decreased while emissions in corn harvest season were continuously increased. Analysis of Environmental kuznets curve, agricultural productivity level, human burning habits, rural energy structure and local control policies revealed the internal human driving strength of the variation for BB emission. The unbalanced development of social economy and the policy bias were primary drivers of limiting the BB management. BB emission will alleviate in NCP and aggravate in NEP. For the further emission reduction, effective measures for corn sources management, straw returning and rural energy utilization should be systematically considered. This research provides a clear evidence for the multi-year variation pattern of BB emissions, which is critical for pollution prediction, air quality modeling and targeted mitigation strategies for the key regions of China."

The primary objectives of this paper are to review what is known about Haiti's current toxicological hazards, with a focus on chronic food-borne aflatoxin exposure and heavy metal contamination of water resources, and to compare these with previous large-scale, acute exposures to toxic substances: the 1995-1996 diethylene glycol (DEG) intoxications and the 2000-2001 ackee fruit poisonings. MEDLINE/PUBMED and the library website of Cornell University were searched using the terms ""Haiti"" and either ""heavy metals,"" ""aflatoxin"", ""diethylene glycol"", or ""ackee"". The search was inclusive of articles from 1950 to 2012, and 15 out of the 37 returned were peer-reviewed articles offering original data or comprehensive discussion. One peer-reviewed article in press, two newspaper articles, two personal communications, and one book chapter from the personal databases of the authors were also referenced, making a total of 21 citations. Elevated concentrations of aflatoxins (greater than 20 μg/kg) were documented for staples of the Haitian food supply, most notably peanut butters and maize. Human exposure to aflatoxin was confirmed with analysis of aflatoxin blood biomarkers. The implications of aflatoxin exposure were reviewed in the light of Haiti's age-adjusted liver cancer risk - the highest in the Caribbean region. Measurement of heavy metals in Port-au-Prince ground water showed contamination of lead and chromium in excess of the US Environmental Protection Agency's 15 μg/L Action Level for lead and 100 μg/L Maximum Contamination Level Goal for total chromium. The DEG contamination of paracetamol (acetaminophen) containing products in 1995-1996 claimed the lives of 109 children and the 2000-2001 epidemic of ackee fruit poisoning resulted in 60 cases of intoxication. Lessons for the Haitian Government. The DEG and ackee epidemics overwhelmed local Haitian public health resources. Yet, periods of 8 and 4 months, respectively, passed before the Haitian government sought assistance following the initial poisonings. To our knowledge, the Haitian government did not enact policy to promote drug safety and prevent future poisonings. This will not likely change in the near future because of the state's finance and personnel crises. While protection of its people remains the prerogative of the Haitian government, it is extremely limited in managing chemical exposure to environmental toxins, including aflatoxin and heavy metals. The cases of DEG and ackee fruit poisoning demonstrate that environmental exposures to chemicals have occurred in Haiti. Current low-level exposures to aflatoxin and heavy metals highlight the risk that large-scale poisonings can occur. While awareness of toxicological hazards in Haiti must be acknowledged more widely within the government and non-governmental sectors, the lessons of these exposures are relevant to all developing countries where the capacity to discern and manage toxicological risks is absent or not yet effective."

Drought-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to stimulate aflatoxin production and regulate development in Aspergillus flavus , and may function in signaling with host plants. Here, we have performed global, untargeted metabolomics to better understand the role of aflatoxin production in oxidative stress responses, and also explore isolate-specific oxidative stress responses over time. Two field isolates of A. flavus , AF13 and NRRL3357, possessing high and moderate aflatoxin production, respectively, were cultured in medium with and without supplementation with 15mM H 2 O 2 , and mycelia were collected following 4 and 7 days in culture for global metabolomics. Overall, 389 compounds were described in the analysis which were examined for differential accumulation. Significant differences were observed in both isolates in response to oxidative stress and when comparing sampling time points. The moderate aflatoxin-producing isolate, NRRL3357, showed extensive stimulation of antioxidant mechanisms and pathways including polyamines metabolism, glutathione metabolism, TCA cycle, and lipid metabolism while the highly aflatoxigenic isolate, AF13, showed a less vigorous response to stress. Carbohydrate pathway levels also imply that carbohydrate repression and starvation may influence metabolite accumulation at the later timepoint. Higher conidial oxidative stress tolerance and antioxidant capacity in AF13 compared to NRRL3357, inferred from their metabolomic profiles and growth curves over time, may be connected to aflatoxin production capability and aflatoxin-related antioxidant accumulation. The coincidence of several of the detected metabolites in H 2 O 2 -stressed A. flavus and drought-stressed hosts suggests their potential role in the interaction between these organisms and their use as markers/targets to enhance host resistance through biomarker selection or genetic engineering. Aspergillus flavus is a fungal pathogen of several important crops including maize and peanut. This pathogen produces carcinogenic mycotoxins known as aflatoxins during infection of plant materials, and is particularly severe under drought stress conditions. This results in significant losses in crop value and poses a threat to food safety and security globally. To combat this, understanding how this fungus responds to environmental stresses related to drought can allow us to identify novel methods of mitigating aflatoxin contamination. Here, we analyzed the accumulation of a broad series of metabolites over time in two isolates of A. flavus with differing stress tolerance and aflatoxin production capabilities in response to drought-related oxidative stress. We identified several metabolites and mechanisms in A. flavus which allow it to cope with environmental oxidative stress and may influence aflatoxin production and fungal growth. These may serve as potential targets for selection in breeding programs for the development of new cultivars, or for alteration using genetic engineering approaches to mitigate excessive aflatoxin contamination under drought stress."

The group of carcinogenic N-nitrosamines is of especially dangerous. It is worth mentioning that currently there are no standards for their content in Vietnam. Therefore, to ensure the chemical safety of infant food, it is necessary to improve the control system, including the development of modern technical and methodological base. The aim of the research is the comparative assessment of contamination with highly toxic, N-nitrosoamines of baby canned meat and vegetable products by the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using an automatic solid-phase extraction system and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Material and methods. The objects of research were homogenized canned meat-vegetable products for baby nutrition - 21 samples taken from the distribution network of the Republic of Vietnam: vegetables and rice with chicken (sample No. 1); sweet corn with mashed potatoes and turkey (sample No. 2); potatoes with veal (sample No. 3); each species has 7 samples. Each food sample was analyzed thrice by two methods. At the Federal Center of Perm, the screening studies of canned foods were performed using GC/ MS with application of the automatic solid-phase extraction system (SPE) after distillation using alkaline catalysis at the sample preparation stage. At the National Institute of Food Control of Republic of Viеtnam, canned samples were studied using GC-MS/MS. The extraction method was developed on the base of QuEChERS-approach. Results and discussion. During the research, the following chemical contaminants were found in the canned samples: N-nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosodiethylamine, N-methylethyl nitrosoamine, N-dipropylnitrosoamine, N-dibutyl nitrosoamine, N-piperidinitrozoamine, N-pyrrolidinin nitrosoamine, N-morpholinithrosamine and N-diphenyl nitrosoamine. It was demonstrated that the results of quantitative determination of the content of N-nitrosoamines in canned meat of Vietnam producers obtained in different laboratories are comparable and have good validation characteristics for the determination of N-nitrosoamines in baby food. Thus, N-nitrosodimethylamine was detected by both methods in all analyzed samples in the concentration range from 0.00045 to 0.00077 mg/kg. Values exceeding the maximum permissible level of N-nitrosoamines (N-nitrosodimethylamine and N-nitrosodiethylamine) in canned meat and vegetable samples (0.001 mg/kg according to Technical Regulations of the Customs Union TR TC 021/ 2011 ""On Food Safety"") were not found. The application of low-resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and the use of an automatic SPE system made it possible to achieve high comparability of the results in chemical analysis of N-nitrosoamines in canned products obtained in the laboratory of the Center and the National Institute for Food Control of Vietnam. Conclusion. The executed studies indicate the need for further monitoring of the content of chemicals in baby products in order to justify methodological approaches to the analysis of the risk of the simultaneous effect of chemical contaminants on the health of children. In this regard, it seems extremely important and relevant issue of hygienic regulation of the content of the studied compounds in products for baby food."

However, these models did not characterize the likelihood of virus survival under various time and temperature processes that feed ingredients undergo before they are added to swine diets. Here, we developed a quantitative risk assessment model to estimate the probability that one or more corn or soybean meal ocean vessels (25,000 tonnes) contaminated with ASFV would be imported into the United States annually. This final probability estimate was conditionally based on five likelihoods: the probability of initial ASFV contamination (p0), ASFV inactivation during processing (p1) and transport (p2), recontamination (pR), and ASFV inactivation while awaiting customs clearance at United States entry (p3). The probability of ASFV inactivation was modelled using corn and soybean (extruded or solvent extracted) processing conditions (times and temperatures), D-values (time to reduce 90% or 1-log) estimated from studies of ASFV thermal inactivation in pork serum (p1), and survival in feed ingredients during transoceanic transport (p2 and p3). 'What-if' scenarios using deterministic values for p0 and pR (1%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) were used to explore their impact on risk. The model estimated complete inactivation of ASFV after extrusion or solvent extraction processes regardless of the initial ASFV contamination probability assumed. The value of recontamination (ranging from 1% to 75%) was highly influential on the risk of one ASFV-contaminated soybean meal vessel entering the United States. Median risk estimates ranged from 0.064% [0.006%-0.60%; 95% probability interval (PI)], assuming a pR of 1.0%, up to 4.67% (0.45%-36.50% 95% PI) assuming a pR of 75.0%. This means that at least one vessel with ASFV-contaminated soybean meal would be imported once every 1563-21 years, respectively. When all raw corn was assumed to be contaminated (p0 = 100%), and no recontamination was assumed to occur (pR = 0%), the median probability of one vessel with ASFV-contaminated corn entering the United States was 2.02% (0.28%-9.43% 95% PI) or once every 50 years. Values of recontamination between 1% and 75% did not substantially change the risk of corn. Days of transport, virus survival during transport (D-value), and number of vessels shipped were the parameters most influential for increased likelihood of a vessel with ASFV-contaminated soybean meal or corn entering the United States. The model helped to identify knowledge gaps that are most influential on output values and serves as a framework that could be updated and parameterized as new scientific information becomes available. We propose that the quantitative risk assessment model developed in this study can be used as a framework for estimating the risk of ASFV entry into the United States and other ASFV-free countries through other types of imported feed ingredients that may potentially become contaminated. Ultimately, this model can be used to develop risk mitigation strategies and critical control points for inactivating ASFV during feed ingredient processing, storage, and transport, and contribute to the design and implementation of biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction of ASFV into the United States and other ASFV-free countries."

{'wheat': ['Cd', 'Pb', 'Zn']}
{'corn': ['Cd', 'Cr']}</s>","Constant use of treated wastewater (TWW) for irrigation over prolonged periods may cause buildup of heavy metals up to toxic levels for plants and animals, and entails environmental hazards in different aspects. However, application of TWW on agricultural land might be an effective and sustainable strategy in arid and semi-arid countries where fresh water resources are under great pressure, as long as potential harmful effects on the environment including soil, plants, and fresh water resources, and health risks to humans are minimized. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of deep emitters on limiting potential heavy metal accumulation in soils and grains, and health risk under drip irrigation with treated municipal wastewater. A field experiment was conducted according to a split block design with two treatments (fresh and wastewater) and three sub-treatments (0, 15, and 30 cm depth of emitters) in four replicates on a sandy loam Calcic Argigypsids, in Esfahan, Iran. The annual rainfall is about 123 mm, mean annual ETo is 1457 mm, and the elevation is 1590 m above sea level. A two-crop rotation of wheat (Triticum spp. ) and corn (Zea mays) was established on each plot with wheat growing from February to June and corn from July to September. Soil samples were collected before planting and after harvesting for each crop in each year. Edible grain samples of corn and wheat were collected at harvest. Elemental concentrations (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni) in soil and grains were determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results showed that the concentrations of heavy metals in the wastewater-irrigated soils were not significantly different (P > 0.05) compared with the freshwater-irrigated soils. No significant difference (P > 0.05) in heavy metal content in soil between different depths of emitters was found. A pollution load index (PLI) showed that there was no substantial buildup of heavy metals in the wastewater-irrigated soils compared to the freshwater-irrigated soils. Cu, Pb, and Zn concentrations in wheat and corn grains were within the permissible US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits, but concentrations of Cd (in wheat and corn) and Cr (in corn) were above the safe limits of the EPA. In addition, concentrations of Ni in wheat and corn seeds were several folds higher than the EPA standards. A health risk index (HRI) which is usually adopted to assess the health risk to hazard materials in foods showed values higher than 1 for Cd, particularly for wheat grain (HRI >2.5). Results also showed that intake of Cu through consumption of edible wheat grains posed a relatively high potential health risk to children (HRI >1.4), whereas children might also be exposed to health risk from Cd and Cr from corn grains (HRI >1.4). Based on aforementioned results, it can be concluded that the emitter depth in drip irrigation does not play a significant role in the accumulation of heavy metals from TWW in our sandy loam soil. Although their accumulation in the soil was limited and similar to using freshwater, uptake of Cd and Cr by wheat and corn was relatively large and hence resulted in health risk. The results suggest that more attention should be directed towards cultivation of other crops with drip irrigation system for a safe and more productive use of wastewater for irrigation. Alternatively, methods that filter the wastewater before it enters the soil environment might be an option that needs further investigation."

Past research focused mainly on the environmental impact, and we show for the first time what the human health risk through consumption of contaminated food crops is in these communities. This study was designed to determine the level of Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs) contamination in pond water, soil, and food crops and assess the health risk of inhabitants in the abandoned tin mining community in Bokkos LGA. Samples of the mining pond water, soil, and selected food crops from farms irrigated with the pond water: bitter leaf (Vernonia amygdalina), pepper (Piper nigrum), okra (Albelmoschus esculentus), maize (Zea mays), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), and Irish potato (Solanum tuberosum) were analyzed for each of the eight PTEs (viz. Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn, Cd, and Pb) using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The results obtained showed that the levels of all the PTEs analyzed in the soil, pond water, and selected food crops except for Fe and Mn in soil and Cd in sweet potato were greater than their corresponding background area values (p < 0.05). Also, the mean concentrations of all the PTEs except for Cu in pond water were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the WHO maximum permissible limit. With the exception of Fe, Ni, and Zn for pepper and okra, Cu and Fe for maize grains as well as Cu, Ni, and Zn for sweet and Irish potatoes and Fe and Cd for sweet potato, the mean concentrations of PTEs in the food crops were significantly higher than WHO maximum permissible limit. The EF values of Cd (0.39); Cu (3.59) and Ni (2.81); Cr (9.38) and Pb (17.84); and Mn (178.13) and Zn (83.22) classified the soil as minimally, moderately, significantly, and extremely highly enriched, respectively. The PI values of all the PTEs in the soil studied were all greater than 5, indicating that the soils were severely contaminated. There was evidence that food crops significantly bioaccumulated PTEs either as a result of contaminated soil and/or irrigation water. The bioaccumulation was not uniform and was dominated by transfer from the polluted irrigation water. The bitter leaf, okra, and to some extent maize had the highest transfer of PTEs, and Mn, Cu, and Zn had the highest bioaccumulation in the food crops investigated. The hazardous index (HI) for the eight PTEs through the consumption of food crops was 107 for children and 33 for adults which greatly exceeded the recommended limit of 1, thus indicating that possible health risks exist for both local children and adults. For every PTE, the values of HI for children are many-fold higher than those for adults, which is of particular concern due to the high HI values for Pb found for maize consumption, a typical staple food. The cancer risk values for Cr and Ni for all the food crops were within 10-3-10-1 which is several fold higher than the permissible limits (10-6 and < 10-4) indicating the high carcinogenic risk. It can be concluded based on the results and risk assessment provided by this study that human exposure to mining pond water and soil in farms around the mining pond through the food chain suggests the high vulnerability of the local community to PTE toxicity. Long-term preventive measures to safeguard the health of the residents need to be put in place."

In recent years, Pakistan has been facing an increased mycotoxin contamination in maize caused mainly by Aspergillus spp. Information on the occurrence and precise identification of Aspergillus spp. in maize is an important step to mitigate the impact of mycotoxins and enhance food safety in Pakistan. During 2016, harvested maize cobs of 15 varieties were obtained from the Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan. To isolate the pathogen, grains from 30 cobs of each cultivar were collected, surface sterilized, placed onto potato dextrose agar in Petri plates, and the plates incubated at 26°C. Cultural and morphological characteristics studies showed that 10 to 15% of samples of each genotype were infected by Aspergillus niger. Fungal colonies were white first and then covered with a dense layer of conidiophores and conidia. The conidial heads were radiate, vesicles, and covered with irregular metulae and phialides. Conidia were globose or subglobose (3 to 4.8 μm in diameter), dark brown to black, with rough cell walls. The morpho-cultural characters were in compliance with the description of A. niger (Ahmed et al. 1993). For molecular identification, genomic DNA of four representative isolates was extracted using DNAzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, U. S. A. ). PCR amplification and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-rDNA, β-tubulin (BenA), partial RNA polymerase II largest subunit (RPB2), and translation elongation factor-1 alpha (TEF-1α) gene regions were performed. Primers were ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), Bt2a/Bt2b (Glass et al. 1995), RPB2-5F/RPB2-7cR (Liu et al. 1999), and A-EF_F/A-EF_R (Perrone et al. 2011), respectively. The obtained sequences were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers MN922042.1, MN922043.1, MN922044.1, and MN922045.1 for ITS-rDNA; MT117920.1, MT117921.1, MT117922.1, and MT117923.1 for the BenA; MT318284.1, MT318285.1, MT318286.1, and MT318287.1 for RPB2; and MT318307.1, MT318308.1, MT318309.1, and MT318310.1 for TEF-1α. BLASTn analysis showed 99% identity with submitted sequence of A. niger for ITS rDNA, BenA, RBP2, and TEF-1α. To confirm Koch’s postulates, maize cultivars were grown in the research field of the Department of Plant Pathology, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan. For inoculation, a spore suspension was prepared by adding distilled water to Petri plate of A. niger culture to dissolve and harvest the spores. The concentration of the spore inoculum used was determined with a hemocytometer and adjusted to 1 × 10⁶ spores/ml in sterile 0.01% Triton X-100. Using a 10-ml syringe the top ears of maize were inoculated at 30 to 35°C with A. niger at milk growth stage by using 0.5 to 1 ml of inoculum per ear. After 14 days, disease symptoms similar to those observed in the field appeared in all inoculated but not in uninoculated ears of maize. A. niger had colonized the ears, as evidenced by visible sporulation on wounded kernels. These tests were repeated twice in the field, and Koch’s postulates were satisfied after reisolating the A. niger from the inoculated maize. A. niger contamination in maize was previously reported in the United States (Wicklow et al. 1987); however, to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of A. niger causing preharvest ear rot of maize in Pakistan. This finding will help to plan effective disease management strategies against preharvest ear rot of maize in Pakistan."

In some countries, including Belgium, the load with the biocide tributyltin (TBT) from ship coatings prohibits the dumping of harbour sludge into the sea. Land-based dumping is a commonly used alternative. This research investigated the feasibility to use land-deposited harbour sludge for plant production. In a field trial, the growth of 38 more or less salt-tolerant plant species on low and high TBT-contaminated sediments was studied. The elimination of TBT from sludge with and without vegetation was compared. The uptake of TBT and its degradation products di- and monobutyltin (DBT and MBT) into harvest products under field conditions was determined. EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP: Sediments dredged in May 2003 from the brackish waters of the port of Antwerp were analysed in the laboratory for soil texture, pH, electroconductivity, sodium, magnesium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, nitrate, total nitrogen, chloride, sulphur and the organotins TBT, DBT and MBT. The sediments were lagooned for one year to dewater, desalinate and improve their structure. Salt-tolerant domestic and wild plants were selected and sown in May 2004. In August 2004, plants were harvested and the produced biomass was determined. Samples were taken from vegetated and non-vegetated top and bottom sediments and from plants growing above soil and analysed for TBT, DBT and MBT. The fresh sediments showed a good supply with nutrients and a neutral pH, but were rather saline (EC 14 mS cm(-1) of the saturated paste extract). The salinity decreased to 3.7 mS cm(-1) during lagoonation. The high and the low contaminated sediment had initially 43 and 1.6 mg TBT kg(-1) dry weight, respectively. Besides TBT, several other contaminants were present in the sediments at critical levels. The biomass production of the plant species from the field trial ranged from 0.2 to 13 tons dry mass per hectare. Plants performing excellently were barley, sorghum, rape seed, a clover/grass mix and reed. If at all, a positive influence of TBT on plant growth was seen. TBT was degraded significantly faster (>40%) below barley. The uptake of TBT, DBT and MBT into stem and leaves of reed, grass and clover was very low, but measurable and not related to concentrations in soil. No uptake of TBT or its metabolites into corn of barley was found. This study confirmed former results: the toxicity of TBT to higher plants is low, and even high levels in soils would not be a hindrance for crop production. The removal of TBT seemed to be increased by both lagooning and plant growth, although the target values for sea dumping in use in certain European countries were not reached. A plausible explanation for the faster degradation of TBT under vegetation is that oxygen is a limiting factor, and plants dewater the soil, thus aerating it. The uptake of the organotins TBT, DBT and MBT into harvest products is probably due to attached soil particles. To summarize, barley was the optimal species: it grew very well despite the salinity of the dredged sediments, it had a significantly positive effect on TBT removal; it showed no measurable uptake of TBT or the other butyltins into the harvested product; and it is a cash crop well established in European agriculture. The amounts of dredged sediments are high, and good soils are becoming increasingly rare. The feasibility of using dredged sediments for non-food production, such as energy crops, should be investigated by a critical risk assessment."

The production of barley in the 2016 to 2017 growing season reached a record yield of almost 400,000 metric tons (USDA 2017). Aspergillus contamination has been rare in the agroecological conditions of cereal-growing areas in Serbia. Changes in climatic factors, such as occurrence of high temperatures and prolonged droughts, increased frequency of Aspergillus spp. Species Aspergillus parasiticus was isolated from maize grain for the first time in Serbia in 2012 and from wheat grains in 2017 (Nikolic et al. 2018). We hypothesized that these pathogens can also be present in barley fields in Serbia. Barley spikes exhibiting bleaching were sampled at the beginning of June 2017 grown in northern Serbia. In severe infections, barley spikes get a dry look with awns that stand upright and firm. The incidence of the disease of the bleached spiked in the field was 15 to 20%. From each representative sample, 100 shriveled grains were collected. After surface sterilization with bleach/distilled water 1:3, 100 grains per sample (10 per Petri dish) were placed on potato dextrose agar and incubated at 25°C for 7 days. After isolation, 50% of isolates were identified as Alternaria spp. , 20% as Fusarium spp. , approximately 15% as Aspergillus spp. In order to reliably identify individual species of fungi, the fragments of colonies were transferred to malt extract agar (MEA) and Czapek yeast agar (CYA) and incubated in the dark for 7 days. The fungal colonies were dark green. The reverse side was pale yellow. The average colony diameter was 65 mm. Conidia were spherical and rough with thick walls. The average size of conidia was 5.1 µm. Colonies were floccose and thin on MEA and CYA. Based on growth and morphological characteristics, isolates were determined as A. parasiticus (Pitt and Hocking 2009). Molecular detection of Aspergillus species was done by using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the aflR-aflJ (genes for aflatoxin biosynthesis) intergenic spacer. The restriction enzyme BglII was able to cut the PCR product of A. parasiticus at one restriction site, resulting in two fragments of 363 and 311 bp (El Khoury et al. 2011). A. parasiticus CBS 100926 was used as a reference isolate. The pathogenicity of 20 isolates was verified on a group of 20 randomly selected spikes in four replicates (Mesterházy et al. 1999). A 7-day-old culture of each isolate was used for the preparation of the spore suspension (1 × 10⁶ spores/ml). Inoculation was carried out after 50% of plants reached the anthesis stage. Groups of 20 selected spikes were sprayed from all sides with 20 ml of fungal spore suspension. Control spikes were inoculated by applying an equal amount of sterile distilled water. The infection rate was estimated after 3 weeks on a 1 to 7 scale, with 1 = 0 to 5%, 2 = 5 to 15%, 3 = 15 to 30%, 4 = 30 to 50%, 5 = 50 to 75%, 6 = 75 to 90%, and 7 = 90 to 100% infected spike area. The average infection rate was 3.2. The pathogen was reisolated from the inoculated spikes and identified as A. parasiticus, with the aim to confirm Koch’s postulates. Developed symptoms were similar to those observed on spikes collected from the field. Control spikes did not show any symptoms of the disease. These results confirmed the pathogenicity of A. parasiticus on H. vulgare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the occurrence of A. parasiticus on barley grain in Serbia. Because A. parasiticus is known to be a severe aflatoxin producer and climatic changes can increase the frequency of this fungus, further studies are necessary to improve strategies for food safety and quality."

Those who work in agriculture and are regularly exposed to pesticides are the most impacted. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that three million severe pesticide poisoning episodes occur globally each year, with at least 300.000 deaths and 99% of cases occurring in low- and middle-income nations. The effects of longer-term exposure to pesticides on health are not yet precisely estimated. To this end, the objective of this study is to assess the knowledge of pesticide residues and common pesticides in grain-based food (brown and white beans, yellow and white maize, brown millet and rice) about pesticide use in selected markets of Southwest Nigeria. The markets were Oja-titun (market) Ile-Ife, Osun; Alesinloye Market Ibadan, Oyo; Oja Oba, Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti; and Oja Oba, Akure Ondo State. The identification and quantification of pesticide residues was done using a Varian 3800/4000 gas chromatograph mass spectrometer while 60 structured questionnaires were administered to respondents including food merchants, buyers/consumers as well as food vendors. A total of 240 respondents were selected from four states (Ado-Ekiti, Ibadan, Osun and Ondo) with the aid of structured questionnaire and interview guide using purposive sampling technique. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Up to 50.4% never read instructions on pesticide application while a shared 24.8% read them always and occasionally. The number of respondents who never read the instructions were particularly high in Ekiti and Ondo, up to 52.5% of the respondents in Ekiti do not know whether or not they are exposed to pesticides during application. Also, majority of the respondents never attended any professional training on pesticide application, this amounted to 79.3%. Most people were not aware that unsafe pesticide application is harmful to human health. Similarly, a wide variety of symptoms were reported by respondents following pesticide application or consumption of grains, these included headaches and dizziness, itching and redness of the eyes, skin allergy, diarrhea, and stomach disorder, vomiting and loss of appetite, weakness of the body, asthma, permanent skin patches, shortness of breath, excessive sweating. Millet recorded the highest number of OCP residues while maize had the lowest. On the contrary, maize had the highest number of OPP and carbamate residues while millet had the lowest number of OPP residues. Meanwhile, maize, rice and beans had only one carbamate pesticide residue. According to the study’s conclusions, farmers who can only get information from agricultural extension officials should receive urgent and immediate attention for raising awareness. Additionally, extensive IPM training programs must be created with the intention of disseminating precautions for protecting human health and a healthy agro-ecosystem. In order to find more effective pest management methods that utilize less pesticides, it is crucial to reevaluate the pesticide residues and common pesticides found in grains in the targeted markets. To reduce farmers’ exposure to pesticides, it is also required to establish personal protective measures, special educational initiatives, and legislation promoting the use of safer pesticides. This study gives policymakers a comprehensive understanding of the ways that may be utilized to close the significant knowledge gap on pesticide residues in grains and provides an insight into the knowledge of pesticide residues and common pesticides in grains."

The relationship between the uptake of Cd, Pb, Zn, and As by maize plants and the morphological content of heavy metals in the soil was also discussed through principal component analysis and correlation analysis of the concentrations of eight heavy metals, including Cd, Hg, As, Pb, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn. The results showed that:① the distribution pattern of Cd and Zn contents in different parts of the maize plant was as follows:upper stalk>lower stalk>root>seed, the distribution pattern of Pb was As follows:root>lower stalk>upper stalk>seed, and the As distribution pattern was:root>upper stalk>lower stalk>seed. The different distribution patterns were closely related to the accumulation characteristics of the crop itself and the environmental activity of Cd, Pb, Zn, and As in the soil of the study area. ② There were significant differences in Cd and Pb accumulation among 22 maize cultivars due to their genetic background (P<0.05), which showed four trends:Cd and Pb compound high-accumulation varieties, single Cd or Pb low-accumulation varieties (low Cd and high Pb, low Pb and high Cd), and Cd and Pb compound low-accumulation varieties. Among them, the content of Cd in the grain of the three varieties exceeded the national food safety standard, and the content of Cd in the stem and leaf of 14 varieties exceeded the national food health standard. The Pb content in stems, leaves, and grains of all cultivars did not exceed the standard, but the Pb content in grains of some cultivars was close to the limit and had the risk of exceeding the standard. The content of As in the stem, leaf, and grain of different maize varieties was much lower than the standard limit value, showing a stable low-accumulation characteristic. The content of Zn in the stem and leaf of different maize varieties increased with the increase in the content of Zn in soil, but the content of Zn in grain remained within the threshold of normal plant growth. ③ Cd, Pb, Zn, and As in maize plants in the study area had a certain homology and were mainly affected by the excessive levels of Cd, Pb, Zn, and As pollutants in the soil. This showed that anthropogenic sources were brought about by mine extraction and tailings stockpiles, whereas Cu elements in maize plants were affected by certain anthropogenic pollution sources, though to a limited extent. Hg, Ni, and Cr in maize plants had a certain homology; this showed the natural source of soil parent material and weathering product accumulation. ④ The contents of Cd, Pb, Zn, and As elements in various parts of the corn plant, as well as the contents of Cr and Ni elements all had a very significant positive correlation (P<0.01). The transport mechanisms of Cd, Pb, Zn, and As elements in the plant may have a common. However, there was a synergistic effect in the migration from the root of the corn to the upper part of the ground, and the same was true for the elements of Cr and Ni. The elements of Hg and Cd, Pb, Zn, and As in the corn stems and leaves and Hg and Cd, Hg, As, Pb, Cr, Ni, and Zn in grains all showed certain antagonistic effects. ⑤ The comparison method simultaneously satisfied the following requirements:the contents of Cd, Pb, and As in stems and leaves did not exceed the national food hygiene standards, and the contents of Cd, Pb, and As in the grains did not exceed the national food safety standards. The cluster analysis of Cd, Pb, and As in grains was a low-accumulation group, and the enrichment and transport coefficients of Cd, Pb, and As in the stems and leaves and grains were low as the optimal conditions. C18 (Xianyu 335) could be selected as the optimal maize variety with low accumulation of Cd, Pb, and As and normal Zn content in grain, which is suitable for promoting and applying in the heavy metal complex-polluted farmland around industrial and mining enterprises in north China."

Previously, common-pool resources like forests and grasslands have been either gazetted for conservation or leased for agriculture, the latter in particular for large-scale sugarcane production. Satisfying the increasing consumer demand for grassland or forestry products like wild mushrooms as food or medicine, requires innovative ethno-biological and industry development strategies to improve production capacity, while easing the pressure on diminishing natural resources and averting ecosystems degradation. METHODS:This case study addresses traditional knowledge systems for artisanal mycoculture to identify cultivation practices that enhance sustainable utilization of natural resources. Multi-scalar stakeholder engagement across government and community sectors identified artisanal mushroom producers across five districts in Uganda. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews characterized artisanal production methods and identified locally used substrates for cultivation of different mushroom species. RESULTS:Artisanal practices were characterized for the cultivation of six wild saprophytic mushroom species including Volvariella speciosa (akasukusuku), two Termitomyces sp. (obunegyere and another locally unnamed species), Agaricus sp. (ensyabire) and Agrocybe sp. (emponzira), and one exotic Pleurotus sp. (oyster) that are used as food or medicine. The substrates used for each species differed according to the mushroom's mode of decomposition, those being the following: tertiary decomposers such as those growing under rotting tree stumps or logs from forestry activity like the Agrocybe sp. known as emponzira which grows in forests, thickets, or near homesteads where big logs of hardwood have been left to rot. Also pieces of firewood are chipped off whenever need arises thus providing fuel; secondary decomposers growing on naturally composted grass associated with termites like the Termitomyces sp. known as obunegyere growing in protected sites in gardens, composted cattle manure for Agaricus sp. known as ensyabire in the kraal area where cattle manure is plenty, composted maize cobs for a locally unnamed Agaricus sp. on heaped cobs placed near homesteads; and primary decomposers growing on waste sorghum from brewing the traditional alcoholic drink, muramba for Pleurotus sp. (oyster), and banana and spear grass residue from banana juice processing like the Volvariella speciosa known as akasukusuku because it is associated with the banana plantation locally known in the Luganda language as olusuku and is usually heaped under ficus trees. Management practices also varied based on mode of decomposition and other ecological requirements such as the following: zero tillage and minimal disturbance in areas where obunegyere grow, heaping banana and spear grass residues under the cool ficus trees which also keep them away from banana stump that may cause infestation with nematodes and insects. Even within the generic practices accessibility by the users is critical for example placing logs near homes where children can use them to play, they can be used as fire wood and to even get off-season mushroom as household waste water can make the mushrooms grow. CONCLUSIONS:Our description of artisanal mycoculture methods that respond to conservation and utilization pressures, demonstrates the value of addressing traditional knowledge to improve ethno-biology and mycoculture industry practice. Traditional communities engage in multiple technological and organizational innovations and practices for sustainability and in the case of mushroom production to conserve the environment and culture, ensure variety, food and nutrition security, and income. The results of this study present opportunities to preserve ecosystem quality while developing an artisanal mycoculture system. They have also identified aspects of artisanal mycoculture that most urgently require further ethno-biological study and industry development. Future research and industry development can utilize the result of this study to boost artisanal production of wild saprophytic mushrooms in Sub-Saharan countries, for food or medicinal consumption, and environment conservation. Further development of production efficiencies in context with sustainable natural resource management is recommended."

Its use potentially overlaps with the ranges of listed (threatened and endangered) species. In response to registration review in the context of the Endangered Species Act, we evaluated potential direct and indirect impacts of atrazine on listed species and designated critical habitats. Atrazine has been widely studied, extensive environmental monitoring and toxicity data sets are available, and the spatial and temporal uses on major crops are well characterized. Ranges of listed species are less well-defined, resulting in overly conservative designations of ""May Effect"". Preferences for habitat and food sources serve to limit exposure among many listed animal species and animals are relatively insensitive. Atrazine does not bioaccumulate, further diminishing exposures among consumers and predators. Because of incomplete exposure pathways, many species can be eliminated from consideration for direct effects. It is toxic to plants, but even sensitive plants tolerate episodic exposures, such as those occurring in flowing waters. Empirical data from long-term monitoring programs and realistic field data on off-target deposition of drift indicate that many other listed species can be removed from consideration because exposures are below conservative toxicity thresholds for direct and indirect effects. Combined with recent mitigation actions by the registrant, this review serves to refine and focus forthcoming listed species assessment efforts for atrazine.

Overall,the collective evidence from the modeling and field study lines of evidence indicate that flowable and granular CPY do not pose significant risks to the bird communities foraging in agro-ecosystems in the United States. The available information indicates that avian incidents resulting from the legal, registered uses of CPY have been very infrequent since 2002 (see SI Appendix 3). The small number of recent incidents suggests that the current labels for CPY are generally protective of birds. However, incident data are uncertain because of the difficulties associated with finding dead birds in the field and linking any mortality observed to CPY. Plowable CPY is registered for a variety of crops in the United States including alfalfa, brassica vegetables, citrus, corn, cotton, grape, mint, onion, peanut, pome and stone fruits, soybean, sugar beet, sunflower, sweet potato, tree nuts, and wheat under the trade name Lorsban Advanced. The major routes of exposure for birds to flowable CPY were consumption of treated dietary items and drinking water. The Liquid Pesticide Avian Risk Assessment Model (Liquid PARAM) was used to simulate avian ingestion of CPY by these routes of exposure. For acute exposure,Liquid PARAM estimated the maximum retained dose in each of 20 birds on each of1,000 fields that were treated with CPY over the 60-d period following initial application. The model used a 1-h time step. For species lacking acceptable acute oral toxicity data (all focal species except northern bobwhite (C. virginianus) and redwinged blackbird (A. phoeniceus)), a species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approach was used to generate hypothetical dose-response curves assuming high, median and low sensitivity to CPY. For acute risk, risk curves were generated for each use pattern and exposure scenario. The risk curves show the relationship between exceedence probability and percent mortality. The results of the Liquid PARAM modeling exercise indicate that flow able CPY poses an acute risk to some bird species, particularly those species that are highly sensitive and that forage extensively in crops with high maximum application rates (e. g. , grapefruit, orange). Overall, most bird species would not experience significant mortality as a result of exposure to flowable CPY. The results of a number of field studies conducted at application rates comparable to those on the Lorsban Advanced label indicate that flowable CPY rarely causes avian mortality. The results of the field studies suggest that Liquid PARAM is likely over-estimating acute risk to birds for flowable CPY. For chronic exposure, Liquid PARAM estimated the maximum total daily intake (TDI) over a user-specified exposure duration (28-d in the case of CPY). The maximum average TDI was compared to the chronic NOEL and LOEL from the most sensitive species tested for CPY, the mallard. This comparison was done for each of the 20 birds in each of the 1000 fields simulated in Liquid PARAM. The outpu· ~ are estimates of the probabilities of exceeding the NOEL and LOEL. Liquid PAkAM did not predict significant adverse effects resulting from chronic exposure to flowable CPY. The small number of incidents (2) involving CPY reported since 2002 suggests that the current labels for CPY are generally protective of birds. Granular CPY is registered for a wide variety of crops including brassica vegetables, corn, onion, peanut, sugar beet, sunflower, and tobacco under the trade name Lorsban 15G. Consumption of grit is required by many birds to aid in digestion of hard dietary items such as seeds and insects. Because CPY granules are in the same size range as natural grit particles consumed by birds, there is a potential for birds to mistakenly ingest granular CPY instead of natural grit. We developed the Granular Pesticide Avian Risk Model (GranPARAM) to simulate grit ingestion behavior by birds. The model accounts for proportion of time that birds forage for grit in treated fields, relative proportions of natural grit versus pesticide granules onthe surface of treated fields, rates of ingestion of grit, attractiveness of pesticide granules relative to natural grit and so on. For CPY, each model simulation included20 birds on each of 1,000 fields to capture variability in rates of ingestion of grit and for aging behavior between birds within a focal species, and variability in soil composition between fields for the selected use pattern. The estimated dose for each birdwas compared with randomly chosen doses from relevant dose-response curves forCPY. Our analysis for a wide variety of use patterns on the Lorsban 15G label found that granular CPY poses little risk of causing mortality to bird species that frequent treated fields immediately after application. The predictions of the model have been confirmed in several avian field studies conducted with Lorsban 15G at application rates similar to or exceeding maximum application rates on the Lorsban 15G label."

The chemicals, the chemicals, the chemicals, food, food, the chemicals.</s>","The development and use of entomopathogens as classical, conservation and augmentative biological control agents have included a number of successes and some setbacks in the past 1years. In this forum paper we present current information on development, use and future directions of insect-specific viruses, bacteria, fungi and nematodes as components of integrated pest management strategies for control of arthropod pests of crops, forests, urban habitats, and insects of medical and veterinary importance. Insect pathogenic viruses are a fruitful source of microbial control agents (MCAs), particularly for the control of lepidopteran pests. Most research is focused on the baculoviruses, important pathogens of some globally important pests for which control has become difficult due to either pesticide resistance or pressure to reduce pesticide residues. Baculoviruses are accepted as safe, readily mass produced, highly pathogenic and easily formulated and applied control agents. New baculovirus products are appearing in many countries and gaining an increased market share. However, the absence of a practical in vitro mass production system, generally higher production costs, limited post application persistence, slow rate of kill and high host specificity currently contribute to restricted use in pest control. Overcoming these limitations are key research areas for which progress could open up use of insect viruses to much larger markets. A small number of entomopathogenic bacteria have been commercially developed for control of insect pests. These include several Bacillus thuringiensis sub-species, Lysinibacillus (Bacillus) sphaericus, Paenibacillus spp. and Serratia entomophila. B. thuringiensis sub-species kurstaki is the most widely used for control of pest insects of crops and forests, and B. thuringiensis sub-species israelensis and L. sphaericus are the primary pathogens used for control of medically important pests including dipteran vectors. These pathogens combine the advantages of chemical pesticides and MCAs: they are fast acting, easy to produce at a relatively low cost, easy to formulate, have a long shelf life and allow delivery using conventional application equipment and systemics (i. e. in transgenic plants). Unlike broad spectrum chemical pesticides, B. thuringiensis toxins are selective and negative environmental impact is very limited. Of the several commercially produced MCAs, B. thuringiensis (Bt) has more than 50% of market share. Extensive research, particularly on the molecular mode of action of Bt toxins, has been conducted over the past two decades. The Bt genes used in insect-resistant transgenic crops belong to the Cry and vegetative insecticidal protein families of toxins. Bt has been highly efficacious in pest management of corn and cotton, drastically reducing the amount of broad spectrum chemical insecticides used while being safe for consumers and non-target organisms. Despite successes, the adoption of Bt crops has not been without controversy. Although there is a lack of scientific evidence regarding their detrimental effects, this controversy has created the widespread perception in some quarters that Bt crops are dangerous for the environment. In addition to discovery of more efficacious isolates and toxins, an increase in the use of Bt products and transgenes will rely on innovations in formulation, better delivery systems and ultimately, wider public acceptance of transgenic plants expressing insect-specific Bt toxins. Fungi are ubiquitous natural entomopathogens that often cause epizootics in host insects and possess many desirable traits that favor their development as MCAs. Presently, commercialized microbial pesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi largely occupy niche markets. A variety of molecular tools and technologies have recently allowed reclassification of numerous species based on phylogeny, as well as matching anamorphs (asexual forms) and teleomorphs (sexual forms) of several entomopathogenic taxa in the Phylum Ascomycota. Although these fungi have been traditionally regarded exclusively as pathogens of arthropods, recent studies have demonstrated that they occupy a great diversity of ecological niches. Entomopathogenic fungi are now known to be plant endophytes, plant disease antagonists, rhizosphere colonizers, and plant growth promoters. These newly understood attributes provide possibilities to use fungi in multiple roles. In addition to arthropod pest control, some fungal species could simultaneously suppress plant pathogens and plant parasitic nematodes as well as promote plant growth. A greater understanding of fungal ecology is needed to define their roles in nature and evaluate their limitations in biological control. More efficient mass production, formulation and delivery systems must be devised to supply an ever increasing market. More testing under field conditions is required to identify effects of biotic and abiotic factors on efficacy and persistence. Lastly, greater attention must be paid to their use within integrated pest management programs; in particular, strategies that incorporate fungi in combination with arthropod predators and parasitoids need to be defined to ensure compatibility and maximize efficacy. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) in the genera Steinernema and Heterorhabditis are potent MCAs. Substantial progress in research and application of EPNs has been made in the past decade. The number of target pests shown to be susceptible to EPNs has continued to increase. Advancements in this regard primarily have been made in soil habitats where EPNs are shielded from environmental extremes, but progress has also been made in use of nematodes in above-ground habitats owing to the development of improved protective formulations. Progress has also resulted from advancements in nematode production technology using both in vivo and in vitro systems; novel application methods such as distribution of infected host cadavers; and nematode strain improvement via enhancement and stabilization of beneficial traits. Innovative research has also yielded insights into the fundamentals of EPN biology including major advances in genomics, nematode-bacterial symbiont interactions, ecological relationships, and foraging behavior. Additional research is needed to leverage these basic findings toward direct improvements in microbial control."

","In this report the various elements of the safety and nutritional assessment procedure for genetically modified (GM) plant derived food and feed are discussed, in particular the potential and limitations of animal feeding trials for the safety and nutritional testing of whole GM food and feed. The general principles for the risk assessment of GM plants and derived food and feed are followed, as described in the EFSA guidance document of the EFSA Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms. In Section 1 the mandate, scope and general principles for risk assessment of GM plant derived food and feed are discussed. Products under consideration are food and feed derived from GM plants, such as maize, soybeans, oilseed rape and cotton, modified through the introduction of one or more genes coding for agronomic input traits like herbicide tolerance and/or insect resistance. Furthermore GM plant derived food and feed, which have been obtained through extensive genetic modifications targeted at specific alterations of metabolic pathways leading to improved nutritional and/or health characteristics, such as rice containing beta-carotene, soybeans with enhanced oleic acid content, or tomato with increased concentration of flavonoids, are considered. The safety assessment of GM plants and derived food and feed follows a comparative approach, i. e. the food and feed are compared with their non-GM counterparts in order to identify intended and unintended (unexpected) differences which subsequently are assessed with respect to their potential impact on the environment, safety for humans and animals, and nutritional quality. Key elements of the assessment procedure are the molecular, compositional, phenotypic and agronomic analysis in order to identify similarities and differences between the GM plant and its near isogenic counterpart. The safety assessment is focussed on (i) the presence and characteristics of newly expressed proteins and other new constituents and possible changes in the level of natural constituents beyond normal variation, and on the characteristics of the GM food and feed, and (ii) the possible occurrence of unintended (unexpected) effects in GM plants due to genetic modification. In order to identify these effects a comparative phenotypic and molecular analysis of the GM plant and its near isogenic counterpart is carried out, in parallel with a targeted analysis of single specific compounds, which represent important metabolic pathways in the plant like macro and micro nutrients, known anti-nutrients and toxins. Significant differences may be indicative of the occurrence of unintended effects, which require further investigation. Section 2 provides an overview of studies performed for the safety and nutritional assessment of whole food and feed. Extensive experience has been built up in recent decades from the safety and nutritional testing in animals of irradiated foods, novel foods and fruit and vegetables. These approaches are also relevant for the safety and nutritional testing of whole GM food and feed. Many feeding trials have been reported in which GM foods like maize, potatoes, rice, soybeans and tomatoes have been fed to rats or mice for prolonged periods, and parameters such as body weight, feed consumption, blood chemistry, organ weights, histopathology etc have been measured. The food and feed under investigation were derived from GM plants with improved agronomic characteristics like herbicide tolerance and/or insect resistance. The majority of these experiments did not indicate clinical effects or histopathological abnormalities in organs or tissues of exposed animals. In some cases adverse effects were noted, which were difficult to interpret due to shortcomings in the studies. Many studies have also been carried out with feed derived from GM plants with agronomic input traits in target animal species to assess the nutritive value of the feed and their performance potential. Studies in sheep, pigs, broilers, lactating dairy cows, and fish, comparing the in vivo bioavailability of nutrients from a range of GM plants with their near isogenic counterpart and commercial varieties, showed that they were comparable with those for near isogenic non-GM lines and commercial varieties. In Section 3 toxicological in vivo, in silico, and in vitro test methods are discussed which may be applied for the safety and nutritional assessment of specific compounds present in food and feed or of whole food and feed derived from GM plants. Moreover the purpose, potential and limitations of the 90-day rodent feeding trial for the safety and nutritional testing of whole food and feed have been examined. Methods for single and repeated dose toxicity testing, reproductive and developmental toxicity testing and immunotoxicity testing, as described in OECD guideline tests for single well-defined chemicals are discussed and considered to be adequate for the safety testing of single substances including new products in GM food and feed. Various in silico and in vitro methods may contribute to the safety assessment of GM plant derived food and feed and components thereof, like (i) in silico searches for sequence homology and/or structural similarity of novel proteins or their degradation products to known toxic or allergenic proteins, (ii) simulated gastric and intestinal fluids in order to study the digestive stability of newly expressed proteins and in vitro systems for analysis of the stability of the novel protein under heat or other processing conditions, and (iii) in vitro genotoxicity test methods that screen for point mutations, chromosomal aberrations and DNA damage/repair. The current performance of the safety assessment of whole foods is mainly based on the protocols for low-molecular-weight chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, pesticides, food additives and contaminants. However without adaptation, these protocols have limitations for testing of whole food and feed. This primarily results from the fact that defined single substances can be dosed to laboratory animals at very large multiples of the expected human exposure, thus giving a large margin of safety. In contrast foodstuffs are bulky, lead to satiation and can only be included in the diet at much lower multiples of expected human intakes. When testing whole foods, the possible highest concentration of the GM food and feed in the laboratory animal diet may be limited because of nutritional imbalance of the diet, or by the presence of compounds with a known toxicological profile. The aim of the 90-days rodent feeding study with the whole GM food and feed is to assess potential unintended effects of toxicological and/or nutritional relevance and to establish whether the GM food and feed is as safe and nutritious as its traditional comparator rather than determining qualitative and quantitative intrinsic toxicity of defined food constituents. The design of the study should be adapted from the OECD 90-day rodent toxicity study. The precise study design has to take into account the nature of the food and feed and the characteristics of the new trait(s) and their intended role in the GM food and feed. A 90-day animal feeding trial has a large capacity (sensitivity and specificity) to detect potential toxicological effects of single well defined compounds. This can be concluded from data reported on the toxicology of a wide range of industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food substances, environmental, and agricultural chemicals. It is possible to model the sensitivity of the rat subchronic feeding study for the detection of hypothetically increased amount of compounds such as anti-nutrients, toxicants or secondary metabolites. With respect to the detection of potential unintended effects in whole GM food and feed, it is unlikely that substances present in small amounts and with a low toxic potential will result in any observable (unintended) effects in a 90-day rodent feeding study, as they would be below the no-observed-effect-level and thus of unlikely impact to human health at normal intake levels. Laboratory animal feeding studies of 90-days duration appear to be sufficient to pick up adverse effects of diverse compounds that would also give adverse effects after chronic exposure. This conclusion is based on literature data from studies investigating whether toxicological effects are adequately identified in 3-month subchronic studies in rodents, by comparing findings at 3 and 24 months for a range of different chemicals. The 90-day rodent feeding study is not designed to detect effects on reproduction or development other than effects on adult reproductive organ weights and histopathology. Analyses of available data indicate that, for a wide range of substances, reproductive and developmental effects are not potentially more sensitive endpoints than those examined in subchronic toxicity tests. Should there be structural alerts for reproductive/developmental effects or other indications from data available on a GM food and feed, then these tests should be considered. By relating the estimated daily intake, or theoretical maximum daily intake per capita for a given whole food (or the sum of its individual commercial constituents) to that consumed on average per rat per day in the subchronic 90-day feeding study, it is possible to establish the margin of exposure (safety margin) for consumers. Results obtained from testing GM food and feed in rodents indicate that large (at least 100-fold) 'safety' margins exist between animal exposure levels without observed adverse effects and estimated human daily intake. Results of feeding studies with feed derived from GM plants with improved agronomic properties, carried out in a wide range of livestock species, are discussed. The studies did not show any biologically relevant differences in the parameters tested between control and test animals. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"
